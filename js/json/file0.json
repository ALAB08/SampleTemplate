   "body": "I pray for fitness and health, and I do my share as well to achieve it.  The secret is to pray and to be happy. <b><i>— Dr. Rico Absin, anaesthesiologist</i></b><br><br>Fresh food and an active lifestyle are the key.  I do yoga and swimming for exercise, then we have a lot of home-cooked meals.  We minimize eating processed food, have no sodas nor powdered juice drinks at home.  I keep fit and healthy to avoid getting sick.  Mahal magkasakit.  <b><i>—Nadia Abesamis, biology professor </i></b><br><br>To keep fit, I go for a 24-km. bike ride three to four times a week. I also drink lots of milk, aside from taking vitamins A to Z (Alma to ZsaZsa.  Joke) – Andrew Mananquil, avid mountain biker . To keep fit and healthy, I enrolled myself in Walk Live classes by Cathy Carballo.  I figured, if I shell out money to exercise, I’d take it more seriously.  Also, I try really hard to stay away from sweets.  Usually, the effort proves futile though.  At least, I don’t drink and smoke.  <i><b>—Atty. Pristine Martinez-Raymond, EDLAW legal counsel </b></i><br><br>At 7am daily when possible, I do a five-kilometer run in the oval with my iPod Nano on earphones.  I also do good cardio and weight-bearing workout.  There’s no crowd,  and it’s a great time to be by yourself – just the track, your music, and you.  I also do mountain bike.  <b><i>—Babbu Wenceslao, proprietor</i></b><br><br>I do moderate exercise on the treadmill, 30 minutes, three times a week.  I eat blanched veggies for breakfast two to three times a week, and have lots to fruits.  I have more fish than meat in my diet.  And I have a happy marriage – that’s why I’m fit and healthy. <b><i>— Baby T. Armogenia, married to Architect Rene Armogenia, proprietors, South Sea Resort</i></b> <br><br> I walk an hour and a half everyday, except Fridays which is my rest day.  I try to eat more fish and vegetables.  I feel at lot better.  <b><i>—Rudy Diaz, sugarplanter</i></b> <br><br>For a healthy lifestyle, I eat the right food, I exercise daily, and I have a regular check up with my doctor.  Most of all, I have a positive outlook in life.  Feeling healthy also comes from within.  <b><i>—Janet Gravador, proprietor, Dumaguete Grandeur Travel & Tours</i></b> <br><br>How do I stay in great shape? a balanced diet, cross-training five times a week (boxing/muaythai/running),  and lots of sex. I do these so I can perform to my optimum <br>(family/work/church/community).<b><i>  – Ed Dames, sports enthusiast</i></b> <br><br>I’ve always embodied three things to keep fit and healthy: balanced diet, regular exercise, and a happy disposition. I embrace these things as a matter of lifestyle, not as a trend or a pastime.  <b><i>– Atty. Dinah Chu, EDLAW legal counsel </i></b><br><br>I ride my mountain bike along the rough and hilly terrain of Valencia to enjoy, and to commune  with nature.  At the same time, it makes me physically fit.  Exercise through biking helps lower the cholesterol, uric, and sugar levels in my body.  <b><i>—  Rev. Elmer Saa, Silliman Church pastor</i></b> <br><br>I stay fit and healthy by taking long brisk walks, and by drinking lots of water. Dumaguete is so small, everything can be reached by walking.  I exercise while I do my errands. <b><i>– Engr. Rona Valente, designer-proprietor, Veronica’s Closet Online</i></b><br> <br>One must look at fitness the spiritual way, knowing that our body is God’s temple.  I don’t want to do anything harmful to it.  I still indulge in my favorite food once in a while, but I exercise everyday for at least 30 minutes with either yoga, badminton, or mile walk with Cathy Carballo. <b><i>-- Aurora Jane R. Miranda, businesswoman </i></b><br><br>I join marathons organized by various clubs in different places.  To prepare for that, I run in the morning, and sometimes do kettle bells after work.  Aside from the fact that such activities keep me fit and healthy, it feels good being able to finish a marathon; and kettle bells/running give me more energy at work.   <b><i>-- Karen Baena-Bigay,   Foundation University </i></b><br>",

By now it was dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them. 18 A strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough. 19 When they had rowed three or three and a half miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the water; and they were terrified. 20 But he said to them, “It is I; don’t be afraid.” 21Then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading. </span><br><br>    According to our scripture text, the disciples were out one time enjoying what could have been a peaceful boat ride across the lake to Capernaum. Suddenly, the wind started to blow hard, and the waters grew rough. Panic-stricken, the disciples tried to manage the situation by rowing steadily, but apparently, their efforts were in vain. After striving desperately to manage the situation, they suddenly saw Jesus walking on water, coming to their rescue. The disciples did not immediately recognize the Lord. They thought they had seen a ghost, and became even more terrified. They only realized it was Jesus when he finally said, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“It is I. Don’t be afraid.”</span><div><i><br></i>    What gives this account an interesting twist is the fact that according to the gospel writers Matthew, Mark, and John, this particular incident happened just a few hours after Jesus performed the feeding of the 5,000 – a miracle that literally shook the entire region.</div><div><br>It must have been very frustrating for Jesus to discover that after being witnesses to one of the greatest miracles ever performed by the Lord, his disciples still failed to grasp the real meaning of faith.</div><div><br>    How telling this is of the frailty of our faith and understanding of the Lord’s ways. One moment we are in awe of God’s power, and in another moment, we shrink back in the face of fear.</div><div><br>    This theological tension of faith and fear, and fear and faith will always be part of our human frailty. This is the glaring reality that we see from our scripture reading. Human as we all are, our faith is so volatile. We constantly need to hear the voice of Jesus telling us, “It is I, don’t be afraid.”<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Be still</span><br>    In spiritual language, stillness is not the absence of action. On the contrary, stillness is putting our faith to work.In the Old Testament (1 Kings 19: 1-12), we read a famous account where prophet Elijah, while in Mount Horeb, waited for the Lord to pass by. If you remember, three things happened: the great wind came, a mighty earthquake came, and finally, there came fire— but in all three, we are told, the Lord was not there.</div><div><br>    Where was the Lord? Well, according to the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible, the Lord was in the sound of sheer silence.</div><div><br>    In an article titled <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">‘Silence is to Dwell in’</span> in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Christianity Today</span> (Aug. 7, 2000), “Stillness is a kind of silence that is large enough, long enough, and intentional enough to open a sacred space for the Holy One to enter. In other words, stillness, in the truest sense of it, is our ability to accept both what God chooses to do or not to do in our situations.”</div><div><br>    You see, the disciples were coming from a very self-serving and dictating concept of faith. After the feeding of the 5,000 when the people saw the power of Jesus, they were even willing to make him King.<br>    You see, they only wanted Jesus for as long as he served their purposes, but the moment they got what they wanted, they leave Jesus behind.</div><div><br>    You see, this kind of faith is dangerous and very unsafe. Unfortunately though, this is the kind of faith that the world promotes these days. It is a kind of faith that is making a mockery of God, and his sovereignty upon our lives.</div><div><br>    Brothers and sisters, being still can be the hardest thing to do when we are in the thick of crisis or when things are falling apart.</div><div><br>    But you see, when all is said and done, there is greater wisdom when we give God the space that he wants to move in our lives.</div><div><br>    When God declared his favor upon the Israelites, Moses uttered the Lord’s awesome promise to his people Ex 14:13 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you …14 The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.”</span><br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Be sure</span><br>    When Jesus said the words, “It is I”, he was drawing the attention of his disciples away from the rising water, and away from the strong winds. It’s not that Jesus was drawing their attention away from reality of the situation.</div><div><br>    On the contrary, Jesuswas bringing them to a right perspective of the problem. But you see, this is the problem when panic sets in.</div><div><br>    In my final year in nursing school, our class had to go to a month-long community exposure in an isolated town in Tarlac. My best friend and I were partners one time, and we were conducting our house visits. As we were walking, low and behold, a big, black, wild boar suddenly emerged from nowhere, and it walking toward us. At that moment, my best friend and I were panic-stricken. I could still remember the feeling of sheer fear— your blood just rises to your head, something in your mind just kind of detaches from reality, and you get this impulse to do something really daring but stupid.</div><div><br>    This is the problem with panic. Panic often leads us to miscalculate the whole situation. We end up making impulsive decisions that are arbitrary and counterproductive.</div><div><br>    It was just sheer grace that the wild boar just suddenly walked away. And when the boar was a few meters away from us, that was the time when we both ran for our lives. That was the fastest run I ever made my entire life. My poor best friend had to massage my legs the whole night!</div><div><br>    The key to being sure is perspective. It is the ability to see every situation in our lives from the viewpoint of God’s sovereignty and eternal purposes.</div><div><br>    In this life, we will have our share of strong winds and rough waters. But as always, Jesus leads us back to safe shores. It may take a while for us to be rescued. It may take some time for the storm to quiet down.</div><div><br>    And so while in the midst of it all, while our boat is being pounded from all sides, and while the strong winds refuse to stop, we, the people of God, resolve to be still, and to be sure, holding ever so strongly on to the sweet words of Jesus, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“It is I. Don’t be afraid.”</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br><BR>    <BR></div>",

They have all been waiting impatiently for this- rehearsing their movements for weeks, waiting for their costumes to arrive. It’s their last dance, late in the day, the end of another Fiest.  <br><br>Another Fiest-  and whatever the occasion, all big fiestas follow the same pattern-- Parades, street dancing, Artistas flown in from Manila,  barangay dance contests at City Hall, speeches, crowning of the Queen, awarding of prizes for the best of  This and That, and then a final dispersal through dark streets full of trash. <br><br>But a Fiest is something to look forward to, something to plan and work for with friends and strangers. Everyone is focused on the coming occasion with endless rehearsals.  It becomes a minor industry and employs a lot of people,– to design the costumes, sew the materials, choreograph the dances, create hairstyles and make-up appropriate to the theme. <br><br>Fabric stores go out of stock. Local hotels get fully booked. Local bands get hired, local restaurants set up extra outdoor sites, food sellers set up outdoor booths,  children buy bottled water  and snacks to sell to the crowds.  For the really big fiestas, preparation may take months.<br><br>At last The Day arrives, and the Fiest rolls on with violent activity from morning to noon and night --and then is gone. Streets become quiet. Costumes are abandoned. Business falls off.  Bills have to be paid, with little money left to pay them. It’s a pattern that pervades the culture.<br><br>For these girls in the picture there may be a moment they will remember, but it’s also the end of their story. What follows will be less. No special clothes, no special snacks, no special times where every move they make is subject to attention, praise and blame. Ordinary life resumes in its own small way, with nothing to anticipate day by day but more of the same. <br><br>Children are impatient for the Great Fiest that will come to them some day. The day when they will be set free from the endless rehearsals being conducted for their futures: grade school, high school, homework-- every action subject to constant supervision and frowns --from Mothers, Lolas, Teachers. They wait in saddness for the great Fiest, the final release, when they will be grown up and free! <br><br>That’s what they think. Someone should tell them: Don’t be sad that your  Fiest is long in coming. <br>",

There are many published papers, many of which have been written by scientists at Silliman University, on the positive impacts of MPAs on the marine biodiversity, the fishery, and the socioeconomic life of fisher communities in the Philippines.<br><br> Most of the more than 1,000 MPAs in the Philippines reported thus far are small (few to 10s of hectares) and established and co-managed by LGUs, NGOs, and POs, often assisted technically by academe, under the legal framework of the Local Government Code, the Fishery Code and the local ordinances. They are generally funded from local sources, notably the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) of LGUs, although a few receive assistance from other internal funding sources and foreign sources.<br><br> Only very few (some half a dozen) MPAs are large (100s of km2 in area). These large MPAs have been established and managed by the Protected Areas Management Boards under the chairmanship of the Regional Directors of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The legal framework is the NIPAS Act. All of these MPAs are covered by Presidential Proclamations, but only few have specific laws enacted by the Philippine Congress that mandate steady and regular budgetary allotments from the annual Philippine National Appropriations Act.  <br><br> In general, the financial support of government for MPAs, except for a couple of marine reserves, is not adequate to ensure  efficient management and protection of these MPAs over the long term, hence the need plan for sustainable funding. The exceptions derive their financial support from user fees and payments for ecosystem or environmental services. There are several examples from among the Philippine MPAs that illustrate the nature of financial support that might be considered sustainable, given the present conditions obtaining in the country.<br><br> From published information and from personal knowledge and experience, some half a dozen recommendations for long term sustainable funding of Philippine MPAs have been given to DENR, including payments of environmental services, user fees, regular appropriations from the IRA of local government units, endowment funds from charitable institutions specializing in environmental conservation, etc.  However, these recommendations are premised on the condition that these MPAs are managed well in such ways that marine biodiversity and fishery resources are conserved and the general environment remains healthy. The reasoning is that fund donors are interested only in marine protected areas that are well managed and protected. In other words, such protected areas are judged successful. <br><br> The current situation among community-based marine reserves in the Visayas, where only about a third of the more than 500 reserves has been judged successful, is not one in which donors can be persuaded to readily give their financial support. <br><br>So I hope that MPA managers and policy makes can be challenged to manage their marine reserves well to ensure long term financial support. <br>  <br>",

   "body": "<div>(Email: <a href=\"mailto:docmequi@yahoo.com\">docmequi@yahoo.com</a> )</div><div><br></div>The Amlañons and Zamboanguitañons could! So why not Dumagueteños? <br><br>I was a two-packs-a-day smoker myself back in the 1960s, but I gave up smoking instantly at the precise moment when I saw the US Surgeon General on television decreeing that smoking is unhealthy. So, personally, I believe it’s a matter of will power and self-discipline. And it appears that president-apparent Noynoy Aquino could not be a model to the Filipino youth, who according to news reports, are among the biggest and youngest group of smokers in Asia. Aquino refused, when requested, to refrain from smoking for just one day, during the celebration of “World No Tobacco Day”, observed around the world every year on May 31…a day that is <i>“meant to encourage a 24-hour period of abstinence from all forms of tobacco consumption across the globe. The day is further intended to draw global attention to the widespread prevalence of tobacco use and to negative health effects, which currently lead to deaths worldwide annually. The member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) created World No Tobacco Day (WNTD) in 1987.” (Wikipedia).</i><br><br>The theme set by the World Health Organization (WHO) for this 2010 WNTD is, “Gender and Tobacco, with an Emphasis on Marketing to Women,” aimed to draw attention to the sex-specific effects of tobacco use, thus the need for gender-specific tobacco control strategies. <br><br>In a report of Dona Pazzibugan in the Phil Daily Inquirer, first posted (12/04/2008), a study by the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance, showed that “Women smokers in the country are getting younger…with three out of 10 female Filipino smokers in their early teens…and that 18.7 percent of young Filipino females between the ages of 13 and 25 smoked cigarettes.”<div><br>\"What was more alarming was that three out of 10 Filipina smokers were 13 to 15 years old…The statistics on girls as young as 13 becoming addicted to smoking are really alarming, and something has to be done about it,\" said Dr. Maricar Limpin, executive director of Framework Convention on Tobacco Control Alliance Philippines (FCAP). The youngest child that FCAP has on record was only six years old when he started smoking.<br><br>According to the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI), the risk of a heart attack for women who both smoke and use oral contraception is greater than for non-smokers. FNRI’s other warnings:<br>• Women who smoke are less fertile and pregnant female smokers are twice as likely to have a miscarriage.<br>• Women who smoke and use an IUD (intrauterine device) are more likely to develop pelvic inflammatory disease than women who do not.<br>• Women smokers are at greater risk to develop cancer of the cervix.<br>• Women who smoke are likely to reach menopause earlier and are more likely to suffer from osteoporosis and have a hysterectomy.<br>• Babies of women who smoke during pregnancy are lighter and are more likely to be stillborn or die during the first few weeks.</div><div><br>Young people are also regularly exposed to second-hand and even third-hand smoke, the residue left in a room after someone smokes, which often sticks to furniture and clothes. Infants and young children who play with items that have been exposed to cigarette smoke can eventually develop asthma and other smoking-related diseases.<br><br>“Children are the most vulnerable to second-hand smoke, which is six times more poisonous than mainstream smoke. Cigarette smoke is being imposed on them even if they don’t like it. This is a violation of their right to remain healthy and breathe clean air,' said Dr Limpin. About six in ten children live in Filipino houses where other people smoke. Figures from FCAP further show that about 200,000 young Filipinos will suffer from smoking-related diseases early on in their lives, and about 80,000 will perish from it. <br><br>However, the good news is that Negros Oriental is “gearing up for a smoke-free province with the aid of legislation.” Board Member Marcelo Adanza, who authored the proposed ordinance, said that he was challenged by the successful implementation of smoke-free regulations in the municipalities of Amlan and Zamboanguita. Bernie Maniego, health director of Framework Convention Alliance on Tobacco Free Philippines, said Negros Oriental is the first that proposed a local ordinance to promote a smoke-free province, and that if passed and its implementation sustained through political will from the local chief executives, it would serve as a model for other localities to emulate.<br><br>Last July 17, 2009 Amlan Councilor Edmund Tubac and Mayor Betham Dela Cruz, along with more than a thousand government officials, students and residents, walked three kilometers to launch the ordinance and declared Amlan a smoke-free zone. On this occasion, Negros Oriental Governor Emilio Macias II, himself a non-smoker, lauded the town for being the first in the region to pass an ordinance that promotes the health and wellness of its more than 22,000 constituents. Governor Macias said:<br><br>“I don’t smoke, I don’t drink. And that is why at 75, I am still active. Smoking is supposed to be dangerous for our health and yet our government, as with any other governments in the world, did not stop the production of tobacco because of the taxes derived from it. But if we look into the matter intently, we will find that the taxes we earn will not be enough even to pay for the expenses of curing those who contracted the diseases from smoking.”<br><br>With the re-election of Governor Dr. Emilio Macias III, it is anticipated that passage of the no-smoking provincial ordinance is a done deal, and this brings us to the question on whether the incoming leadership of the City government, Mayor Manuel Sagarbarria, Vice-Mayor Alan Gel Cordova, and members of the City Council will move accordingly and act expeditiously on this urgent problem that bears a significant impact on the health and wellness of the young people in University Town. Since reports indicate that there are a substantial number of girls and young women smokers who will give birth to damaged and unhealthy babies of the next generation, shouldn’t this be a priority concern of everyone?<br><br>Thus, I urge the student councils of all the academic institutions of University Town to unite and launch a campaign for the enactment of a City resolution that will make smoking and all practices related to it, against the law, and violators to be assessed stiff fines—or thrown to jail.<br><br>You will have a champion in the youthful and idealistic Vice-Mayor Alan Cordova whom you have voted to that position and who will be the presiding officer of the City Council. As for Noynoy Aquino, whom you also voted to the highest political power in our country, he said that you favored him over the presidential candidates “despite the knowledge that he is a smoker. “<br><br>Let not that statement of his deter you from following the late Pope John Paul II exhortation that he addressed to you on World Youth Day 2000: “I am thinking especially of you young people, who experience in a special way the blessing of life, and have a duty not to waste it…”<br><br>Smoking is not a good choice in fulfilling the duty not to waste the blessing of life.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div>",

I find myself amused by the confusing mixture of strength and stupidity that the protagonist carries. She is obviously clever, yet she continues to back her husband who cheated on her several times over the course of their marriage. <div><br> Filipino women have been ingrained with the thought that no matter what, you have to keep your family together. Everything we do must be for the good of the family. If the husband is cheating and you’ve become aware of it, suck it up and pretend everything is good. Eventually, it will go away. Besides, he is going home to you anyway, not to the mistress. </div><div><br> I would love to vomit on anyone who tells me this. But as much as I would like to say that Filipino women are more modern now and are able to stand up for themselves, it simply isn’t true.</div><div><br> I have written about this several times before and I do hope someone out there heeds it. Filipino women looking for love overseas have to be very careful with their choice of men. Remember how someone would tell you “what if he’s an axe murderer?” when you meet someone online? Well, sometimes it is actually true. </div><div><br> I recently helped a mainstream Australian women’s magazine track a Filipino woman down for an interview. Her name is Melissa Campbell, a former nightclub singer from Pampanga. She has two kids and lives in the middle of nowhere in New South Wales. To prove how “middle of nowhere” it was exactly, we had to take a plane for over an hour then drive for almost four hours to get to the town where she lives. It was straight out of a small town movie, complete with lifeless streets and kindly neighbours. </div><div><br> Why is Melissa so hot to the Aussie press these days? Well, mainly because she is married to Des Campbell, an Aussie who was recently convicted of pushing his last wife off a cliff in 2005 to get her money. According to reports, around a month after he committed the crime, he went on the Pinay Heart website to find his next wife and met Melissa. They got married in January 2006 and now have two little kids. </div><div><br> Apart from a scattering of small quotes in the media, Melissa has not been interviewed by anyone else. So no one knows exactly if she knew about her husband’s past when they got together. The magazine thought that maybe a fellow Pinay would be able to reach out to her, and she’d finally tell her story. They were right in a way. We were the only ones who got that close to her and was able to speak to her more before she turned us down. Based on our meetings, Melissa is quite timid and has a hard time communicating herself in English, and even in Tagalog. She said the media has harassed her so many times that she gets nervous around them. The only reason she even entertained us for as long as she did was because she was able to speak to a fellow Filipina. </div><div><br> I was hopeful she’d accept the interview proposal, especially after the magazine offered financial help for the exclusive interview. But alas, we got shot down after her visit to her in-laws. </div><div>  <br>The fact that she is still close with her husband’s family tells me she hasn’t given up on him yet, even when it’s looking like he’s going to be getting over 20 years jail time. Doting wife or stupid wife? Or maybe scared wife? I can only imagine what she is going through – on her own in the middle of nowhere with two kids, no job and bills to pay, no friends or family nearby. Was this what she expected when he took her to Australia? Was this the promise land she was hoping for? Is the grass here looking greener now than when she was still in the Philippines? </div><div><br> Another Filipina I know who is married to an Australian guy is going through a different marital hell of her own. He’s openly cheating on her every weekend and she can’t do anything about it. She stays home to watch their daughter while he goes gallivanting somewhere. She says she will do anything to keep her family together – even suffer in silent desperation for the rest of her life. Very melodramatic. Very soap operatic. Very Tagalog movie. Again, she has no one to lean on. She doesn’t have many friends and all her family members are in the Philippines. This wasn’t the life she was hoping for, definitely not what she had in mind when he whisked her off to the land down under. </div><div><br> So again, be careful what you wish for. Just because it looks greener on the other side of the fence, doesn’t mean it’s not filled with killer pesticides – or killer husbands. <br></div></div>",

   "body": "By REV. BERNADETTE AMISTOSO-MORALES<br><i><a href=\"mailto:pastorbernie@yahoo.com\">pastorbernie@yahoo.com</a></i><br><br><br><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; \"><span style=\"FONT-SIZE: 14pt \">In and out of season</span></span></div><div>In 1992 Dennis Lee Curtis was arrested in the United States for stealing. Upon inspection the police found a sheet of small paper inside  his wallet. On the paper were  written the following: 1) I will not kill anyone unless I have to; 2) I will only take cash and food stamps but no checks; 3) I will rob only at night ; 4) I will not wear a mask; 5) I will not rob mini-marts and 7-11 stores; 6) If chased by vehicle, I will not put the lives of innocent civilians on the line; 7) I will rob only seven months out of the year; and 8) I will rob the rich to give to the poor.  Obviously, this thief had set his own rules and standards. But certainly, when he stood before the court, he was not judged based on the standards and rules that he had set for himself but by the higher law of the state. <br><br>Like this robber, many of us today have also created our own standards and rules of morality. We think that by doing so we could adopt for ourselves a level of decency and uprightness. Only to find out that our standards reveal that they still fall short of God’s will.  Paul and Timothy lived in a time of great Christian persecution.  Would they still uphold their faith or bend their convictions in order to give in to the pressures of a more popular religion and the powerful people who believed in it? In the face of these conflicting forces threatening God’s people, Paul’s faith and courage rose.  Paul exhorts the young Timothy, <i>“Preach the Word.  Be prepared in season and out of season…</i>(2 Tim. 4:2)  Why do we need to preach the Word? <br><br><b>TRUTH </b><br>The ultimate and most vital source of truth is God’s Word.  This is why Paul said to Timothy, <i>“Preach the Word.”</i>  God’s Word is truth.  God’s Word brings people to the knowledge of the true God and obedience to his perfect will through Jesus Christ. But you see, there are many practical challenges to consider. First, there are many sincere and church-going Christians who do not devote ample time and effort to the genuine study of the Bible.  The reasons may be varied and complex.  But for many, the reading and deep study of the Bible has become an option than a serious priority.  As a result, many  professing believers cannot even articulate what they believe , more so, defend their faith when it is challenged.  Another practical situation is that many churches and congregations have become too engrossed with the busyness of church life that too little attention is given to the spiritual feeding of the people.  The result is costly. The church plummets into spiritual ignorance.  And many self-confessed believers become easy targets of cults, false religions and deceptive teachings. <br><br>Friends, let us also remember that the matter of truth is deeper than just quoting scriptures. It is also more than achieving theological sophistication. Truth is allowing the Spirit of God to bring us to godly repentance.  Truth is our sincere acknowledgment of our genuine need for Christ’s forgiveness, direction and wisdom. Truth is putting into practice the tenets of righteousness, justice and mercy in every sphere of our existence — from the most personal and intimate area of our life to our engagements in the community and beyond. <br><br><b>TRAINING</b> <br>Training, in the context of our study today, is the repeated and consistent application of truth. <i>“Be prepared in season and out of season;”</i>  Friends, truth is not about one time acts of heroism or occasional seasons of obedience. Training is about achieving consistency.  It is learning to live by the truth “in season” and “out of season.” The “in seasons” are our happy moments we are almost effortless in our pursuits of truth. The “out of seasons” are moments when, in the pursuit of truth, our very lives and reputation are put on the line.  It is those moments of difficulties when pursuing the truth becomes a costly and an inconvenient sacrifice.<br> <br>In 2006, former US Vice President Al Gore launched a global educational campaign on the issue global warming through the film documentary entitled, “An Inconvenient Truth.”  The film boldly calls nations around the globe to take serious action in the stewardship of creation before it’s too late.  Sure, everyone is talking about caring for the environment but when it comes down to it, are we prepared to change our ways?  Will a fastfood chain be willing to put money on biodegradable cups and paper food boxes that are more expensive than styro materials? Will an industry be wiling to put more money on earth-friendly industrial cleaning materials that are far more costly than commercial ones that are half the price? Truth is easy to romanticize sometimes, but when the season is difficult, many take the easier and more convenient path. <br><br>Putting it closer to home, we ask ourselves some very practical questions. Are we seriously putting the Word of God to work? Are we willing to initiate reconciliation even when believe we are not at fault? Are we willing to exercise utmost grace and composure even when we are maligned or unfairly treated?  Will we exercise generosity even when our resources are scarce and few?  Will we exercise loyalty and fidelity to those we love even when they become unlovable and difficult?  Will we make compromises in our faith and conviction just to earn a few extra money or be under the good graces of our superiors?   Will we have the courage to confront those who have offended us face to face than resort to gossiping, backbiting and character assassination? Will we stand by Christ only when we are in season, or even when we are out of season? <br><br>My prayer for us today, friends, is that we may realize how dangerous, volatile and critical the times have become.  We cannot believe everything we hear.  We should not swallow everything that we are taught by the world. As God’s people in Jesus Christ, we need something strong and solid to guide us in the living of these days. We need a firm foundation to stand on.  Let us welcome the Word of God in our lives.  Let us preach it faithfully— personally and even as a Church.  Let us believe that when we have the truth and when we have allowed ourselves to be trained by the truth—— we can stand firm. We can be immovable.  We can stand up against any false accusation, deception or lie. We can face the future, whatever it brings—— in season and out of season. <br><br></div>",

Gone, at least for a while, is the notorious 12-0 win and the 100% voter turn out as dictated by the ruling Lords in Maguindanao..  “In the ARMM, I received so many SMS or text messages, from friends and associates,  telling me with pride that Noynoy won in their provinces and cities”.  <br><br>There  were some chaotic precincts.  But  the military, police and  Comelec  cooperated.

Officials of  the  Mindanao Development Authority and the  new Commission on Muslim Filipinos  are  among those  tainted by  controversial ‘midnight appointments’ by the expiring Arroyo  regime.<br><br>Implementing rules and of  both commissions  still have to ironed out.

Can he stamp out corruption? Can he alleviate the plight of the poor in this country? In America, they would say, will he really walk the talk?  Or are we to see a repeat of the same old familiar faces with the same old familiar routine in government? <BR><BR>For  the commeration of Independence Day, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo  spent 10 million  pesos to fund 10 floats highlighting  the achievements of her administration. This is her Swan Song, and the profligate spending on floats is just a clear indication of  her lack of sensitivity to the abject poverty of  the majority of the urban and rural poor comprising 70 percent of the population. <BR><BR>It is often said that if indeed people  can see her achievements and feel its effects on their daily life, there is no need to have floats costing  a million each, when such amount could be spent on more worthy causes.<BR> <BR>Thus, appearances are the most  important  issue to the  outgoing PGMA government. <BR><BR>This is a study in contrast,  Noynoy seen in his  “awshucks”  stance, with his sister Kris having to correct his sartorial sense as he does not really care about appearances.  It is said that walang nagawa and walang alam si Noynoy sounds familiar.  This is a two edged  presumption which will go either way -- he can be effective  because he is a clean slate, with no discernible agenda. Or he can be manipulated by people around him who are now fighting for lucrative posts. <BR><BR>Reflecting on the significance of Independence Day, Noynoy should take it to heart that he is the President of this appointments to the Cabinet as a springboard to unite the nation  towards the path to sustainable development. <BR><BR>More than ever, Noynoy needs People Power, the support of the people, to push reforms.  He needs all of us to fight corruption, which have metastasized into unbelievable proportions due to the mismanagement and greed of the past. <BR><BR>Rome was not built in a day, and if we are to move forward, we hope and pray that we are all ready to take our place and step up as citizens of an independent republican nation. <BR><BR>Congratulations and good luck to President-elect Noynoy Aquino! <BR>",

   "body": "<div><br></div><i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">h.cecilia7@gmail.com</span></i><br><br>ZURICH, SWITZERLAND — In Europe where I am at the moment, the labels “green” “bio”,”eco” or “organic” are by now familiar to the general population. There’s no escaping daily news and information about the severe and sometimes irreversible damage the planet has already sustained, or the call for people to change attitudes and behavior in many aspects of everyday life.  But this is hard!  As one commentator says, most people are “self-centered, short –sighted, intent on their comfort and averse to sacrifice.”   And yet, to a small extent, environmental awareness is influencing producer and consumer behavior here, as demonstrated by the availability of products certified environmentally acceptable, and also by the organic food sections in most supermarkets. <br><br>In our case, the general population has as yet little understanding of the importance of environmental concerns, as do few political leaders. Which is why it was remarkable that in 2005,  both Negros Occidental and Oriental governors signed a MOA towards the attainment of  an environmental dream called   “Negros Organic Island.” Forward-looking, ambitious and  very difficult without strong political will, it aimed to promote and develop organic agriculture towards food security and safety, and to protect the island’s biodiversity, (at serious risk from human encroachment and exploitation, from contamination in chemical agriculture, and climate change.) <div>  <br>Now, all of five years later, an ordinance authored by Board Member Lea Bromo seeks to “mainstream organic agriculture as a main agricultural practice in Negros Oriental…”  The proposed ordinance is excellent, necessary and worthy of support,, and moreover, implements the national law promoting organic agriculture.  <br><br>Some comments on the present draft of the ordinance: <br><br>Stated first in the resolution’s enumeration of objectives is “to capture the burgeoning export market for organic products” abroad.  While trade benefits may be envisioned, it should be recognized that in fact the market is still small. Organic food products account for only a 4% market share in Germany, already the biggest buyer of such products.  Further, European Union and other standards and certification processes are stringent and compliance may require particular effort, time and resources.  <br><br>Certainly, more basic objectives should be foregrounded: food security and improved human health, management of natural resources including the conservation of biodiversity and the restoration of soil fertility, the reduction of pollution and other environmental harms, as well as the empowerment and improved economic situation of farmers. <br><br>The ordinance seems to show a bias for plant agriculture and mentions crops, seed banks, fertilizers and the like. The ethical and organic production of food animals is implied but not specifically mentioned. Animal feeds and medical practices in this area also need to be addressed to protect human health, animal welfare and environmental contamination. <br><br>While the ordinance focuses its strategies and resources on “small-holder communities” and ‘marginalized farmers,”   an area of concern requires further deliberation:  policies and strategies to address monoculture and large-scale agribusinesses.  The ordinance is weak in its language for dealing with these economically more powerful and in land area more significant agricultural sectors when it speaks of seeking to “influence” or “encourage” them towards organic practices.  More concrete measures could be envisaged and negotiated:  devoting defined and then growing land areas, inputs and resources, and perhaps even a percentage of profits for organic agriculture. There is no way that the ordinance’s declared policy to “mainstream organic agriculture as a main agricultural practice in Negros Oriental” can be realized if monocultures and large agribusinesses are let off the hook.  Nor could Negros ever give itself the title of “Organic Island” as dreamed by two governors in 2005.  At best, there would be pockets of organic agriculture amidst extensive sugar and other large-scale agricultural enterprises.  It might also be helpful under the definition of terms to specify what constitutes large-scale agriculture.-  <br><br>Worth exploring and not just for Negros Oriental, is the idea of a tax on environmentally harmful agricultural practices, or on the other hand, tax incentives for organic production. But exerting legal pressure and thereby generating the resources to counter chemical agriculture will require national law if existing laws do not already address this.. The province could be instrumental in encouraging environmental lawyers to conceptualize new legal instruments.  <br><br>For the success of this crucial endeavor, significant resources are needed. This province’s natural vocation is agriculture  and there should be no higher budget priority other than for health, than the development of organic agriculture.  This is a challenge the provincial government should meet and in support of this ambition for the province, component LGUs should cooperate with strong programs for their agricultural sectors.  New and not-so-new administrations will take office next month, will it be the same piecemeal, haphazard, stop-and-go approach to governance or might we see some vision, direction and bold moves for once? <br><br></div>",

   "body": "<i>dominique.cimafranca@gmail.com</i><br><br>In what must have been a first for any writers workshop in the country, last summer's Ateneo de Davao Writers Workshop featured stories from the genre of fanfic.  As the screener for the applications, I take responsibility for the ensuing misadventures; but I confess I also found much amusement in the resulting collision of cultures between the panel and the fellows.<br><br>Fanfic, if you're not aware of the term, is short for fan fiction.  Its writers take characters from juvenile books, TV series, video games, and anime and cobble together new stories around them.  Because of this lack of originality, the genre doesn't get much respect.  But because of the popularity of the source material, many young people gravitate to the genre, either as readers or writers.<br><br>For our panel of award-winning Davao writers, fanfic was a new and confusing – and perhaps also mildly unpleasant – experience.  The fanfic stories in the workshop drew heavily from F<i>inal Fantasy</i>, a Japanese video game, and <i>Gossip Girl</i>, a scandalous American teen television drama.  While the language was competent, the final product came out awkward, stilted, and inauthentic.  Quoting one panelist, the poet Don Pagusara: “Why are you writing this?”<br><br>Despite the reaction I like to think that both sides came out better for the exchange: for the panel, a view into the popular culture and the sources of inspiration for today's youth; and for the fellows, explanations and illustrations of just why fanfic is so bad.<br><br>And just why is fanfic so bad?  Some of my views as gleaned from the discussions in the workshop:<br><br>     1. Fanfic bespeaks of laziness and lack of imagination on the part of the writer. Instead of creating their own characters and settings, they merely appropriate what others have built.<br><br>     2. Because they use characters and settings which are, within their sphere of readership, already well established, fanfic writers do not take care to fully flesh out these elements.  Readers unfamiliar with the source material are left high and dry.<br><br>     3. Moreover, characters from TV and cartoons do not translate well into the page.  On the screen, the frenetic action may hide their flatness and one-dimensionality; when put into prose, which demands greater introspection on the part reader, these faults come to the fore.<br><br>     4. Likewise, character development is almost nonexistent in fanfic stories.  Because they do not own the property, because they may be careful not to offend other fans, or simply because they love the characters too much, fanfic authors do not push the boundaries of their protagonists.<br><br>     5. Characters in fanfic stories do not have flaws.  In the minds of their writers, the characters are perfect; in fact, too perfect to properly describe in words.  In the prose medium, which relies on words, this is a fatal flaw.<br><br>     6. Worse still, some fanfic writers may actually be infatuated with the characters they write.  This is so common that it even has a name within the fanfic community: the Mary Sue syndrome. Not only does this make for unbearable reading, it is downright creepy.<br><br>     7. Even if well-written, fanfic stories cannot be published professionally because the characters and settings are owned another author.  At best, they are limited to the dark corners of Internet forums; at worst, they may be subject to lawsuits for copyright infringement.<br><br>Fanfic authors will claim that it was never their aim to publish these stories in the mainstream, that it was done simply for fun.  But that also exposes its inherent weakness of fanfic: if fanfic writers don't take their craft of writing seriously, why should anyone?<br><br>From a creative point of view, writing fanfic is a barren endeavor. Fanfic writers only play in an imaginary world created by another.  The offspring cannot be truly called their own.  The effort might have been better spent in birthing new characters and settings that could grow into something bigger, or at least something different.<br><br>In a way, the appeal of fanfic is nigh irresistible.  They sources from which they draw are popular and their fan base dedicated and, well, fanatical.  Their wild and colorful worlds provide escape from dreary realities.  But there is a point when escape becomes abandonment.<br><br>In this regard, fanfic writers abandon the responsibility they have to their own communities: instead of drawing from the people and the places around them they dwell on foreign situations, attitudes, and mores.  This responsibility weighs all the more heavier for writers from a culture like ours that exists only in the literary margins of the world.  If young Filipino writers prefer to write about other America or Japan, who will write about the Philippines?  Quoting panelist Mac Tiu: “Leave America to the Americans.”<br><br>In any other workshop, fanfic would never have made the cut.  To be honest, I'm not sure I want to experience in future workshops.  Like fanfic, the novelty wears thin pretty quickly.  I did draw one important lesson from the exercise, though, and that's the urgent need to reach out to the young.  Perhaps by making genuinely Filipino literary works more appealing to young writers, we can do our part to rouse them from the solipsism of fanfic.  <br>",

   "body": "<div>(Email: <a href=\"mailto:docmequi@yahoo.com\">docmequi@yahoo.com</a> )</div><div><br></div>The title here is from an email sent to me by a colleague of the Friends of the Environment of Negros Oriental (FENOr), which counts among its members the eminent former DENR Secretary and CHED Chairman Dr. Angel Alcala, officials and members of academe, and several prominent residents of Negros Oriental:“In the Negros Chronicle (June 6) is a half page article by Herminio Teves on jatropha as the plant that would uplift our country from poverty and ecological degradation. I have set some of my thoughts here. I believe we, the FENOr, should write and publish a counter article because jatropha plantations are also a burden to ecology.  Mr. Teves’ article only shows in glowing terms what this plant can do, meaning, it can be made into oil, and oil is what the world wants. What about planting food? The Tamlang Valley was meant for food production!  Food production in the organic way is what our people need.  The organic way is the ecological way.  And we need to be planting trees, not clearing forest lands, not even killing other trees for jatropha that will feed cars and machinery.” <br><br>Not knowing much about jatropha myself, but addicted to the National Geographic advice to “Live Curious”, I rushed to my laptop and in the Google search box, typed: the good and bad about jatropha. <br><br>Jatropha, a bushy shrub that grows in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia is touted as a ‘miracle’ biofuel because its seeds contain a potentially-valuable, non- edible vegetable oil that can be used for biodiesel. <br><br>The controversy surrounding jatroha is fueled on the experiences of countries like India, in Africa and in Southeast Asia, the question being: “Is jatropha really a miracle plant that will solve world-wide hunger and poverty?” <br><br>The arguments around jatropha fall into several distinct categories. First, the land-use debate: can it actually be grown on marginal land? Should valuable land be used for food, or fuel? And how should land be partitioned, both nationally and at village level? <br><br>Second, the water and forests on that land: how does one calculate their actual economic, social, cultural, ecological and projected value, and to whom? Locals or investors? <br><br>About 95 percent of the articles I read in the Internet are against the mass production of jatropha because the claims of its proponents have not proved to be true. <br><br>From the Manila Bulletin (Jan 29/10) titled Jatropha too good to be true: To its fans, jatropha is a miracle crop, an eco-friendly answer to India’s growing energy needs, but some experts are starting to question whether the wonder-shrub is too good to be true. The seeds of the wild plant, which grows abundantly across India, produce non-edible oil that can be blended with diesel to make the biofuel that is part of government efforts to cut carbon emissions and combat climate change. That, combined with the shrub’s much-vaunted ability to flourish on poorly-irrigated land should make it the perfect crop for wasteland in the drought-prone nation. But new research shows jatropha, which has received huge government backing in recent years, yields less than experts had first predicted, and is now being grown on fertile farmland -– undermining two of its best selling points. <br><br>“Jatropha is being talked of as a crop that will grow on marginal an uncultivated land, and which will not compete with mainstream cultivation,’ said Sharachchandra Lele, a senior fellow at ATree, an Indian environmental research group promoting sustainable development. “But this is not what is happening in practice. Some state governments are promoting its cultivation on regular agricultural land where it will displace existing crops including food crops,” said Lele. “We are basically subsidizing the urban elite’s petrol consumption at the cost of rural livelihoods and food production.” <br><br>Andrew Wasley of Ecologist (March 30/1010) writes:  “UK fund managers are selling investments in jatropha plantations as a wallet-swelling, planet-saving financial bonanza. But the reality for poor farmers is very different… A number of UK-based investment companies are marketing a controversial biofuel crop as an ‘ethical investment’ despite it being linked to conflicts over land, food security, and growing hunger in developing countries.” <br><br>The investment companies are selling jatropha as the new ‘green oil’ and claim it has the potential to alleviate poverty and improve livelihoods in developing countries. <br><br>One of the plants’ biggest benefits, the companies claim, is that it thrives on low-grade marginal land, and in semi-arid areas with poor soils, thus, not competing with food production. <br><br>But according to campaigners, the supposed benefits of jatropha are largely unproven, and the experiences of many farmers encouraged to plant the crop do not tally with the claims of the biofuel industry or its investors. <br><br>Yields have fallen short of predictions, say farmers, and good agricultural land has been given over to jatropha, threatening food security. Promised incomes have also failed to materialise, it is claimed, because of poor demand for jatropha seeds. <br><br>The Ecologist’s findings come as a new report by ActionAid links the expansion of industrial biofuels, derived from crops including jatropha, palm oil, soya and sugar cane, to rising food prices and increasing global hunger. <br><br>Meredith Alexander, head of trade and corporates at ActionAid, told the Ecologist: “ActionAid deals with the harsh realities of a billion people going hungry now, and the threat that climate change will make matters even worse. Like snake oil salesmen of old, propagandists for jatropha oil have a list of miraculous claims a mile long, but no matter what they say, jatropha is not a solution to climate change, and actually makes hunger worse.’” <br><br>Friends of the Earth’s Kenneth Richter, said: ‘The positive spin about jatropha made by investment companies doesn’t marry up with the experiences of farmers growing the crop. This so-called biofuel wonder crop is failing farmers, and failing the environment. Companies should stop investing in jatropha until they have properly assessed its social and environmental impact.’ <br><br>In an article titled Jatropha biofuels: the true cost to Tanzania, Jo Anderson, a Tanzanian environmental consultant, wrote: “There’s a lot of theory about jatropha. Despite acres of scientific research, there’s no evidence of it working on a large scale at all. It’s driven by the industrialized countries’ and donors’ need to find potential fuel to mitigate against environmental problems: it’s sold as a plant that grows anywhere: on degraded land, as a hedgerow...Any poor farmer can just put it in, and get rich. But jatropha doesn’t grow on the commercial industrial scale needed to run biodiesel plants: the transaction costs of large scale don’t add up. On a small scale, say 500 villages, you could produce the oil for this village to cook on, but not enough to run it at the size the investors need.’” <br><br>From Kenya: “A key question is whether jatropha really is as hardy and durable as its supporters claim. Geoffrey Howard of the International Union of Conservation of Nature says, ‘Because jatropha is used locally on graves by East Africans, we assume it’s indigenous. It’s not. Jatopha is essentially an invasive species. It is thirsty, needs irrigation, and in no studies has it met the expectations of projected yields, either in terms of fruit or oil produced.” <br><br>From Zaheerabad, India, Andhra Pradesh (IPS/IFEJ) wrote: “Our experimentation with jatropha shows us that it is unsuitable for Indian small farmers due to its need for watering, manuring, and its long gestation period,” says Srinivas Ghatty of Tree Oils. Raju Sona, another farmer said: ‘No one will buy jatropha. People said if you have a plantation then surely, you have a good market, but we didn’t see such good market. When I got the message that there was no market, I got discouraged. I felt very bad. I expected profit. I threw [the seeds] away. They were no use to me. I destroyed the plants because of lack of market. The thing is that we have land, but if I use it for jatropha and I don’t get good production after spending money, it will be a great loss for me. <br><br>But that area too is hazy, and not just in India. The spacing, height, and pruning needed for commercialized jatropha bushes do not give sufficient density or biomass for effective sequestration. <br><br>In Senegal and Swaziland, evidence suggests the plant will only survive with irrigation systems, contradicting industry claims that jatropha grows well with limited water usage.<br> <br>In (India’s) Rajasthan’s Udaipur district, farmers became hostile to jatropha after seeing their cattle die from eating the toxic leaves of the plant. ’’We were encouraged to grow jatropha by agents who sold us saplings at Rs 10 (US 5 cents) each and extolled the virtues of jatropha,’’ Sukh Ram, a farmer, told IPS. ‘’We were told that jatropha, being unpalatable to cattle, the saplings would stay safe. But no one told us what would happen to the cattle. In the end, we not only lost what we paid for the saplings but also possible earnings from three hectares of land, three years in a row. We are not prepared to take such risks again.’’ <br><br>A reader of the Economist reacted: “I have worked in an area in West Africa where two trial plots of 20 hectares each were planted with jatropha, as the land was not considered suitable for the crop they wished to grow. After one year, they had harvested approximateliy one wheelbarrow full from 40 hectares, and had learnt that the crop needed a lot of water, and did not do well on poor land. In general, it is nonsense to suggest the crop would not detract from food growing as it is bound to use the same allocation of land. It would also be used as yet another monocrop which is quite quickly killing off our Worlds biodiversity. All monocropping is destructive creating ‘living’ deserts. <br><br>A FENOr member emailed: “From the point of view of someone who desires to have sustainable agriculture for our continued survival on this planet, I would say that indeed, large scale production of jatropha, especially in mountainous areas which should be best for centennial trees of varied species, is hazardous to the environment. We should need deep-rooted trees to be planted in the mountains to let water seep into the soil and form part of dwindling water deposits. In organic farming, we discourage the use of oil-based fertilizer because of its bad effects on the fertility of soil. It follows then that oil- producing jatropha planted in large scale is not beneficial to soil enrichment because of the heavy oil content. We certainly can live without oil but we cannot live without food.” <br><br>And for the children, this article by Sujeet Kumar titled Jatropha harmful for kids, soil, and aquatic life. “According to author Panaj Oudhia, a Raipur-based agricultural scientist, jatropha plant can harm the soil and aquatic life, cause skin cancer, and even affect the brain of children if accidentally consumed. Researchers found in 1987 that jatropha oil contains tumor-promoting substances. People across the world know that jatropha oil is harmful for the skin. This is the reason why it is also known as ‘Hell oil’,” said Oudhia. <br><br>According to Oudhia, the plant has negative effects on the soil, flora and fauna as well. “Jatropha is a poisonous weed and is harmful for soil, especially in the case of monoculture. Research has shown that jatropha has harmful effects on Indian crops. Jatropha monoculture is considered a future natural disaster by environmentalists.” <br><br>The scientist said that planting jatropha near water sources is also hazardous for indigenous fish species. And yet, as one author puts it, “jatropha cannot be thrown out along with the bathwater in India.” Some say it will work. It was shown that organic manuring, average watering, and interspersing jatropha with nitrogen-fixing crops produce the best results for both jatropha and the soils.  And in many cases, it is government policy and people who are to blame, rather than jatropha itself.  Jatropha proponents claim that if well-managed, jatropha and other biofuel crops can work. <br><br>Viren Lobo, director for the Society for Promotion of Wastelands, a government-funded organisation based in New Delhi, says jatropha plantations need to incorporate “questions of livelihood, food, fodder, energy, and biodiversity security.’’ <br><br>My take on this issue? It’s an important subject that should be studied, discussed, debated on, and resolved. Anybody from University Town who is willing to start the ball rolling? <br>",

Victor “Dean” Sinco,  and it was there that I found him one morning last week, surrounded by Apple Computer equipment and monitors of various sizes, playing with his latest toy,  the Apple Ipad. “This is really cool,” he told me, handing it to me, “it’s going to change everything in education”.<BR><BR>What I held in my hand was  a bright screen playing an HD movie, in an object made of glass and polished aluminum,  about the size of a sheet of ordinary paper and about one half inch thick. “It weighs less than a pound,” said Dean, “and it can hold a ton of books, and photos, and maps, and anything else— Email, internet downloads;  plus, it’ll run for ten hours on one charge. And it’s cheap! –About $500 U.S.- over a year,  that’s about 75 Pesos  a day; over five years, about 15 Pesos a day! That’s about the same as one of those no-brand laptops that die on you in a couple of months- and this is an Apple product!<BR><BR>“Well,” I said, “it’s a pretty amazing machine, but how can it ‘revolutionize education’ ? “Well,” he said, “think about being able to carry a whole library around with you, inside something you can hold and read like a book, at home, in bed, anywhere. We’re digitizing our entire library here at F.U., and our students and staff will be able to download anything from there through our on-campus wi-fi. Also we have a lot of educational videos on line available for them, plus chat rooms can be set up to take the place of assignment books -- and maybe even some academic counseling.”<BR><BR>“Then”,  he went on , “look at all the books out of  copyright- anything written before 1935- all available for download without royalty. That’s law books, medical books, practically free. The cost of the Ipad is nothing compared to the cost of books like that if you have to buy them. And then there will be  free downloads of books from university libraries all over the world. ” <BR><BR>“Knowing you”, I said, “I’m sure you’ve come to some grand philosophical conclusion from all this.” He laughed. “Well, yes”, he said, “This technology means that anyone in the world can read and learn anything. So learning won’t be  restricted to people in big cities in major countries. People from, say, Dumaguete, will now be able to compete in knowledge with people in New York and Berlin and Paris. It’s the globalization of  knowledge- that’s pretty significant, don’t you think?”<BR><BR>“I’m sure it is”, I said, “my question is, how do you  get one of these things”? “I snuck a few of them in ahead”, he said, “but they’ll be generally available here in July.” <BR><BR>“ We really want to encourage our students and staff to sign on to this technology, so we’re planning to raffle ten Ipads to our students, and hope that others will follow when they see what they can do with this thing.” “Count me in,” I said.  “Sorry,” he said, you’re not an F.U. student. You’ll have to buy one”.<BR>",

   "body": "DUMAGUETE CITY--An interesting legal showdown is in the offing over who would sit as governor of Negros Oriental starting June 30, when all newly-elected public officials assume office. {{more}}<BR><BR>There are lawyers who think that the next governor would be vice-governor-elect Agustin Perdices while the other opinion is that the next governor will have to be chosen through a special election.<BR><BR>For Dean Mikhail Lee Maxino of the Silliman University College of Law, this is a very novel legal issue because there is yet no legal jurisprudence that squarely addresses this case. \"The Local Government Code does not use those terms used in the Constitution in referring to the death or incapacity of the President-elect or the Vice President-elect. Rather, the LGC uses the term 'elective'--not 'elected'--local officials.\"<BR><BR>\"If you strictly understand the word elective, it refers to the office of governor, vice governor, etc. It assumes that there should be someone there who took an oath of office and something happened to him. The line of succession will not kick in if the governor-elect was unable to take his oath because there's nobody in that office to be succeeded.\"<BR><BR>Maxino said at the time the vacancy occurred, Vice-Governor-elect Agustin Perdices was still not the Vice Governor. <BR><BR>For Regional Court Administrator Rafael Cresencio Tan, there may be a need for a special election. \"I will have to study the Local Government Code but there is an opinion by some lawyers and judges that the Comelec will have to issue a special resolution calling for a special election. But this would depend on whether the Comelec would call for it. He said the likely scenario, should his opinion be given weight, is that Perdices will take his oath as Vice Governor on June 30 and then take an oath as Acting Governor. The other elected officials will also take a second oath as acting officials for posts one rank higher.<BR><BR>While admitting that there are lawyers with different opinions, Rep. George Arnaiz said the next Governor would be Perdices. \"It's very simple -- there's no reason for him to be acting governor if there's no governor to be sworn in. There's already a law that provides for it. When there's a vacancy existing in the office of the governor, the vice governor takes over. It doesn't matter whether the governor-elect was able to take his oath or not because if he is able to take his oath and he dies, the same law will apply.\"<BR><BR>MCTC Judge Antonio Alcantara, meanwhile, said the vice governor-elect will move up and assume the governorship, bringing up all the other elected officials one rank higher.  \"They will have to take two oaths of office on June 30--one for the position that they ran for and won and the other will be for the next higher position,\" Alcantara said.<BR><BR>Provincial Election Supervisor Atty. Eddie Aba said that the new governor of Negros Oriental on June 30 will be Vice-Governor-elect Agustin Perdices and Provincial Board Member Roel Degamo as the new Vice Governor. This is because of the provision on vacancies and succession as outlined in the Local Government Code of 1991 and subsequent vacancies will the Sangguniang Panlalawigan shall be filled automatically by the other sangguniang members according to their ranking.<BR><BR>Baldado, meanwhile, had earlier filed a petition before the Commission on Elections shortly after the elections seeking to disqualify Gov. Emilio Macias II from running for re-election on account of his health. The petition is now pending with the Comelec. If the Comelec agrees to disqualify Macias even after his proclamation, that would make Baldado as the governor-elect.<BR>",

PVO is targeting to vaccinate 80 percent of the total dog population in the province. <BR><BR>Records show that dog vaccination accomplishment in the Province has been low in the past years. Last year only 57 percent of the target was achieved. <BR><BR>Mutia said that the mass vaccination of dogs plays a large role in eradicating the deadly virus. <BR><BR>The highest dog vaccination that the province achieved in a year was at 77 percent, and the year after that, there were no rabies cases recorded here. <BR><BR>Human casualties due to rabid dog bites would be avoided if only all dogs have been vaccinated against the disease, stressed Mutia. <BR><BR>The provincial veterinarian is hopeful that things will look better this year in terms of dog vaccination after free dog vaccines were issued by the Department of Health courtesy of the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation. <BR><BR>Visayas has been chosen as one of the demo project sites for the project grant from said foundation which aims to demonstrate the feasibility of controlling and eliminating human rabies in low-income countries through the control and elimination of rabidogs.

   "body": "{{more}}<BR>In a Kapihan forum last week, the provincial coordinator of the Office of Civil Defense, Allen Cabaron, lamented the lack of interest among many heads of local government units in Negros Oriental to set up a disaster risk reduction and management plan, or allocate a budget for it. <BR><BR>\"There is not enough enthusiasm,\" Cabaron said.<BR><BR>This may explain why when disasters strike, we still have many victims or deaths. The Philippines ranks 8th in the mortality risk index of 222 countries. As an interesting footnote, it appears that the faces that you see at the evacuation centers in Negros Oriental whenever the floods come are the same faces that keep coming back year after year. No one seemed to learn a lesson here.<BR><BR>Compare our damage reports with the Province of Albay and you'll be in for a big surprise. Albay, which is the doormat of almost every typhoon to hit the country, has a very effective disaster risk reduction program which even won an international award. <BR><BR>\"Mitigation of risks is a duty...it is an exercise of political will,\" Salceda said in a recent forum with environmental journalists in Manila.<BR><BR>The secret of an effective disaster mitigation program is in social preparation. \"It's as normal as brushing one's teeth. In Albay, when rains fall, people automatically bring out their disaster preparedness kits.\" <BR><BR>In Metro Manila, at the height of Typhoon Ondoy, people went up their roofs without flashlights, water or food. \"People should know how to act whenever disaster strikes. Drivers, for instance, should not force their cars across flooded streets,\" Salceda said. Indeed, disaster risk management is no rocket science. It's so reasonable and it's science-based. <BR><BR>So why is this program getting a cold shoulder from many mayors, not just in the province but throughout the country?<BR><BR>\"Wala silang makukuha, eh!\" Salceda said. <BR><BR><BR><BR>",

But is this move enough?  We hope that the next administration realizes that the intensity of the last 2 big floods when the river banks overflowed also brought down a lot of garbage first of all from the city’s problematic dumpsite as well as the informal dumps that are strewn all over the city in most of the barangays.  There is a lot of uncollected garbage around mainly because many people mostly in depressed areas aren’t bothering.  During big floods these garbage will also find their way into the canals and clog them up.<br><br>We all have work ahead of us esp. in the barangay level.  A strengthened Environmental and Natural Resources Office (ENRO), a decent budget for programs to reach out to the people, in short a Comprehensive Plan on Solid Waste Management.   City Hall should also ask itself how  segregation of garbage works in their own turf.    <br><br>There can be an economic boom, the city can be attracting dozens of new businesses, more shiny cars can be seen but as long as our waste management is way below par, quality of life in this city drops.<br><br><b>Esther Windler<br>Friends of the Environment, Negros Or.

   "body": "<i>(Open letter to Mr. Abednego Gerona, Municipal Agrarian Officer, Siaton, Negros Oriental) {{more}}</i><br><br><b>Dear Mr. Gerona:</b><br><br>We are appealing to you and your office to help in promoting awareness of the Coastal Resource Management Program of our municipality here in Barangay Siit, particularly the nearshore area from Andulay to Antulang, where the coral reef has a  chance to recover. We understand that the municipal police force can only give security support to the DA personnel, and the police officers who attended to our plea last night insisted that it is mainly the DA office who has a working strategy and can enforce the fishery laws. Perhaps with a coordinated strategy, our cooperative work can have measurable results.<br><br>We in Antulang often feel unsupported as in our place, the police often state, is too distant from the Siaton Police Station for any real apprehension to take place. As every illegal fishing acitivity has to be “caught-in-the-act”, and wherein the municipal ordinance, as you have explained, has to have the presence of the DA, the police, and the local barangay officer, our local Bantay Dagat volunteer work  in restoring our marine resources is becoming weak.  This policy makes the law almost impossible to enforce, and we can only make this step to have our report with photos and videos investigated. Kindly make an official written reply as this can clarify what your proposal can do to raise an appeal for our barangay needs without having to go through a cycle of referrals  to the Phil. Navy, the  mun. police, the mayor, and the governor.<br><br>Based on one report (attached), kindly facilitate a prompt investigation so our reef here in Siit can have a chance against constant abuse from our community members. We have often reported this to our local barangay, and these same violators have been already caught in the act by Bry. Captain Bondocan,  who was  together with the barangay officers. Despite of this, these same people have not stopped, and worse, they are getting bolder in showing how they violate our right to have a healthy reef. All life requires clean water and clean air, and no man, city, and country on this planet has the right to contribute in this unsustainable way of fishing. Major and minor offenses continue as such abuses do not get any sanction. Our resources are very limited, and we still have no Bantay Dagat in this area, who, according to the police officer last night, that we should just refer these problems to the barangay level. <br><br>As you may know, any volunteer work for our CRM can only work if the  agencies tasked to orient the people of conservation efforts and where the  law gets enforced go hand-in-hand. Without it everything else become redundant. We strongly believe in protecting our fishery as this is the main sustenance for food and basic livelihood of our local people. It is in the same vein of environmental stewardship that we hope on that we can work together.<br><br>Please help us.<br><br>Very truly yours,<br><br><b>GENA MARI R.

   "body": "<div><br></div><div><br></div><br>I discovered that nothing compares with a freshman’s youthful eagerness as an ingredient if one wants to discover what a University has to offer.  <br><br>I remember entering my first class—which I was most enthusiastic about—English Essay Composition 101.  The professor, a golden-brown-skinned lady who moved like a ballerina, enthusiastically instructed us, “Write an essay entitled, ‘How to Kill a Cat!’    It must be at least three paragraphs;  must be creative, fresh and realistic!” <br><br>I was baffled!  And surprised at such a welcome.  I gave my best nevertheless, though it was much struggle to put into words such a bloody event.  Because I was so imaginative, the cadaver smelled pungently in my thoughts and  I caught myself covering my nose. <br><br>I was 17 then, but already resolved that there is nothing good to learn about death. Until <i>HINILAWOD</i> was staged!  <br><br><i>Hinilawod</i> gave birth in me a realization of the countless times a Filipino was killed.<br><br>So, how do we kill a Filipino?  I reviewed. <br><br><b>1.  Let a foreign hand write his history.</b><br><br>Do not awaken a Filipino to study himself:  his heritage, his culture, his ancestors.  Convince him that history is trivial and boring.  Once he loses interest in his past, he will entrust the writing of it to another hand.<br><br>And the killing may begin.  <br>For he will look at his past in shame.  For how can a foreign hand write the past of another race with such intensity of pride and love?  Much more, how can a colonizer write the history of the colonized with much dignity and esteem of the latter’s own heritage and culture?<br><br>So, a Filipino will eventually embrace the foreigner’s description of us, the moment they reached our shores: <i>“Each man does whatever he pleases, and takes care only of himself….  No person favors another, unless it is for his own interest….  They recognize neither lord nor rule.… When they meet one another in the open fields at nightfall, they rob and seize one another...they have no order or arrangement in anything.”<br></i><br>Even it wasn’t what it was!  We had order.  We had a system of governance. We had kingdoms and we had our sense of territory. Our rulers were highly revered.  We had a system of ‘alliance’ between tribes, between communities.  We already possessed the art of warfare tactics and strategy.<br> <br>The Spanish historian Pedro Chirino, himself, said of us: <i>“All these islanders are given to writing and there is scarcely anybody who cannot read and write…”</i><br><br><i>(But let the Filipino believe otherwise…)</i><br><br>It wasn’t what it was!  We had our own writing.  We had our own language.  Anthropologists were able to dig jars with ancient Filipino writings which revealed love letters in poetry.  We had our own literature which expressed our innermost sentiments.<br><br>The Laguna Copperplate Inscription bore our ancient alphabet which was a mix of four languages: <i>Sanskrit, Old Tagalog, Old Javanese</i>, and <i>Old Malay</i>.  This first Filipino writing artifact “re-dated” our history to be long before the Spanish arrived.  And that is 621 years earlier than the previously accepted date of 1521 by Antonio Pigafetta! <br><br><i>(But let the Filipino believe otherwise…)</i><br><br>It wasn’t what it was!  <br>We were not savages.  We were not lacking in civilization.<br>Our history was “mis-written”.  We were “mis-described”. <br><br><i>(But let the Filipino believe otherwise…)</i><br><br>This is how to kill a Filipino.  <br>His lack of understanding of his past will kill him—because it will never lead him into knowing who he really is.  By then, you may call him, “barbarian”, “slave” or “inferior race”—he will not mind.  He might even meekly accept that you are right.   <br><br><br><b>2. Tamper his understanding of culture: make it uninformative, but, rather comparative.</b><br><br>Make him disregard the beauty of the Banawe Rice Terraces—how with such sharp accuracy the structure was built: The perfect irrigation system, the genius seen in the planting strategy, the soil formation!   If you are to teach him to study his past, do so in such a way that you deaden the potential of his land and his DNA.  <br><br>Teach him a song and let it echo beginning in his tender years, <br><i>“Planting rice is never fun. <br>Bent from morning till the set of sun.  <br>Cannot stand and cannot sit.  <br>Cannot rest for a little bit!”  </i><br><br>Teach him in such a way that you corrupt his understanding of  dignified work.<br><br>When he begins to look into his culture with the mindset that he is inferior, he will ultimately disregard the hard work of his ancestors.  And this will kill him.  This will kill <i>in</i> him the great revelation of how his ancestors brilliantly responded to the necessities of their time.<br><br>Rob him of love for his race and the value of his land.  <br>This is how to kill a Filipino.<br>Teach him to hate who he is by hating the land of his birth, and the ancestors who toiled in the land. <br><br><br><b>3.  Convince him to pamper his sons. </b><br>Do not make a warrior of his young men.  Tell him that to love them is to shield them from pain, discomfort and difficulty.  Teach him to sweetly spoil his son—spare the rod and give in to the cries of a little child.  Teach him how to smother his son with kisses in public.  Then, watch how his young son will grow up mocking discipline and rejecting rebuke from his elders.  <br><br>Afterwards, persuade him that to prize a male is to redeem him from the dirty hands of hard work. Do this, so that his son will never learn to bend his back in toil and, thus, rather than serve, will seek instead to be served.<br><br>To pamper his son is to deprive him of workers and protectors of the land.  This is how to kill a Filipino.  For it shall be easy for you to be a tyrant in a land where the men are weak—where lands can be snatched and women can be bought.<br><br><br><div><b>4.  Influence his daughters with nothing but vanity.</b><br>Veer the women away from education and thinking.  Encourage them to focus on appearance.  And confuse them intensely by distorting their understanding of beauty:  it’s the white skin, the sharp pointed nose—and all that is contrary to how God created her race.  Make her consumed by her external appearance so that she may be distracted from the essentials—the building of character and the training of the mind!  <br><br>Watch his daughters dislike learning.  And their ignorance and gullibility will give you power over their very thoughts.  You can now dictate!  You may do so as frivolously  or as rigid as you want to be.  Anyway, his daughters will neither mind nor wonder.  You are now in control.<br><br><br><b>5.  Keep him from seeing his own epic come alive!</b><br><i>Hinilawod</i> represents a masterpiece of our own literature!  It mirrors our value system as it imparts to us the true “spirit of a Filipino”.  Thus, this play opens our eyes to the countless times the Filipinos were killed.  It awakens us by reminding us that we were made to think small of ourselves—contrary to the way our ancestors carried themselves and lived their lives.  <br><br><b>By popular demand, </b><i><b>HINILAWOD</b></i><b> will be shown on July 1, 2 and 3 at 8:00pm, LUCE Auditorium.</b> <br><br>Hinilawod is not just an epic.  It is <b>our epic</b>.  The beauty of our past is revealed in Hinilawod: the courage of our men who were willing to scale the heights of adversity, the strength of our women who stood for what they believed in,  our respect for our elders, our seeking of deeper things—of life’s purpose and mission and of spiritual truths.<br><br><i>Hinilawod</i> cries for us.  It calls out on us that we must dig away the mentality that we are small, that we are inferior.  Our ancestors were never lacking in wisdom in responding to the challenges of our land.  Our ancestors were not spared from much difficulty but they had risen from it—we must learn from them and dare continue what they began. Only after all these can we begin to look and, eventually, move forward. Only after all these can the killing of the Filipino be stopped!   (Charity Oh)<br><br></div>",

Another environment friendly ordinance approved for the third and final reading was the Smoking Prohibition Ordinance of Negros Oriental.<BR><BR>Reading Will’s email, I jumped off my seat and did a jig that would put to shame the antics of the FIFA football spectators watching the games being played in South Africa. What especially made me extremely happy was the information that the ordinance to transform Negros Oriental into a smoke-free province—the first to do so, is approved for final reading. Bernie Maniego, health director of Framework Convention Alliance on Tobacco Free Philippines, said Negros Oriental is the first province to create a local ordinance promoting a smoke-free province. I hope that Acting Governor Petit Baldado will get to sign this ordinance, authored by Provincial Board Member Marcelo Adanza (Mabuhay ka Honorable Adanza!), before June 30.<BR>What makes the smoke-free ordinance timely is the news I saw on TV recently featuring members of the LTFRB and DOH Secretary Ezperanza Cabral posting “NOSI” (No Sigarilyo) stickers on public transport vehicles. This move of the LTFRB and DOH is in consonance with RA 9211 or the Tobacco Regulation Act of the Philippines.<BR><BR>Another noteworthy development in the implementation of RA9211 is a two-year experiment initiated by the Metro Manila Development Authority to make Metro Manila (composed of 17 cities and municipalities) a smoke free region by 2012, starting July 1, 2010 to June 20, 2012. The project, entitled \"Enforcement of a 100% Smoke Free Environment Policy in Metro Manila\" is financed through a P9.5-million grant from New York-based Bloomberg Philantrophies, endorsed by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, a non-profit scientific organization promoting lung health based in France. Bloomberg is an umbrella charity organization managed by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. (Mayor Chiquiting Sagarbarria should perhaps get in touch with his counterpart in NYC and apply for a similar grant).<BR><BR>The two-year program is in accordance with the Memorandum Circular No. 17, Series of 2009 issued by the Civil Service Commission that prohibits smoking in government premises. Under the memorandum, those caught will be given a stern warning on first offense; faces suspension and dismissal from service for the second and third offences.<BR><BR>Negros Oriental will soon be the first province to be smoke-free. “Basta NEGOR, DO MORE.” Para laging may HONOR.  <BR><BR>oOo<BR><BR>Yesterday, I facilitated a planning workshop for the physical education faculty, coaches and staff of the FU Institute of Youth Sports for Peace (IYSPeace). I would like to share with others our planning guidelines.<BR><BR>The theme: “Don't Try. Do.”  We chose this theme to denote our commitment to achieve our goal. There is no such thing as “try.” You either do it, or you don’t. The other guidelines are:<BR><BR> _. We compete. To survive. To excel.<BR> _. Limit your objectives to three. More than three objectives is no objective.<BR> _. In pursuing your objectives, keep in mind that you work with people; they are human beings. Keep your humanity and preserve theirs.<BR> _. You can’t teach or lead without self-confidence. If you don’t have this, don’t waste your time and ours. Resign immediately.<BR> _. Always be humble. Know the differences among humility, timidity and cowardice.<BR> _. Be punctual. Meet deadlines. Defaulting time is 15 minutes.<BR> _. Don’t say “I tried my best” as an excuse for failure. No one tries his worst.<BR> _. Respect the hierarchy of authority. There’s a God in Heaven and presidents on Earth. A Dr. Mira D. Sinco…and you.<BR> <BR>We, at Foundation University, mourn the passing of Governor Dr. Emilio C. Macias II. We displayed a tarpaulin at the Capitol grounds showing him participating in our various activities, with the caption: “Thank you Governor Dodo Macias for sharing yourself with us.” <BR><BR>One thing I remember about him is he listens to you when you talk, he doesn’t interrupt you when you are talking, and he was always gracious, never pompous. I wanted him so much to host the Palarong Pampansa and hoped that he would in 2013 when the school games will be staged in the Visayas.  Perhaps, come that year, the Palaro will be held here and we will celebrate the games in his honor. <BR>",

   "body": "<BR>DAVAO CITY -- Every new year, I promise to myself that this year — this year! — I’m going to get healthy and lose weight. As with other resolutions, that promise gets tossed aside and forgotten, lost among the piles of cupcake doilies and empty Coke bottles.  <BR><BR>Oh, it wasn’t for any lack of trying: I enrolled in the gym, I got back to biking, I jogged in the mornings, but it all came to naught.  My weight blew up to close to 200 lbs. <BR><BR>I tried to chalk it up to my being, you know, big- boned, but at some point, I just had to admit when I looked in the mirror that I was...fat. <BR><BR>Well, not anymore, or at least not as much.  Over the past three months, I’ve shed more than 10 pounds, and trimmed a couple of inches from my waistline.  I no longer look like a suman in my shirts.  Pants, for which I had to suck my gut in before, fit comfortably now, and soon, I may have to buy a new belt.  <BR><BR>Friends whom I have not met in a while compliment me on how much better I look when we see each other.  I feel healthier, I haven’t been sick in months, and on the whole, I just feel better.  And I owe it all to...diet and exercise. <BR><BR>Oh, I’m sorry.  Were you expecting me to peddle a magic pill? Yes, there are those, but I chose to lose my weight the traditional way. <BR><BR>I’ll admit, though, that I had a bit of high-tech help, and this came by way of my Wii.  <BR><BR>Now, in case you’ve never heard of it, the Wii is a gaming console from Nintendo, the same company that brought you Mario Bros. The Wii’s innovation is its wireless motion-sensitive remote (the Wii-mote) and Nintendo offers a variety of sports action video games that actually require you to move. <BR><BR>Based on a friend’s recommendation, I bought a Wii Fit accessory.  The Wii Fit consists of a balance board and exercise software. The balance board detects shifts in your position based on your weight; it also doubles as a very accurate weighing scale.  <BR><BR>The software, on the other hand, features yoga, strength training, and aerobics exercises.  Perhaps the most valuable service the Wii Fit performs, though, is the daily record of your weight loss (or gain): it’s so sensitive it detects changes of half-a-pound.  So yes, it will know if you had the extra serving of ice cream from last night. <BR><BR>If all this sounds wonderful, it is.  But still, it’s no magic pill.  For the Wii Fit to be effective, you actually still have to get on the Wii-Fit and get moving.  I confess I bought the Wii-Fit over a year ago, but only in the last few months did I really take it seriously.  Only in the last few months did I also get fit. <BR><BR>At a combined price of P19,000 (P13,000 for the Wii, P6,000 for the Wii Fit), the whole package sounds pricey.  But consider that it’s about the cost of a decent bike, or a year’s membership in a high-end gym. I tried both alternatives before, but they didn’t take: I had a serious biking accident in Samal last year, one shredded my left hand to hamburger, and required stitches on my knee and both sides of my head; and the gym, after a while, feels too clubby.  I think I prefer to exercise at home, away from judging eyes, and cap it off with a game or two of Mario Bros. after. <BR><BR>Besides, even with my bike and gym membership, I really didn’t lose weight. Come to think of it, I didn’t lose weight with the Wii Fit either.  Only when I altered my diet did I really start to notice the changes.  And the diet plan was simplicity itself: no softdrinks, and no rice. <BR><BR>It all makes sense, if you think about it.  Softdrinks are loaded with sugar, and a high-sugar diet converts those excess calories into fat.  <BR><BR>The same goes for rice.  In the past, I could drink up to a liter of Coke per day (sometimes more), and take a cup and a half of rice per meal. Now I’ve effectively forsworn carbonated drinks of any kind, substituting moderate amounts of calamansi juice and tea instead.  <BR><BR>At the start it was hard going: the body needs time to adjust to the new diet.  But eventually, I got used to it.  I eat so much less nowadays.  It boggles my mind how much I actually consumed before, versus how much the body really needs to get by.  <BR><BR>Heh, if we face another rice shortage, I can pretty much guarantee you it won’t be because of me. <BR><BR>Like I said, there’s no magic pill here.  I may have trimmed down, but I know I’m still overweight.  I still need a few months more, but slow and steady is the healthy way to go.  Diet and exercise: heh. Who knew? <BR>",

   "body": "<BR>Governor Emilio “Dodo” Macias III,  has passed away, and most of the people of Negros Oriental   grieved for the demise of a  “hands  on”, leader who had served in various public positions,  as a Con-con Delegate,     Sangguniang Panlalwigan Member,  Vice Governor, Deputy Minister of Health, Congressman and Governor.  Though, a politician by choice, he was a medical at heart having graduated  from the University  of the Philippines, College of Medicine. His wife, Dr. Melba Pandy Lopez, was his classmate and lifelong partner in their fruitful journey, blessed with six children, four of whom are doctors and  all of them, professionals,  in their own right. As fellow travellers in the journey of life, we are witnesses to each other struggles, successes and failures,   renewals and reflections, of the people  encountered  in this journey.<BR><BR> Dodo touched the lives of many of his loyal followers and constituents   in the different areas of the province.  In the 1980s, many will remember how he espoused the “one grid-one rate” policy, knocking at the doors of people whom he think could help him push through his vision of one rate for the region. While  Dodo Macias was well known because of the Macias name,  his personal crusade brought him to our doorstep. At this time, my husband, Atty. Francisco Dy Yap was the President of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines ( Negros  Oriental Chapter), and naturally,  my main  task  was to listen and make him comfortable in our living room. At the outset, he came through as a driven, headstrong,  and passionate  about his  vision.<BR><BR>Many years later,  the elections after EDSA ,  brought  my husband, Frank and myself to his doorstep, this time, we were among those who encouraged him to run for Governor.  Riding on the post-EDSA fervor,  we formed a loose coalition of  like minded individuals,  composed of: Glynda Descuatan, Dr. Joannie Dy Sycip, Moises Sycip, Gregorio Uymatiao, Jr., and Atty. Edwin Torres, the group was named the Citizens Movement for Good Government (CMGG).  He won as Governor, serving for three (3) terms. The campaign motto was: “Evil men flourish because good men do nothing!”;<BR><BR>After his election as Governor, he spearheaded the celebration of the 100th year  anniversary of the founding of the province,  in 1990, institutionalizing the Negros Oriental Centennial Commission, with Dr. Joannie Sycip as Chairperson, Glyda Descuatan as Vice-Chairperson, and  myself as the Secretary. It was at this point  that we closely worked with   Gov. Macias  and together, we exerted all efforts to put the best  image of the province to the nation and to the world.<BR><BR> Now, that  Dodo is now in his final resting place, he left  this world, as he always was,  vibrant, full of action and hopes for the future.  This is how my husband and myself remember Dodo:  meeting his  unmistakable vehicle  already on the roll at 5:00a.m.-  how the man loved his job and how he looked forward to each day, with the enthusiasm   and determination, that only Dodo as Dodo, can exude.<BR><BR>Our prayers and condolences  to Baba, and her children,  Dodo will surely be missed, but, they can rest in the consolation that  the memory of . Dodo   is kept alive in the hearts of many, who know and respect him, as a devoted family man  and public servant.<BR><BR>This  time, Dodo has reached his final resting place. May he rest in Peace!. <BR><BR>  <BR>              <BR>",

   "body": "<BR>CEBU CITY—Even  emperors must  shimmy  down  from limbs  they  clamber  on. Thus, Gen Delfin  Bangit -- dubbed as “Emperor of the  Intelligence Service” --  didn’t wait to be canned  when  Benigno  Aquino III  becomes president.  He quit. <BR><BR>But  first, he balked. He’d stay  on as Armed  Forces chief of staff until July 2011. Why? President  Gloria Macapagal Arroyo  stipulated  that he serve until turning  56, the mandatory retirement  age. The “Emperor’s” term would overrun by  11 months Arroyo’s  own departure from Malacanang noon of  June 30. <BR><BR>In so doing,  Arroyo stomped  on  the  incoming President’s prerogatives. <BR><BR>Aquino would  have none of it. “I’ll  appoint my own chief of  staff,”  he declared. <BR><BR>This  was only the  latest appointment  that Arroyo  tried to corral at quarter-of- midnight.  She appointed scores to the judiciary, Pagcor, government corporations, even Luneta Park. Her spokesmen shoveled  unsolicited  advice  : from Aquino  taking his oath before  the Arroyo’s  Supreme Court’s chief justice  to retaining midnight appointees. <BR><BR>Bangit  morphed willy-nilly into a  high-profile exhibit of  Arroyo “sowing the dragon’s teeth”.  The phrase means  systematic fomenting of disputes. In Greek mythology, Jason sowed  teeth of   the dragon slain at the spring of Arbes. And  from  them   rose warriors to do battle for Jason. <BR><BR>Arroyo’s   “dragon teeth” stud  the  bureaucracy -- until pulled.  “The right to appoint carries with  it the right  to dismiss,” Aquino’s spokesman  says.  Who will fight  for Arroyo and family in tomorrow’s  brawls? <BR><BR>Not Bangit.  “The Chief of Staff serves at the pleasure of the President,” his spokesman said.  Bangit started  farewell visits, beginning  with  the 2nd Infantry Division in Rizal. Paalam,  Adios.  Sayonara. Arrivederci. Auf  weidersehen. <BR><BR> How  to  Say Goodbye with Class”  is not part  of  PMA’s curriculum. But  The Art of War by Sun Tzu  is: “The  general who advances without coveting fame, and retreats without fearing disgrace,  whose only thought is to protect his country and do good for sovereign is the jewel of the kingdom,”wrote  this Chinese sage (500-320 BC). <BR><BR>That  axiom  reflects realities here. Aquino has  the clout. He  won the elections by a landslide.  Asean, the European Union,  the US, and most countries recognize his mandate <BR><BR>More  basic, Filipinos resisted calls for extra- constitutional measures like coups. That   strengthens constitutional values such as civilian control over the military. <BR><BR>Issues of  legitimacy dogged  Gloria  Macapagal Arroyo, in contrast.  For almost a decade, she buttressed her shaky  position by coddling  warlords, as in Maguindanao, and officers loyal to her. Often, that  meant shunting aside qualified officers <BR><BR>It  underscores  a pernicious  legacy  of the Marcos dictatorship,  the withering of professionalism in soldiers. <BR><BR>“President  Quezon established a corps of professional officers…to deny control of the nation’s arsenals, whether to nationalist lawyers from UP, or  corporate executives from Ateneo,” notes Closer than Brothers (Yale University). <BR><BR>Among   85 graduates of PMA  Class'71, five morphed into torturers, and six were murdered, writes Prof. Alfred McCoy. Gringo Honasan mounted seven coups against Corazon Aquino – “a world record of failures”. Panfilo Lacson is  a fugitive. <BR><BR>\"They were the ultimate creatures of martial law…Mindanao bonded and brutalized  these young officers, and they became the fist of the Marcos dictatorship.\" <BR><BR>Decades later,  politicized officers succeeded  where mutinous officers  flopped, Glenda  Gloria  wrote in We were Soldiers: Military Men in Politics and the Bureaucracy. They  seized power \"by getting appointed to important civilian posts and winning elections.\" <BR><BR>\"The military is a product of its own environment, even a reflection of it,” adds Gloria (who co-authored The Crescent Moon: Rebellion in Mindanao). <BR><BR>Appointment of officers in civilian posts is reflective of the rent-seeking character. <BR><BR>Many of us  share Bangit’s failure to head the old  parable: “Whenever  you’re invited… do not  choose the best seat,” the Galilean  counseled. “It may happen that someone more  important than you has been invited. And your host will say: ‘Please give him your place’. What a shame is yours when you go to the lowest seat. <BR><BR>Look  at Vice-President-elect  Jejomar Binay. He’s pressing  to be named  as Interior & Local Government secretary. That’s the “first and only choice”, insists   Binay’s spokesman. Binay  is sharper than the President-elect, his team brags. They shrug off unresolved sleaze charges as \"non-remittance of withholding taxes of Makati government employees to the BIR\". <BR><BR>Congressman-elect  Tomas arm-twisting.  “People admire my talents,” he says  without blushing. He’d  want to take over the National Economic Development Authority. <BR><BR>Osmeña  also  wants Aquino to name one of his councilors,  Nestor Archival, as Environment  & Natural Resources  secretary.  Both come from the most ecologically-stressed  of  136 cities, Cebu Daily News notes. <BR><BR>Aquino is  swamped  by people who “seek the first places at table”. <BR><BR>When invited, “go to the lowest seat,” the Galilean will come and say to you: ‘Friend, go up higher.’ And this will be a great honor for you…For whoever humbles himself will be exalted.” <BR><BR>The  new  President  must yank out the “dragon’s teeth” while  selecting  those  who, as Sun Tzu  taught, “advance without coveting fame, retreat without fearing disgrace… whose only thought is to protect his country and do good for  sovereign”. <BR>",

   "url": "dodo-macias-legacy-p145-98.htm",
   "body": "<BR>When Irma Pal of MetroPost asked me by text last Sunday what I consider Governor Emilio C. Macias II ’s legacy as a public official, I immediately replied that improvement of health services in the province of Negros Oriental was his contribution to the welfare of the people of this province . I think many will not disagree with me on this judgment.<BR><BR>But there is another aspect of Dodo’s life that is perhaps not well known to many people. This is his involvement in the dialogue on the environment of Negros Oriental. Unlike many other public officials who are unwilling or afraid to join the discussion on environmental issues and therefore silent on these things, Dodo Macias chose to confront controversial issues head on. The result was that such issues became matters of public debates participated in by concerned citizens.  This way, issues of public concern are given a wide hearing as expected in a democratic society. <BR><BR>It was my privilege to be an active discussant with Dodo, along with other concerned citizens, in environmental controversies on issues of environmental conservation versus development. For some of these issues, we often found ourselves in opposite positions. But despite our differences in views about such issues, we had remained friends. <BR><BR>I would like to recall at least a couple of examples to show that Dodo changed his mind about environmental issues if presented with good scientific evidence contrary to his own ideas. <BR><BR>The first example dates back to the mid-1980s when there was an attempt to build a road through the lowland rainforest from Sibulan to the small Lake Danao in the Twin Lakes area. If that road was constructed, hundreds of hectares of tropical rainforest would have been denuded, resulting in erosion, sedimentation and pollution of Lake Danao. I also pointed out to him that building that road would make the forest around the two lakes accessible to tree cutters and wildlife hunters, with destruction of biodiversity. Besides, the Hanay-hanay road had already provided access to legitimate visitors, and there was no need to build another road.  Dodo must have listened to my advice, and the road construction was stopped. <BR><BR>The other example occurred in the early 2000s when he was serving as a Congressman. What happened was that somebody in the Philippine National Oil Company must have lobbied with him to present a bill to Congress that would have sliced off more than 5,000 hectares of the 8,000+ hectare Balinsasayao Twin Lakes Natural Park to allow a mineral survey operation. What was strange is that the Department of Environment in Dumaguete had agreed to the proposed reduction! We at Silliman mounted a campaign to oppose the bill on certain grounds. First, the disturbance caused by mining would render the affected areas susceptible to erosion during times of heavy rainfall or during episodes of earthquakes. Second, the area of the Park is already too small for the many important species of biodiversity in the Park. These species would require a large forest area to ensure their long-term survival. The Park actually requires an area bigger than 8,000 hectares in order to serve the conservation requirements of the endemic species of biodiversity.  Third, Negros Island has lost the bulk of its rainforest except for the remaining 30,000 hectares, which included the Twin Lakes Natural Park. Dodo finally saw the merit of our stand not to reduce the original 8,000+ hectares. The Park now earns income from tourism partly because its original size has been maintained.<BR><BR>But the manner by which he communicated to me his final decision is certainly worthy of mention. We met in the old Manila domestic airport one early morning to catch the first Air Philippines flight to Dumaguete. He came to where I was sitting and told me in an apologetic manner that he had withdrawn his bill because he realized we were right. That was a kind gesture from a man with political authority to listen to good, scientific arguments why a piece of tropical rainforest in a province  with very little forest remnants, after being devastated by commercial loggers and illegal tree cutters, should not be subjected to development (mining) activities.<BR><BR>Governor Emilio C. Macias II is dead at a relatively active age of 76 years, but his good deeds live on to benefit the coming generations of Negrenses.    <BR>",

After the World Bank Central Visayas Regional Project phased out in December 1992, Governor Macias took me from CVRP as project manager for eight years to set up the Resource Management Division in February 1993, which has now evolved into the ENRD to undertake CBRM and other environment projects and activities province-wide.  That resulted in my being pirated by the World Bank in 1995 as consultant.  That started my career as environment consultant and advisor to the World Bank, USAID, UNEP, and Asian Development Bank for than 20 years.

His greatest legacy as governor and congressman was the utilization of community values and traditions such as cooperation, alayon, tinabangay, kurambos, etc. to promote development in Negros Oriental.  This is evident in his award-winning initiatives like the community hospital, community high school,  a permanent site for the Buglasan, the Tabo sa PAO, and many other projects -- that have brought national and international recognition to the Province. His vision and loyalty to the Province is hard to match. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">-- Prof.  Leonor Briones-Magtolis, former National Treasurer </span><br><br>The greatest gift Governor Macias gave to Negros Oriental and Dumaguete is the rotonda and fountain that would replace the welcome entrance to the City from the pier.  It’s been an eight-year project, half of the budget of which the Governor has approved after learning of the delay in the construction due to financial reasons.  Macias was a visionary, and I admire him for it.  The Province may have lost a great leader, a compassionate achiever and worker. We should push through with the rotonda project and name it in honor of Governor Macias.  Perhaps in his death, the rotonda would become reality.  No other city from Aparri to Jolo has a rotonda fountain greeting its guests coming into their towns. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">-- Dr. Rico Absin, Dumaguete City Tourism Council </span><br><br>Governor Macias was consistent with his being a medical doctor.  Improvement of health care service in the Province was a priority for him. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">-- Dr. Susan Micaela Ozoa-Denura, cardiologist </span><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><br>Governor Macias excelled in every aspect of public service.

Gov. Dodo Macias showcased genuine public service to the fullest.  He has driven the Province to greater heights, which has taken us to a level that we are proud of.  He will be greatly remembered as the “cowboy” working Governor. Hurrah to Governor Macias!  We will miss him so much. God be with him. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">-- Engr. Jul Gallogo, proprietor, DN Steel Dumaguete </span><br><br>The greatest legacy of Governor Macias is infrastructure, especially the Lamberto Macias Cultural & Sports Complex. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">-- Rudy Juan, patron of the arts</span> <br><br>Governor Macias’ greatest legacy is upgrading the level of local government health care. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">-- Dr. Krypton Kho, neurosurgeon </span><br><br>Governor Macias has improved hospital services in the Province, including in the rual areas. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">-- Dr. Angel C. Alcala, chairperson, SU Angelo King Center for Research & Environmental Management </span><br><br>We may classify Governor Macias’ legacy into “hard” and “soft”: The hard part is easy – we can see the many structures built, and equipment installed during his long tenure.  The soft part is quite hard to define because it involves intangibles.  Although a politician, Governor Macias apparently succeeded in treading the honorable path, for he left behind a name untainted by scandal.  He developed a reputation for being independent-minded, even stubborn.  He often did things his own way.  This was his management style.  In this sense, he was a pioneer. But did he leave an indelible mark in our hearts and minds? Will succeeding generations remember him with respect and admiration as a great governor and a statesman?  Only time will tell.  For now, we mourn the passing of a man who tried a different path for our Province.  May he rest in peace.  <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"> -- Engr. Gilbert R.

His body and his face spell fear. What’s abnormal is not that he’s afraid, but that he shows it. <BR><BR>Fear is a normal feeling for ordinary people here, though it’s usually hidden behind a blank look, or a shy smile. They have good reason to be afraid. They have no special talents or skills to bargain with. They’re uneducated, and sometimes irresponsible. Many have no work, and even with jobs, they can barely earn enough to feed themselves and their families. They have no safety net. Any accident can leave them without means and without hope. <BR><BR>So they become totally dependent on the goodwill of those “above” them who have more money and power than they have; people who can help them or hurt them as they please. <BR><BR>Of course, they’re afraid of these people, and often dislike them, but to survive, they have to deal with them. So out of pride and caution, they hide their fears behind masks of “shyness” and “respect”. <BR><BR>Example: a young woman comes for an appointment with some official. She needs work, or needs to sell something, and this official has a reputation for being obnoxious and mean.  So she knocks timidly, sticks her head slowly inside the door as though she expects someone to hit her. “She’s very shy,” the official thinks; but actually, she’s only afraid the man will throw her out if she appears too “forward”, not “humble” enough. <BR><BR>And what of the young man in the picture holding himself so tightly? Perhaps he’s a rich woman’s driver, waiting for her to finish shopping. Maybe earlier, she scolded him infront of her friends because of a little mud on one wheel of the car. He’s afraid she’s still angry with him, and now, he has to ask her extra for medicine. <BR><BR>He hadn’t noticed the mud because he was tired from being up all night with his sick child. He hated her for embarrassing him, but he just said “Yes, ma’am; I’m sorry ma’am,” and gave her an apologetic smile. As they drove away, she must have said to her friends, “These foolish servants will never learn. But at least, this one has respect.” <BR><BR>Shyness and respect; other words for fear. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

While many others in his situation would have been pampered with such privileged upbringing, he chose a path which had been close to his heart and would define his life’s mission — service to the people, especially those who have less in life.<br><br>Perhaps it was the influence of his congressman-father which outlined the journey he would eventually lead. Perhaps it was his faith and piety borne out of and inculcated in his active membership in the Silliman University Church. Perhaps it was the education and training he obtained from Silliman University, which not only prepared him for professional competence but also ingrained in him an earnest belief and discipleship of Him who is the Via, Veritas, Vita — the Way, the Truth and the Life.<br><br>As a public servant, Dodo Macias was outstanding in his zeal to work for the betterment of the citizenry. He possessed a clear understanding of the plight of the underserved and has developed a brilliant vision on how to employ innovative programs, efficiently harnessing the province’s meager resources. <br><br>In any situation, he always proudly proclaimed his Silliman heritage. He always carried the distinction, with pride and honor, that he was nurtured and made whole by his Silliman experience.<br><br>Dodo was a true leader, in the sense that he was faithful to the admonition of Jesus Christ, who said that “he who wishes to be first shall be the last of all, and servant of all.” I have no doubt where Dodo is now. And I’m sure that when he first met his Maker on his ascension to the Great Beyond, there was a big smile on God’s face as He proclaimed, “Well done, good and faithful servant!”<br><br><i>(Ms. Duran-Bennett is the Chairperson of SUACONA)</i><br><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "As a rookie reporter working for PTV-Channel 10 in Dumaguete in 1989, my first assignment was to cover the Capitol beat where I met Gov. Macias for the first time. {{more}} From then on, with a handful of other reporters, we traversed the road not taken by many, alongside him.<BR><BR>News was scarce then, and so we, – Alex Pal, Jimmy Abayon, Bing Aguilar and Oliver Lemence, to mention a few -- became mainstay reporters at Capitol. It was during Gov. Dodo’s almost ten years as governor then that we were first exposed to and understood the grim reality of life in the countryside and that the province truly needed a facelift.<BR><BR>The projects he launched with fervor during his first three terms as governor, of which we had witnessed, covered and written about, were the 10-bed Community Primary Hospitals, all six of them in areas that were then almost hard to reach; the establishment of community high schools; the development and improvement of community-based resource management projects on social forestry, upland agriculture and fisheries, and the Neg Or 2000 superhighway road network, to name a few. <BR><BR>These and many more socio-economic and development projects that followed in his more than 30 years of public service have undoubtedly endeared him to the people of Negros Oriental, for during our interviews with project beneficiaries, they would express their undying gratitude to him. <BR><BR>On every single road trip with him, we watched in the sidelines as Gov. and later Cong. Macias connected with the people that he so loved and cared for, toiling hard, day and night, rain or shine, sacrificing time away from his family, to uplift the lives of and deliver the basic services to his constituents. People’s faces would light up when he cracked jokes with them, share a simple meal with them, and many times, he would sing his favorite song “Buta” in parting.<BR><BR>Gov. Macias was one person who welcomed the media not as a foe but as partners for progress. He understood and accepted the fact that as a journalist, we had to be sometimes critical in our reporting. He did not take offense. In some instances, he expressed disapproval over a news article we had written, but he was not the adversarial type. He would immediately call our attention personally and asked only one thing – to be fair, factual and objective and have his side of the story heard. <BR><BR>He took on and faced difficult challenges with dignity and grace, sometimes wanting things done in his own way to the point of being misunderstood by many. But, he also listened to, solicited and heeded the advice of others, even from us in the media, as Alex Pal, Maricar Aranas and the others can attest to. <BR><BR>He was a selfless, thoughtful, jovial, caring, generous, compassionate and loving person, and most of all, he had a big, kind heart and tons of humor.<BR><BR>On one occasion, sometime in the early 1990s, I tagged along to the Inapoy Community Primary Hospital in the boundaries of Mabinay, Negros Oriental and Kabankalan in Negros Occidental.<BR><BR>Back then, the only access to the Inapoy hospital was a makeshift cable car – just a small steel bucket contraption strung on steel cables that could accommodate only three people at one time – which we took across to the other side of the river. <BR><BR>Upon reaching the other side, he commented that there were crocodiles in the river, about 60 meters down below, looking up at us and waiting for when we would fall. I remember him telling me jokingly that I’d be the first prey for the crocodiles, as I was wearing a pair of short shorts. That was his brand of humor that I will never forget.<BR><BR>During the height of the insurgency in the late 80s and early 90s, Gov. Macias took one brave step to forge peace and usher in development, and this was to open roads that now lead to the then rebel-infested areas in the hinterlands of Sta. Catalina. Shortly thereafter, he endeavored to establish resettlement sites and provide livelihood for the hundreds of evacuees who fled to Dumaguete back then to escape the strife-torn Tamlang Valley. <BR><BR>I remember very clearly the convoy that snaked through dirt roads, if you could even call them that, steep climbs and muddy potholes until we reached the dead end, with still several kilometers to walk and a river to cross before we could get to Sitio Avocado. Governor Macias was so enthusiastic to reach Avocado that he walked so fast ahead of us; it was difficult for us to catch up with him. That was how he did things -- with untiring energy, passion, dedication and determination.<BR><BR>All of the above have earned my respect for a man that was not just a news source or a media subject, but somebody that I have looked up to as a friend, a father, a leader, and a hero.<BR><BR>One of my last conversations with him early this year, when he took me and another reporter, Syril Repe, to see his boardwalk project in Luka, Tanjay City, was heart-rending. When I mentioned about how we in the media miss going out on road trips, his answer was, and I quote, “I do not want to put you in harm’s way”, end of quote. That showed his caring and protective nature. <BR><BR>Last year, after the launch of his Paningkamot Caravan in Basay town, we shared a simple lunch of boiled kamote and dried fish or “bulad.” Each time a few pieces of grilled “bulad” were served up, he would cut off the heads for himself, and give the rest to us. Maricar and I took this as a sign of his generosity and selflessness. <BR><BR>What I have just shared with you is only a small slice of the large pie of personal and professional experiences I have had with Governor Macias. <BR><BR>Rest easy, governor, for you are now in God’s loving arms. We will definitely miss you, but one thing is certain, you will always be loved and remembered, forever and beyond. Thank you for everything that you have done for us. Thank you for the legacy that you have left us. And to the bereaved family of the late Gov. Dodo, thank you for sharing him with us. <BR><BR>I’ll end my tribute with a favorite quote: “The most honorable gifts of goodness are given to us in secret. It flows from a good heart, a heart that has no need to be recognized. A heart that sacrifices without a hint of resentment. A heart that joyfully shares what is hardest to share, our very selves.” <BR><BR>We love you, Governor Macias.<BR>",

Meanwhile, Perdices has said he will assume the governorship on June 30.<BR>",

   "body": "Vice Governor-elect Agustin Perdices is preparing to assume as Governor of Negros Oriental on June 30 following a vacancy in the governorship with the death of Governor and governor-elect Emilio Macias II. {{more}}<BR><BR>Perdices announced his intention to assume the governorship in a telephone interview, after lawyers started airing differing views over whether the next governor would be Perdices or would be chosen by special election. {{more}}<BR><BR>\"They'll have to go to court to stop me,\" Perdices said.<BR><BR>For Dean Mikhail Lee Maxino of the Silliman University College of Law, this is a very novel legal issue because there is yet no legal jurisprudence that squarely addresses this case. \"The Local Government Code does not use those terms used in the Constitution in referring to the death or incapacity of the President-elect or the Vice President-elect. Rather, the LGC uses the term 'elective'--not 'elected'--local officials.\"<BR><BR>\"If you strictly understand the word elective, it refers to the office of governor, vice governor, etc. It assumes that there should be someone there who took an oath of office and something happened to him. The line of succession will not kick in if the governor-elect was unable to take his oath because there's nobody in that office to be succeeded.\"<BR><BR>Maxino said at the time the vacancy occurred, Vice-Governor-elect Agustin Perdices was still not the Vice Governor.  <BR><BR>The second school of thought, Maxino continued, is that it will be Perdices who will become the full-fledged Governor. Succession, he said is when the vice-governor elect succeeds to the governor-elect who has died, failed to qualify, refused to assume office, or become permanently incapacitated.  <BR><BR>He said section 8 of article X of the constitution providing the term of office of elective local officials at strictly three years has disallowed elective officials to stay in office on a \"holdover\" capacity after their term.<BR><BR>Another argument for succession, he said is section 44 of the Local Government Code. \"This is broad enough to cover death before taking the oath of office.<BR><BR>Another law,  section 4 of RA 2264, expanding local autonomy, provides that should the provincial governor-elect die or fail to quality, the provincial vice-governor elect becomes governor. \"This was not expressly repealed by the local government code (RA 7160)\", Maxino said.<BR><BR>Finally, the omnibus election code does not provide for special elections for local elective positions. Thus, special elections was never contemplated precisely because sec 44 of the local government code and RA 2264 already cover the issue of succession created by the death of our governor, Maxino said.<BR><BR>City Legal Officer Neil Ray Lagahit, meanwhile, said that while there may yet be no Supreme Court ruling on the matter, the Department of Interior and Local Government, on several occasions, had already ruled in favor of the Vice Governor-elect or Vice Mayor-elect. <BR><BR>For Regional Court Administrator Rafael Cresencio Tan, there may be a need for a special election. \"I will have to study the Local Government Code but there is an opinion by some lawyers and judges that the Comelec will have to issue a special resolution calling for a special election. But this would depend on whether the Comelec would call for it. He said the likely scenario, should his opinion be given weight, is that Perdices will take his oath as Vice Governor on June 30 and then take an oath as Acting Governor. The other elected officials will also take a second oath as acting officials for posts one rank higher.<BR><BR>While admitting that there are lawyers with different opinions, Rep. George Arnaiz said the next Governor would be Perdices. \"It's very simple -- there's no reason for him to be acting governor if there's no governor to be sworn in. There's already a law that provides for it. When there's a vacancy existing in the office of the governor, the vice governor takes over. It doesn't matter whether the governor-elect was able to take his oath or not because if he is able to take his oath and he dies, the same law will apply.\"<BR><BR>MCTC Judge Antonio Alcantara, meanwhile, said the vice governor-elect will move up and assume the governorship, bringing up all the other elected officials one rank higher.  \"They will have to take two oaths of office on June 30--one for the position that they ran for and won and the other will be for the next higher position,\" Alcantara said.<BR><BR>Provincial Election Supervisor Atty. Eddie Aba said that the new governor of Negros Oriental on June 30 will be Vice-Governor-elect Agustin Perdices and Provincial Board Member Roel Degamo as the new Vice Governor. This is because of the provision on vacancies and succession as outlined in the Local Government Code of 1991 and subsequent vacancies will the Sangguniang Panlalawigan shall be filled automatically by the other sangguniang members according to their ranking.<BR><BR>Baldado, meanwhile, had earlier filed a petition before the Commission on Elections shortly after the elections seeking to disqualify Gov. Emilio Macias II from running for re-election on account of his health. The petition is now pending with the Comelec. If the Comelec agrees to disqualify Macias even after his proclamation, that would make Baldado as the governor-elect.<BR>",

He earned his commission after his graduation from the Officer Cadet School in Portsea, Victoria, Australia on Dec. 3, 1974.  He resigned his regular commission when he became a lawyer in 1989, but was subsequently commissioned in the reserve force.  He obtained his law degree from Silliman University in 1988, where he also finished his AB in Mathematics in 1970, and a Master’s degree in Public Administration in 1994 under the first batch of scholars of the Local Scholarship Program of the Civil Service Commission.<BR><BR>As an Army Officer, Judge Tan had exceptional achievements.

He proudly remembers his parents inculcating in him the values of honesty and great ideals, making him meticulously prepare for his cases thoroughly, updating himself on law and jurisprudence.<BR><BR>As Regional Court Administrator of the pilot Regional Court Administration Office in the 7th Judicial Region, Judge Tan tackled the problems hounding the first and second level courts in the region.  The RCAO was a milestone in judicial reform history.  It became a shining jewel of the Supreme Court’s effort in decentralizing the administrative and financial functions of the Office of the Court Administrator.  RCAO 7 sought to bring out the efficiency of support, services, and resources to the trial courts in the region. <BR> <BR>RCAO 7 has been proven to be a success, that the Supreme Court has now established two more RCAOs in Regions 3 and 11.<BR><BR>Judge Tan is happily married to Dr. Betsy Joy Bustamante Tan, vice president for Academic Affairs of Silliman University, with whom he has two daughters: Maricris Joy working with Chinabank, and Mia Crisanee working with Globe Telecom.<BR><BR>\"I dedicate this award to all the people of Negros Oriental, and also for me to strive better and to be of service to them, as I return to RTC Branch 30 Dumaguete City this July 1, 2010,\" Tan said.<BR><BR><BR><A HREF=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/JudgeTan1.pdf\" TARGET=_blank>Greetings from family and friends.</A><BR><BR><A HREF=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/JudgeTan2.pdf\" TARGET=_blank>Greetings from Silliman Medical  Center Family.</A><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

   "url": "the-rule-of-succession-p169-298.htm",
   "body": "{{more}} <BR>In the aftermath of the untimely demise of our beloved Governor Emilio Macias II there are conflicting views regarding the status of the Office of the Governor considering that an election has just been carried out and a proclamation duly done. The issue at hand is succession and the law on the matter is Section 44 of the Local Government Code. Let us therefore educate ourselves. The law says: <BR><BR> “(a) If a permanent vacancy occurs in the office of the Governor or mayor, the vice-governor or vice-mayor concerned shall become the governor or mayor. If a permanent vacancy occurs in the offices of the governor, vice-governor, mayor or vice-mayor, the highest ranking sanggunian member or, or in case of his permanent inability, the second highest ranking sanggunian member, shall become governor, vice-governor, mayor or vice-mayor as the case may be. Subsequent vacancies in said offices shall be filled automatically by the other sanggunian members according to their rank as defined herein.  <BR><BR> (b) If a permanent vacancy occurs in the office of the punong barangay, the highest ranking sangguniang barangay member or, in case of his permanent inability, the second highest ranking sanggunian member, shall become the punong barangay. <BR><BR> (c) A tie between and among the highest ranking sanguniang members shall be resolved by the drawing of lots.<BR><BR> (d) THE SUCCESSOR AS DEFINED HEREIN SHALL SERVE ONLY THE UNEXPIRED TERMS OF THEIR PREDECEESORS.<BR><BR> For purposes of this chapter, a permanent vacancy arises when an elective local official fills a higher vacant office, refuses to assume office, fails to qualify, dies, removed from office, voluntarily resigns or is otherwise permanently incapacitated to discharge the functions of his office.<BR><BR> For purposes of succession as provided in this chapter, ranking in the sangunian shall be determined on the basis of the proportion of votes obtained by each winning candidate to the total number of registered voters in each district in the immediately preceding local elections.”  <BR><BR> Let us observe that the law defines what a vacancy is and also describes the parameters of the term of the successor. There are seven ways that is contemplated by law that cause a vacancy – 1) when the officer fills a higher position, 2) when the officer refuses to assume office, 3) when the officer fails to qualify, 4) when the officer dies, 5) when the officer is removed from office, 6) when the officer resigns and 7) when the officer is permanently incapacitated to discharge the functions of his office. In all these circumstances the aforesaid successors shall take over and assume the vacated position. Take note however, that the law mandates that the successor shall serve only the unexpired term of his predecessor. <BR><BR> A mature perusal of the entire provision of law leads us to conclude that in order for succession under this provision to occur, the TERM OF OFFICE OF THE PREDECCESOR should have started to begin and the SUCCESSOR shall merely serve the unexpired term.<BR><BR> The question to be asked therefore is whether or not the TERM OF THE LATE GOVERNOR MACIAS EVER STARTED TO BEGIN. I humbly submit, as a former member of the legal academe, that the term has never started to begin. The reason is that Macias’ term under his previous mandate is yet to end at noon of June 30, 2010, then and only then shall his new term begin. Certainly, there could not have been an overlapping of term. As a matter of fact, as of the time of demise of the Governor, the vice-governor took over and he shall serve the unexpired term of the former up to and until noon of June 30, 2010. <BR><BR> Incidentally, the DILG rendered an opposite opinion in a similar situation where the late Hon. Heraldo D. Dacayo of the Municipality of Solano, Nueva Viscaya was proclaimed winner in the May 10, 2004 election but died before assuming office. Clearly, the Dacayo case is exactly the same as the present situation in the Province of Negros Oriental. In that case, the DILG, quite wrongly I would say, interpreted the death of the officer as equivalent to failure to qualify for the reason that he could not take his oath of office and assume the powers, duties and functions thereof. It should be underscored that by reason of death, the officer concerned is no longer in office long before the expiration of his supposed term and long before the new term is to begin. Failure to qualify by noon of June 30, 2010 is out of the issue. Moreover, at a closer examination, the issue in the DACAYO CASE is not whether Section 44 of the LGC applies; rather the primordial issue there is whether or not a special election is to be had. <BR><BR> In summation, there is NO GOVERNOR of Negros Oriental after noon of June 30, 2010. The vice-governor elect nor anybody else could not assume the office of the governor under Section 44 of the Local Government Code. Whatever solution, political or otherwise, to be had under the given circumstances I am certain that Section 44 of the LGC is not the law to apply.    <BR><BR><A HREF=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Obar.pdf\" TARGET=_blank>Click here for my page.</A><BR> <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

On one hand, Vice-Gov.-elect Agustin Perdices is preparing to assume as Governor after he is sworn in as Vice-Governor on June 30.

He immersed himself into a hectic election campaign, perhaps sometimes, making undue demands to his old and weakened body.  One more time, one final term as Governor. {{more}} He was raging against the dying light.  Raging for the love of public service.  Raging and raging for the love of the Province of Negros Oriental. Fiercely raging to set aflame the love for her people which he fondly called Negrosanon.<br><br>This is Gov. Emilio \"Dodo\" Macias II in retrospect, doing rather than declaring that the Negrosanon is worth dying for.<br><br>Dodo served the public for four decades.  He started as a delegate to the 1972 Constitutional Convention.  He served in various capacities subsequently as Board Member, Vice Governor, Health Deputy Minister, Governor, Congressman, and Governor again. His last hurrah was to be a second-term governor in another nine-year cycle as allowed by the Constitution.<br><br>In his early years as Governor, he rallied the Negrosanons to take pride in themselves.  The core of his public thrust was emblazoned in the provincial government's vehicles--Basta Negor.  Dodo conceptualized the slogan as he took the initiative to coordinate with the Negros Occidental officials on equal terms in launching the much-needed government projects in the mountain border areas such the government hospital. One island, one vision, one goal.  An astute political stroke to the national misconception that relegates Dumaguete City and Negros Oriental playing second fiddle to Bacolod City and Negros Occidental.<br><br>He promulgated that education is a right, not a privilege.  To make it real especially to the youth in the hinterland barangays, Dodo's Basta Negor Program keeps on constructing high school buildings.  The target is 55 school buildings throughout the province. <br><br>Being a doctor by profession, he proclaimed that everyone has the right to affordable health services.  Dodo made it affordable by establishing Community Hospitals especially in remote areas and by equipping the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital with the modern medical facilities.  He also encouraged the use of herbal medicine in reducing medical expenses.  The Pateros family whose father was the driver of Cong. Lamberto Macias remembered that they were treated by the Congressman's son Dr. Macias for free.<br><br>He taught the Negrosanons that a healthy body thrives in a healthy environment.  He put this into practice in Lake Balanan, Siaton where village folks and visitors alike are encouraged to plant trees in being a good steward of the environment.  The project is bringing back wildlife to the denuded area and is becoming a thriving mountain resort destination for both local and foreign tourists.    <br><br>Dodo was fertile in his conception of government services, rich in words, much richer in his deeds.  He started as Mr. Clean when he first assumed as governor in 1988.  He remained  with his integrity untainted until his dying days.   President-elect Noynoy might have intuitively recognized this when he paid his last respect to Dodo at the Manila Memorial Park Chapel.   Noynoy in his Independence Day speech said, one must not only be willing to die for his country but must be ready to live for it as well.  Dodo was the living example of this paradigm.  <br><br>In his waning years, Dodo embarked on his last hurrah.  He won.  Yet he received it with open hands heavenward.  Vice-Gov. Jose \"Petit\" Baldado felt sad over Dodo's death.  He declared, \"This is a sad day for Province of Negros Oriental.\"  He was speaking for Negrosanons who was in mourning who will be missing Dodo in the days to come.<br><br>Dodo was born to serve and fated to die serving.  <br><br></div>",

   "body": "<BR>2KI 23: 25 <BR> Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the Lord as he did— with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, in accordance with all the Law of Moses. <BR><BR>Josiah was only eight years old when he became king of Judah. His father, King Amon was assassinated by his own officials at a young age of 24, and so Josiah was crowned king to replace his father. Josiah was the 14th king of Judah, and was one of the best kings Judah ever had. He ruled the kingdom with the help of his mother, Jedidah. <BR><BR>Before him, there were only three kings who did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, while the others, including his own father, worshipped idols and did not walk in the ways of the Lord. <BR><BR>In 2 Kings 22, we read that on the 18th year of his reign as king, while he was 26 years old, King Josiah undertook an important project: the restoration of the temple of Jerusalem which had been destroyed for many years. One day, King Josiah sent his secretary , a man named Shaphan, to the temple to speak with the High Priest Hilkiah about temple collections that were intended to be used for the project. <BR><BR>While in the temple, Shaphan learned from the high priest Hilkiah that they had accidentally found the Book of Law in the course of the restoration. <BR> <BR>The Book of the Law, which contains all the instructions given by God to Moses , was a very sacred religious artifact for the Israelites that may have been lost during one of the military attacks done against Judah. <BR><BR>The High Priest Hilkiah gave it to Shaphan, who in turn, immediately read its contents. When Shaphan returned to the palace and he gave King Josiah an update about the temple restoration, he also said, “Hilkiah the High Priest also gave me a book,” and immediately, he read the Book of the Law before the presence of the King. <BR><BR>When Book of the Law was being read before King Josiah, a powerful spirit of conviction fell upon him, and he began to tear his robes, a biblical expression of deep remorse, grief and conviction. <BR><BR>Fearing the wrath of the Lord for his entire kingdom for all the sins they had done based on the Book of the Law, he sent five of his top officials to the prophets of Judah to inquire of the Lord. <BR><BR>“To inquire of the Lord” in biblical language means to receive a word of revelation from God through the intercession of the prophets. <BR><BR>King Josiah instructed his leaders, “Great is the Lord’s anger that burns against us because our fathers have not obeyed the Book of the Law. They have not acted in accordance with all that is written there concerning us.” <BR><BR>Through a prophetess, a lady named Huldah, King Josiah received a revelation from God. God said through the prophet, “I will destroy the descendants of Judah because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods… But because your heart was responsive and you humbled before the Lord, I have heared you.” <BR><BR>Immediately after receiving the revelation of God, King Josiah ordered all the elders of the land, all the important officials of Judah, all the priests and prophets and all the people in the land from the greatest to the least , to gather in the Temple. There, King Josiah, led his entire nation in the presence of God. <BR><BR>King Josiah personally read before his people the Book of the Law, and led his countrymen to renew their broken covenant with the Lord—to follow the Lord and keep his commands, regulations and decrees with all his heart and his soul… <BR><BR>What followed was an unprecedented cleansing of the whole nation. He ordered all his temple officials, headed by the High Priest Hilkiah, to destroy all the articles in the temple that were used to worship idols. Throughout the kingdom, King Josiah desecrated all the places that were used to sacrifice other gods. He put to death all the pagan priests who did not worship the God of Israel. He destroyed the shrines for male prostitutes which proliferated in the kingdom and he desecrated Topheth, a mystical place in Judah where people would sacrifice their own sons and daughters to a god named Molech in exchange for wealth and fortune. King Josiah also made sure that all the mediums and spiritist were put to death. Finally, King Josiah ordered the entire kingdom to celebrate, for the very first time again, the Passover, a sacred celebration of worship that commemorated the supernatural escape of the Israelites from the Egyptians by crossing the Red Sea. <BR><BR>In 2 Kings 23: 25 we read, “Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the Lord as he did—with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength in accordance with all the Laws of Moses.” <BR><BR>My prayer for our newly elected Philippine President Noynoy Aquino and Vice President Jejomar Binay, and for us who consider ourselves leaders in our respective spheres of endeavors is that we shall all learn from the life of this great King Josiah. <BR><BR>He knew how to listen to the voice of the Lord. He had the courage to cleanse his nation from spiritual filth. He respected the voice of the prophets. He wanted his leadership to be pleasing to the Lord, first and foremost. <BR><BR>King Josiah reigned in Judah until he was 39. He was fatally wounded during a war with Egypt that abruptly ended his reign. <BR><BR>Even after his death, King Josiah was revered by his entire nation, and his memory as a great king never departed from the hearts of the people he served well, and the Lord whom he turned to with all his heart, soul and strength. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

The show features the country’s highly celebrated singers Ana Feleo, Karla Patricia Gutierrez, Ma. Florence Aguilar-Barquez, Arlynne Lupas-Tecson, Jennifer Villegas, Sherwin Sozon, Glenn Gaerlan and Nazer Salcedo. This comes after <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Harana’s</span> first Visayan tour last May as part of the National Heritage Festival celebration. <br><br>When POC launched the show in 2008, it reaped good notices from audiences and critics. Julie Yap-Daza in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Manila Bulletin</span>, wrote: “How long have we waited for such an endearing piece of artful, delightful entertainment.” Rosalinda Orosa also noted in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">StarWeek Magazine: “Harana</span> has garnered prolonged, deafening applause.” <br><br>Harana refers to the traditional form of courtship where a man woos a woman’s affection by singing underneath her window. In the 1920s, the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">harana</span> or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">kundiman</span> became a mainstream musical style, with many popular performers including Diomedes Maturan and Ruben Tagalog performing it. The company writes of its intentions: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“A celebration of this musical tradition comes in a time when the country is rapidly losing an appreciation of Filipino music to foreign influences. Many people are no longer interested in listening to Filipino classics, composed by gifted Filipino geniuses.”</span> <br><br>Philippine Opera Company’s cultural repertoire showcases the evolution of Philippine music through song, movement and drama. The show consists of six suites—the Igorot, Maria Clara, Rural, Folk, Muslim, and the Contemporary—each theatrically presented with authenticity and visual excitement. The creation of each suite is a product of thorough research, with the commitment to preserve indigenous music, dance and folklore. POC’s skill is evident as it restructures and enhances this research to evolve into a show of great appeal to theater. Contemporary audiences will find the performance an absolute feast to the senses. <br><br>Repertoire for the tour includes timeless classics such as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Bituing Marikit, Dahil sa Isang Bulaklak, Iyo Kailan pa Man, Kalesa, Ang Maya, Ano kaya ang Kapalaran?, Dumbele, Ay Salidumay, Waray-Waray, Sa Kabukiran, Manang Biday, Atin cu pung Singsing, Pobreng Alindahaw, Saan ka nan Naroroon?, Gaano ko ikaw Kamahal?, Usahay </span>and<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Hindi kita Malimot.</span> <br><br>Future shows from the CAC include Silly People’s Improv Theater Live in Dumaguete, the Ryan Cayabyab Singers in Concert, the Philippine Madrigal Singers in Concert, Douglas Nierras’ Powerdance in Aerial Suite, Coke Bolipata and the Pundaquit Virtuosi in Concert, the Celso Espejo Rondalla in Concert, the La Libertad Children’s Rondalla in Concert, Children’s Letters to God, and Silliman Performs with the Kayahag Dance Troupe in a Lucy Jumawan Dance Tribute.

Made of either concrete or wood, they are a blank slate that is conducive for creative expression via paint and what- not. Our hands itch to make use of that blankness—to “defile” it to make beauty. Think of murals. Michaelangelo’s painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. The Mexican epics of Diego Rivera. Or Hersley-Ven Casero’s magical scrawls on Foundation University’s walls. Think of street graffiti. Along the byways of New York. The Berlin Wall, on the West German side, before it was torn down. The wall that right now divides Palestine and Israel—a virtual gallery of artful protests. <img src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Wall.jpg\" align=\"left\" border=\"0\"><br><br>There are bad ones, of course, like the pedantic displays of minor imagination on the fences along Dumaguete’s Cathedral of St. Alexandria. We have something of that sort in Silliman University—the Freedom Wall in front of Doltz Hall. The graffiti on that wall began near the end of the Martial Law, and was inspired by the boxed paintings in the Catacombs in the basement of Silliman Church. That was 1983, and Doltz Hall President Hitch Montayre hatched that idea of a wall as an avenue of expression— and to solve the problem of rampant vandalism in the dormitory. <br><br>Last Thursday, June 17, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Moses Joshua Atega</span>—a liaison officer of Silliman—posted a photo of the school’s famous Freedom Wall in his Facebook page, with this [edited] note of lamentation: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“They erased history. Doltz Hallers’ Freedom Wall is gone! Without sensitivity, they ‘cleaned it up,’ and [now] Doltz Hall alumni are reacting. It’s back as a boring wall. A favorite campus landmark is gone! The Wall made Silliman cool, and a lot of education leaders were actually learning from its sense of purpose. I am proud of the tradition of how one would earn a space on the Freedom Wall. A graduating Doltz Hall big brother would select from his small brothers, and the one chosen would then show the design to his big brother before it is finally announced as the “successor.” It’s a bond of brotherhood: the show of care for the small brother. Sometimes, both the big and the small brothers would decide to share the space, with the small brother’s commitment to protect the space in all his four years of existence in college. It’s all awesome to witness how some would gather extra coins from room to room just for them to have money to buy the expensive concrete paint and brushes. Others would solicit money from their girlfriends….” </span><br><br>A barrage of comments— most of them outraged—soon followed. Here is a selection, all of them edited for clarity and brevity, the entire thread finally telling us a story of arguments, counter-arguments, and so on and so forth—a perfect demonstration of a community sharing ideas about art, heritage, the values placed on generations, the need for change, and all that jazz… <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Hersley-Ven Casero:</span> When I first entered the campus and saw that wall, I thought it defined the “U” in S.U.—unique. Nganong gi-erase? Bali pud. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ian Rosales Casocot:</span> But who erased the wall? Then again, graffiti walls are meant to be fluid. But if there will be a  reincarnation of this, I hope these “expressions” can go beyond just the mere painting on of names and actually have something that resembles good street art. But don’t anyone get me wrong. I love that wall. I hate that they erased it. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Moses Atega:</span> Old folks found it dirty. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ian Rosales Casocot:</span> Old folks?

You are very much welcome! But just the freedom wall, not the pelota courts inside. And be more creative rather than just simply write your names. We want to do this with you, guys. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Jojo Antonio:</span> I understand all your concerns. It was a difficult decision for the University. We have our own stories in Silliman, but the new generation should create their own also. You know we can’t create additional walls and that is simply the beauty of change. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Rick Reje:</span> One word—respetar! Nihimo unta ug agreement ang University sa tanang naay pangalan diha sa Freedom Wall about this change. Yada yada yada. Wala nila na nakuha ang spot by chance or by raffle. Hinaguan na ang mga slots diha. Some even had to shell out money para mapalit lang gyud ang gamay na space, ang uban nagpakaulaw intawon sa daghang tawo, some even prayed the longest prayer in their lives just to get that small spot and be part of Silliman’s history. The Freedom Wall does not belong to Silliman, it belongs to Sillimanians. Silliman should recognize the fact that only the owner of the slot has the right to erase or give it away. Respetar lang gyud unta, respetar! </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ed Dames:</span> That Freedom Wall represented older generations and their unique way of expression. It shouldn’t be repainted over just to accommodate the now generation.

It must be about personal expressions of dreams, aspirations, and even critical views. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ian Rosales Casocot:</span> Jojo, actually, I see your point. I also see the point that the walls should be more than just names. I would love to see something more creative. But at the same time, I feel the pain of most people commenting here, especially the former Doltz Hallers, because those were names set in history. They will never come back again. It’s like being one of those prisoners by the Japanese in Hibbard Hall. They etched their names and their experiences on the walls—only to have these historical footnotes cemented and painted over after the war. I talked to Architect Almagro once about the challenge of restoring the immigration processing center in Ellis Island in New York. When immigrants from all over were quarantined in the island for months at a time, they made graffiti of names all over. When the restorers in the 1980s were considering what to do with these graffiti, they eventually decided they were of historical importance. What they did was to “clean” up the walls to make the markings more visible, and then they put glass protection over them. Sana lang Silliman considered the wall the same way. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Taptap Abellanosa:</span> They could have accommodated the younger generations to the other wall fronting Abby Jacobs.... </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Betson Cajayon:</span> I had to pay for my space with a lechon manok to have a space! </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">John Melson Pelenio:</span> I was a name on that wall, but painted to be erased. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Joshua Ablong:</span> Now that an explanation has been given regarding the erasures, I still don’t blame those who reacted at all, they were acting on shock. To avoid problems, it is incumbent upon the administration to give prior notice before making drastic changes. Now, since erasures will happen from here onwards (as explained), then perhaps the admin should take pictures of the wall before they make such a cleanup to preserve the painted memories and make a display of it, perhaps in the Sillimaniana section. Memories are one of the many reasons why the alumni love Silliman. If the University truly values that “affection” then perhaps the admin should start to be sensitive. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Earnest Hope Tinambacan:</span> Wala’y picture-picture makabalik ana!

There’s no real freedom there! </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Shanti Harris:</span> Preserving memories through photographs is a great idea. Perhaps even keep these photos in the Silliman archive in the library. “Clean-up” can be scheduled. This way, whoever would leave their mark would know how long their mark will remain before the “new generation” takes over. It wouldn’t hurt to post a notice prior to the “clean-up,” too. It’s sad, really sad. Please set expectations moving forward. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pristine Raymond:</span> I liked the wall as it was, and now, after hearing that there are stories behind it, I like it even more. Too bad they erased it all. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Richard Pavia:</span> I love Silliman. But they seem to be developing a habit of changing, tearing down, painting over, cutting down, removing, and adding structures and things without asking or even informing the community in advance.... </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Joshua Ablong:</span> I agree with you. Personally, I’m deeply frustrated with recent structures on campus. It destroys the ambience and well, the historical character of the university. I’m not against structures per se, but what I’m trying to put forward is this, in case they want new structures on campus, they should take into consideration its over-all effect on the surroundings, and most importantly, it’s architecture. It must have some architectural value to justify its presence, and one which coincides with the Classical, Gothic or Romanesque theme of the campus. But now that an explanation has been given for the erasures (that the admin will erase it every five years to make room for others), I still don’t blame those who reacted at all (particularly on Kuya Moe’s post regarding the wall). They were acting on shock. This is the very first time (at least to my knowledge) for the University to unilaterally do such a change. To avoid problems, it is incumbent upon the administration to give prior notice before making such drastic changes. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Richard Pavia:</span> So true. It seems that the school is developing an “Act Now, Ask Questions Later’ attitude on many things. Case in point: Portal West versus trees. Never in my life have I seen a building constructed 18 inches from a tree. To do that, they had to do major damage to the tree’s roots. And then, when one of the trees started to die— the narra near the ATMs—they put up this sign: Help Us Save This Tree. We Welcome Your Ideas. Maybe they should’ve asked that question before the started constructing Portal West? As for the wall, I understand that a 5-year cycle is okay. Hell, a yearly cycle even sounds good. An entire graduating batch can have a whole year to paint their ideas, and then, maybe April or May, they will be given the chance to have their pictures taken against their batch wall, to be preserved for posterity. And yes, maybe the library can have a “wall” section for each year. But still, I think a long consultation period should have been done. And, to close, what makes Silliman so unique among all the other schools that I’ve attended or visited is the spirit of community that we have, that, whether you are just a student, or staff, or one of the big bosses, you actually feel you belong, that you and your ideas matter. Times may be a changing. </span><br><br>But you know what I love the most?

I chanced upon his name when I was still in high school once a long time ago, but it didn’t interest  silly me, then…until I grew up, mentally, and began to understand what it really meant to me as a Filipino. <BR><BR>Excavated by the late Robert B. Fox, an anthropologist who headed the archeological excavations by the National Museum in the 1960’s (yes, we do have archeologists in this country), the fossils of Tabon Man were estimated to have represented a man who existed  (in Palawan) between 24,000 to 22,000 BC.

Why, must we say primitive when nowadays, most wear the same fashionable thing on a beach outing.  Could it be that the bahag  was the most fashionable and functional in that era? <BR><BR>Let’s forget about the preconceived notions of our first inhabitants and look simply at the dates. China, the ancient and mystical country with decades of history is said to have been inhabited by the Peking Man roughly 500,000 years ago. Tabon Man inhabited the Tabon Caves from 50,000 to 9,000 years ago.  We may not be as ancient as the Chinese—offset by 450,000 years, but we are ancient, nevertheless. <BR><BR>Looked like they used to be a Stone Age manufacturing plant “with both finished stone flake tools and waste core flakes having been found at four separate levels in the main chamber.” (Wikipedia, Tabon Man). <BR><BR>We were not just living, breathing and eating 50,000 years ago; we had the ingenuity and audacity to build a factory of stone flake tools!  We were creative and bold even then! <BR><BR>In 1975, another excavation took place.  This time it was in Butuan City, Agusan del Norte. A remarkable thing was excavated.  Boat artifacts. <BR><BR>What?  Boat artifacts.  Ho-hum…boring….   I thought so too.  Details will always bore us until we connect them  with what they really mean, so linger a little longer…. <BR><BR>The boats, eight in all, measured 15 meters in length and 3 meters in width.  The size meant these boats were capable of travelling long distances. Dated from between AD 235 to AD 1385, these proved the theory that our early inhabitants at the turn of the millennium “were already engaged in elaborate trade with their neighbors, particularly the Chinese and other Southeast Asian peoples.” (Jocano, F. Landa 1998) <BR><BR>Pre-colonial.  A history long before our “history.”  Few people know this.  Few people will unless we start a trend to look closer. <BR><BR>Our history did not begin when Magellan came to town. Life did not begin on 1521. <BR><BR>We have a vast wealth of prehistoric culture, arts, oral literature and our own way of life. <BR><BR>Now, you may know more about who we were before the day Magellan came to town. <BR><BR>Hinilawod the play, is simply put, not just a play.  It is a declaration of the courageous and mighty pre-colonial roots of the Filipino people. Hinilawod is our ancient oral literature—one of the many pieces— that survived the test of time and the clash of cultures. It is one of the longest Philippine epics with 28, 000 lines.  Unearthed and transcribed from Kinaray-a to English  by anthropologist- historian F. Landa Jocano for 42 years.  Such devotion from a man who with wisdom wrote, “Our prehistoric past is the foundation of our present society.”<BR> <BR>As another wise man understood, “Ang hindi marunong lumingon sa pinanggagalingan ay hindi makararating sa paroroonan.” (Dr. Jose Rizal) <BR><BR>Look to the past and forge to the future. <BR><BR>HINILAWOD.

Jose \"Petit\" Baldado and Vice-Governor-elect Agustin \"Tuting\" Perdices on June 30. {{more}}<BR><BR>Interviewed by phone, Arnaiz said he arranged the meeting with the two officials over lunch Tuesday at the Perdices-owned Mamia Restaurant to discuss the terms of a peaceful transfer of power, after doubts were cast by several lawyers as to who would be the rightful successor to the vacancy created by the death of Governor-elect Emilio Macias II last June 13.<BR><BR>Lawyers are divided on whether Perdices is entitled to move up to the post of Governor based on the rule of succession in the Local Government Code or whether a special election is needed to select a new governor. In the absence of a Supreme Court ruling on the matter, some lawyers say the two opposing legal angles need to be tested through a court case.<BR><BR>Perdices had earlier said he is bent on being sworn in as Governor of Negros Oriental immediately after he assumes the position of Vice Governor on June 30. <BR><BR>In Monday's lunch meeting, both Arnaiz and Perdices said Baldado agreed to peacefully step down as Governor and turn over the Office to Perdices. <BR><BR>But Arnaiz said the agreement does not mean that Baldado would not anymore raise some legal issues. \"We agreed that Petit will give the office to Tuting but as to how the case will go is something for Petit to decide,\" Arnaiz said in a telephone interview.<BR><BR>\"My impression was that Baldado was in favor of the suggestion of Arnaiz not to file a Quo Warranto case but a case for Declaratory Relief, but I think he still wants to convince his lawyers,\" Perdices said.<BR><BR>Arnaiz, however, said he offered no such advice to Baldado. \"My only interest is in a smooth turnover. I will not interfere on their legal problems,\" he said.<BR><BR>A Quo Warranto case would challenge Perdices' act of assuming the post of Governor, where he would have to prove that he has the right to legally assume as Governor. If this happens, Perdices can only assume as Vice Governor and Acting Governor, while the matter is being settled.<BR>  <BR>On the other hand, a case for Declaratory Relief would mean that Baldado will ask the court to declare who should rightfully assume the position of Governor.<BR><BR>\"I will take over the Office of the Governor either in an acting capacity or as the full-fledged Governor of the Province,\" Perdices said.<BR><BR>When contacted for comment, Baldado said the meeting was cordial, but he declined to comment on what they had agreed on. He promised to issue a statement later Wednesday.<BR><BR>Baldado, last May 13, had asked the Commission on Elections to nullify the victory of Macias and instead declare him as the rightful winner in the May 10 elections. He pursued this case by filing a Memorandum before the Comelec on June 15. This matter is still pending before the Comelec.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

The country has failed to meet this goal for the marine environment. If our record in protecting our land environment is critically evaluated, I think that we have also failed the test.<br><br>We have failed to improve the conditions of our marine environment. First, we have  protected and managed only three percent of the 25,000-km<sup>2</sup> coral reef ecosystem since the 1970s, the year the community-based coastal resource management was started. Our recent assessment of the Visayas region no-take marine reserves in 2008 showed that only 30% of the 564 reserves are functional, down from about 40% in 2004-2005 based on a small sample of marine reserves in the Central Visayas. In the Visayas, about 70% of these reserves have not been protected well by the local communities and local government units. <br><br>Second, the catch per unit effort from single hook and line fishing gear in unprotected coastal areas has remained steady at about 400 to 500 grams per hour per fisher since 2003-2004, while that in the vicinity of marine reserves is about 1,000 to 1,500 grams per hour per fisher. <br><br>Third, the biomass of target (food) fish species in unprotected coastal areas during the 2000s is about 5 to 10 tons per km<sup>2</sup> in contrast to about 100-150 tons per km<sup>2</sup> inside no-take marine reserves that are fully protected. <br><br>I have not assessed the conditions of fish and fisheries in seagrass beds and mangroves, but they are likely to have remained essentially the same, if not in worse conditions, for the past five years based on the perceptions of fishers and marine biology researchers.<br><br>What can we do to improve the situation of our coastal environments and resources? I say that the most urgent thing for us to do is to increase the area of no-take marine reserves from what it is now by more than 2% every year until we reach the optimum protected area covering 20-30% of the total areas of coral reefs, seagrass beds and mangroves during the next decade. This percentage of fully protected area (from fishing and other extractive activities) is needed to enable our marine biodiversity and habitats to recover their status at the turn of the 20th century.  At this time, some of our reefs destroyed prior to 1972 have not recovered, indicating the extremely slow rate of reef recovery from such destructive activities like dynamite blasting.<br><br>Let us learn lessons from the Australians who have fully protected from fishing and other extractive exploitation 30% of the 350,000-km<sup>2</sup> Great Barrier Reef, and are now enjoying the spillover of fish from the no-take marine reserves. <br><br>We have no other option. If we lose our own reefs, we cannot expect the Great Barrier Reef to replenish what we have lost.  It is too far us. Preserving 30% of our reefs, and for that matter, our total biodiversity, is the only viable solution to our problem of resource degradation. <br><br>As I write this column, I am aware of the opinion of some (e.g. those in a recent publication of the World Bank) expressing doubts on the positive effects of up-scaling the effort to establish no-take marine reserves. On the contrary, I have no doubt that, based on experience and the hundreds of published papers demonstrating the effectiveness of well managed no-take marine reserves, no-take marine reserve establishment is the most significant, single solution to the problem of coral reef degradation in developing countries.      <br><br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Accounting, came with the return of civilian rule<BR><BR>Accountability is the hallmark of a mature democracy. It rests on a bedrock principle: Man must answer even for the last  idle word that he utters. “In all things, therefore, look to your end,” the sages counsel.<BR><BR>President  Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said  adios   in a five-minute  nationwide address.  She stitched in the essential clichés  thanking  for the chance to serve, calling for  national  unity.  “Unite behind our new leader,” she prodded  everyone..<BR><BR>She  burnished her own apples :“37 quarters of uninterrupted economic growth; automated elections, roads and roll-on-roll-off ports, etc. These were   “face of change…Yet, until every Filipino is born to a family free of poverty, we can not rest.””<BR><BR>Of course not.  Economic growth, under her watch, had been “narrow and shallow”. The number locked into poverty  grew from 23.8 million to 27.6 million. From forests, river basins to fishing grounds, the country ecological foundations have been increasingly stressed..<BR><BR>She skipped in her speech  festering   serial-scandals: from the overpriced Macapagal Boulevard to the ZTE broadband scam, unfound  desparecidos, killing of journalists, persistent human trafficking.<BR><BR>Her “midnight appointees” stud  a phletora of agencies. Among these are the Supreme Court, Social Security System, Land Bank, Manila, Cebu and Clark International airports, Pagcor, even the Philippine National Red Cross.<BR><BR>Unannounced, she signed Executive Order 883. This grants  to “lawyers, in the  government executive service, career  service officer rank.”. By a stoke of the pen, Ms Arroyo  bypassed civil service criteria and vested tenure, fattened pay and retirement checks on  government lawyers. Some could be tasked to prosecute her in the future.<BR><BR>“A diminished presidency and heightened expectations is what (she) wants her successor to inherit,” Inquirer columnist Manuel Quezon told the 14th National Press Forum. “In the coming months, landmines left  by the  Arroyo administration will have to be defused….<BR><BR>Will a paalam from the outgoing President do? Look at the track record. Majority of those who collaborated with the Japanese in World War II got off scot free. The Marcoses  were never brought to book for the dictatorship’s plunder <BR><BR>Will she be called to account for her stewardship? What  about family members, notably the First Gentleman? <BR><BR>Anybody recall the pungent remark by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on the proper role of presidential  spouses: “I can trust my  husband not to fall asleep when I give a speech,“ she said. “And he usually claps at the right places”. That’s the English rendering of no basta decir adios.    <BR><BR>By tradition, the  President brings the President elect to the Luneta to be sworn in. By all accounts, this will be a polite but uncomfortable ride towards the historical  Quirino Grandstand. The chemistry between  the two has never been good. Ms Arroyo’s “scorch-earth” aggravated relations.<BR><BR>The ride signals end of the Arroyo era. She denies it. “I will have a quieter public role.”. So do her family and the few friends remaining Rep. Sonny Belmonte seems to have the House speakership wrapped up.<BR><BR>Already, many allies, don’t return her telephone calls.  Politicians in free fall appreciate  best  Charles de Gaulle’s dismissive snort: “The cemetery is full of indispensable men.” Ask  ex-speaker Jose de Venecia and Prospero Nograles.<BR><BR>It need not have been so if, in 2004, she heeded the sage’s counsel: “In all things, look to your end.” There were enough warnings.<BR><BR>The elections had been controversial. Maguindanao, among  others, delivered implausible majorities for Ms Arroyo. A  fragmented opposition couldn’t get its act together. Her strengths stemmed partly from the opposition’s flabbiness. And the “Hello Garci” tapes still hadn’t surfaced.<BR><BR>At the Cebu Provincial Capitol, she took her oath as 14th  president of the Republic. What lay ahead? “If you can look into the seeds of time, / And say which grain will grow and which will not,” Banquo wistfully complained to Macbeth….<BR><BR>People held on to guarded hopes. “In re-election, the President was gifted by abused but patient citizens with a rare second chance to repair the damage on country and its institutions”: noted  Viewpoint (PDI/ June 14 2005). “This is a  time of visitation… but “the window of opportunity for selfless service is rapidly closing …”<BR><BR>What was future then is now history. It does not make for pleasant reading.<BR><BR>Governance yielded to the all-consuming drive to retain power –- from keel-hauling the Constitution, fiddling with emergency rule, keeping warlords bought, rendering  generals pliant and congressmen tame.<BR><BR>The consequences were disastrous.<BR><BR>“Pecuniary decency” became signature of the regime. One’s worth depended on your bank balance. But problems interlock. Budget deficits march lockstep with ecological  shortfalls. Modern diseases surge even as old ailments persist…<BR><BR>Historian Barbara Tuchman called it the “tyranny of the urgent”. The capacity to govern, she said, is sapped by sapped by interlocking crises. Overwhelmed by  today’s demands, few can plan for tomorrow.”.<BR> <BR>The Galilean put it more simply: “You did not recognize the time of visitation.

But such an interpretation would turn a beautiful picture into a vulgar political cartoon, and diminish any artistic value it might have. I would be annoyed by anyone who looked at it that way; that’s not why I took it.<BR><BR>What happened was this:  I was hanging around by the beach one afternoon with my camera and a telephoto lens. I saw a bunch of high school kids walking along the road and I took some shots of them. They walked away and left this girl to find her way home alone.<BR><BR>There’s an ancient Greek myth of the birth of  Venus, the beautiful Goddess of Love.

Victor “Dean” Sinco, {{more}} and it was there that I found him one morning last week, surrounded by Apple Computer equipment and monitors of various sizes, playing with his latest toy,  the Apple Ipad. “This is really cool,” he told me, handing it to me,<BR><BR>“It’s going to change everything in education”. <BR><BR>What I held in my hand was  a bright screen playing an HD movie, in an object made of glass and polished aluminum,  about the size of a sheet of ordinary paper and about one half inch thick. “It weighs less than a pound,” said Dean, “and it can hold a ton of books, and photos, and maps, and anything else— Email, internet downloads;  plus, it’ll run for ten hours on one charge. And it’s cheap! –About $500 U.S.- over a year,  that’s about 75 Pesos  a day; over five years, about 15 Pesos a day! That’s about the same as one of those no-brand laptops that die on you in a couple of months- and this is an Apple product!<BR><BR>“Well,” I said, “it’s a pretty amazing machine, but how can it ‘revolutionize education’ ? “Well,” he said, “think about being able to carry a whole library around with you, inside something you can hold and read like a book, at home, in bed, anywhere. We’re digitizing our entire library here at F.U., and our students and staff will be able to download anything from there through our on-campus wi-fi. Also we have a lot of educational videos on line available for them, plus chat rooms can be set up to take the place of assignment books -- and maybe even some academic counseling.”<BR><BR>“Then”,  he went on , “look at all the books out of  copyright- anything written before 1935- all available for download without royalty. That’s law books, medical books, practically free. The cost of the Ipad is nothing compared to the cost of books like that if you have to buy them. And then there will be  free downloads of books from university libraries all over the world. ”<BR><BR>“Knowing you”, I said, “I’m sure you’ve come to some grand philosophical conclusion from all this.” He laughed. “Well, yes”, he said, “This technology means that anyone in the world can read and learn anything. So learning won’t be  restricted to people in big cities in major countries. People from, say, Dumaguete, will now be able to compete in knowledge with people in New York and Berlin and Paris. It’s the globalization of  knowledge- that’s pretty significant, don’t you think?”<BR><BR>“I’m sure it is”, I said, “my question is, how do you  get one of these things”? “I snuck a few of them in ahead”, he said, “but they’ll be generally available here in July.”<BR><BR>“ We really want to encourage our students and staff to sign on to this technology, so we’re planning to raffle ten Ipads to our students, and hope that others will follow when they see what they can do with this thing.” “Count me in,” I said.  “Sorry,” he said, you’re not an F.U. student. You’ll have to buy one”.<BR><BR>",

Former Health Secretary Francisco Duque is the CESB vice-chair. It has six board members, namely Susan Solo, director IV of the Presidential Management Staff; Angelito Twano, DPWH VIII director; Susana Vargas, deputy executive secretary for finance and administration; Antonio Kalaw Jr., president of the Development Academy of the Philippines; Proceso Domingo, chair of the Philippine Overseas Construction Board; and Jairus Paguntalan, director III of the Customs Investigation and Intelligence Service.<BR> <BR>The Executive Order is perceived by the President’s critics as another attempt to give permanent status to her political appointees and gain the favor of the officials of the Department of Justice.<BR><BR>David said she looks at the move as a bid of Arroyo to ensure her hold on power.<BR><BR>“Magulo yan (this will be messy)”, David said, as she stressed that the instant promotion of lawyers in the executive branch, no matter how low his position may be at the moment, would elevate every lawyer to the rank of a Regional Director, with the corresponding salary increase and permanent status.<BR><BR>“In addition to forcing the government to pay the increased salaries of these lawyers, this will also have a drastic impact on the Government Service Insurance System,” she added.<BR><BR>The EO said that in determining the appropriate CESO rank of the lawyer, the CESB shall be guided by the position of the officer or employee in government, academic honors and distinctions received and his rating in the bar examinations.<BR><BR>Malacañang Thursday said it seemed David was “reading too much” into the executive order.<BR><BR>Deputy presidential spokesperson Gary Olivar said it was possible that Ms Arroyo issued the order because there was a shortage of lawyers in government service.<BR><BR>“The President wants to upgrade the status of lawyers in government service and make it attractive as a career option for lawyers,” Olivar said in a phone interview.<BR>President-elect Benigno Aquino III may revoke the Executive Order on June 30 but he will not be able to revoke the rank, salary and permanence of the government lawyers.<BR><BR>However, a Civil Service Commission Regional Director in Luzon said that they expect the incoming Aquino administration to do something to reverse the Executive Order and its effects.<BR><BR>On Friday, Justice Secretary Alberto Agra said President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo’s executive order conferring the third highest civil service rank to lawyers in government does not give automatic promotions and still requires application.<BR><BR>Agra told reporters in Manila that there was nothing irregular about Executive Order 883, signed by Ms Arroyo on May 28, as it only sought to give the career executive service officer (Ceso) rank to lawyers in the executive branch after due procedure.<BR><BR>“The EO is not a promotion. It’s just a conferment of the Ceso status,” Agra said.<BR><BR>The order, however, did not contain any specific provisions laying down requirements for Ceso eligibility and said all bar passers in government executive offices “shall initially be granted the rank of Ceso III or higher.”<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

George Arnaiz, Perdices’ first exposure was a long day travel Wednesday on an estimated 85 kilometers of mostly rough road that partially comprises the Highway 2000, a project that Macias had conceived years ago to connect Negros Oriental to Negros Occidental via an alternate highway that traverses through the mountains instead of the lowlands.<BR> <BR>A seven-vehicle convoy started the trip with a brief meeting in the morning with officials and barangay captains of Mabinay town, about two hours drive from here. <BR><BR>From Mabinay, the almost eight hours of road travel with a few interval stops began, passing through the villages of Paniabonan and Luyang in Mabinay; Pantiao, Manjuyod; Cabcabon and Nalundan in Bindoy; Candana-ay, Banban and Tambo in Ayungon; Nabilog, Tambulan, Pinalubngan and Guincalaban in Tayasan; Eli, Owacan and Maanlod in Jimalalud, and Pacuan in La Libertad. <BR><BR>These hinterland areas were then hardly accessible with some of them being categorized back in the late 80s as affected by the insurgency. <BR><BR>With the initiative of the late Gov. Macias, the villages of Nabilog in Tayasan and Pacuan in La Libertad now each have a 10-bed Community Primary Hospital, with catchment areas serving not only Negros Oriental residents but also some in the boundary of Negros Occidental. <BR><BR>Perdices and his party stopped at both hospitals to get acquainted with the doctors and the staff as Arnaiz, who also served as governor for nine years, briefed him on the project. <BR><BR>Arnaiz said he accompanied Perdices on the exposure trip as a show of his support to the latter’s commitment to carry on the projects of the late Gov. Macias, who specifically named some of them before he died.<BR> <BR>Aside from the road and hospital projects, Perdices was also brought to the Barangay Agriculture Development Center and Government Agriculture Development Center in Pacuan, La Libertad. <BR><BR>Provincial Agriculturist Greg Paltinca and Provincial Engineer Susano Ruperto were present to brief Perdices on the projects. <BR><BR>On its final leg of the road trip, the convoy passed by a beach resort in La Libertad where Perdices and Arnaiz had a brief meeting with Rep. Jocelyn Limkaichong of the 1st district. <BR><BR>In an interview, Limkaichong and Arnaiz announced they were throwing their support behind Perdices amidst an ongoing controversy over legal issues as to who was to become the next governor of the province.<BR> <BR>Varied legal interpretations have surfaced on whether it was Perdices, as vice governor-elect, or defeated gubernatorial candidate Jose Baldado who should take over the position vacated by Macias when he died. <BR><BR>Baldado, who had already announced he would step down by June 30 after he assumed the governorship, has a pending case filed before the Commission on Elections to disqualify Macias and have him declared the winner instead. <BR><BR>Perdices welcomed Baldado’s announcement as he called for unity amongst politicians in the province as “time is so short and cannot be wasted on bickering” when there is yet so much to do for the province. <BR><BR>Perdices also said he still has to meet with his advisers and other officials on his agenda for his first 100 days in office as governor. <BR><BR>The incoming governor is expected to take his oath twice, first as vice governor and then later as governor, before a mayor and a judge, on June 30. <BR><BR>“It is going to be a simple ceremony with no fanfare,” Perdices said of the oathtaking which shall be held at the old session hall of the Capitol.

Gaudencio Morales, Jr., ship master of the M/V Lorcon Davao, and the Lorenzo Shipping Lines, which owns the vessel. <BR><BR>An incident report at the Philippine Coast Guard in Dumaguete quoted Morales as saying that the cargo vessel was en route to the DUCOMI port in Bacong, a town adjacent to Dauin, when sudden strong gust winds and heavy rains resulted in zero visibility. <BR><BR>The cargo ship was about 50 meters from the shoreline of Maayong Tubig, where many beach resorts and dive shops are located, and had already slowed down its engine in preparation for docking around 9 p.m., said PO1 Revillo Palarpalar, Chief Master at Arms of the Coast Guard here. <BR><BR>Witnesses said they noticed the ship weaving its way inland, prompting them to grab flashlights and spotlights to signal to the vessel to stop as it was entering the protected fish sanctuary.<BR> <BR>Some residents said they feared the vessel would run aground. <BR><BR>Morales claimed that the vessel’s engine was shut down and they had drifted southwest in the direction of Apo Island, however, witnesses said the M/V Lorcon Davao had allegedly remained in the marine sanctuary for about 30 minutes before it departed. <BR><BR>At least 40 floating marker buoys in the protected marine reserve were also damaged. <BR><BR>The Coast Guard report said that Morales also denied that the ship had dropped anchor at the said area, which he did not know was a protected marine sanctuary. <BR><BR>Bigs Eggert, manager of the Atlantis Resort, said that an initial inspection by divers in the area, properly documented with photographs and video clips, said coral formations have been seriously affected. <BR><BR>A table coral of about five square meters was totally uprooted and overturned, she said. <BR><BR>She said the marine reserve in that area is one of the province’s richest fish sanctuaries frequently visited by foreign tourists for diving and snorkeling expeditions. <BR><BR>The Coast Guard granted clearance to the M/V Lorcon Davao, a cargo vessel of about 4,962 gross tonnage to depart the DUCOMI pier around 4 p.m. of Friday. <BR><BR>Palarpalar said the Coast Guard did not have enough grounds to hold the cargo vessel, however, the local government of Dauin had been advised to file a marine protest if warranted. <BR> <BR>Eggert said resort owners and dive shop operators in Dauin were worried about the impact of the damaged corals and fish sanctuary in Maayong Tubig, considering that it would take years to rehabilitate the coral reefs.

All the talk of change, of a new Philippines, of an empowered Filipino, appears to start on the wrong foot. Or is it?<BR><BR>Such is the reality in the Philippines. Despite the rosy outlook painted by the previous administration, unemployment is still at 7.6 percent. That means that more than 2.9 million Filipinos do not have jobs. For those who have jobs, one in five are underemployed. It is not surprising to hear of a college graduate ending up as a clerk or as a saleslady.<BR><BR>Government figures have indicated a sharp lowering of the country's Gross Domestic Product from 3.5 percent in 2007-2008 to 0.9 percent in 2008-2009. Out of these figures, the sharpest GDP decrease was felt in the industry sector, which from 3.1 percent in 2007-2008 went down to -2 the year after. <BR><BR>The economic sunrise for the Philippines today is in the services sector, which almost maintained the same 3.3 percent growth experienced in 2007-2008. This would explain why there is a marked increase in the enrollment for schools offering Hotel and Restaurant Management today. Across the Philippines, enrollment in nursing schools has decreased. It no longer is seen as the path to economic prosperity that it used to be.<BR><BR>To say that Filipinos today need jobs is not an understatement. The reality is that in most areas in the country, the government continues to be the biggest employer. Dumaguete City has over 1800 Job Order (casual) employees as against less than 600 permanent workers. <BR><BR>Dumaguete City, however, may be lucky to host some Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industries. Companies like Teletech, SPI Global, PLDT E-Ventus, Qualfon, to name a few, provide jobs for many Dumaguetenos and pump in more than P20 million of fresh money each month in salaries alone. In turn, the spending power generated by all this cash should translate to more income for schools, restaurants, appliance stores, groceries, entertainment and clothing stores, not to mention the lowly tricycle driver.<BR><BR>Against this background, the government may not be the biggest employer after all. In Dumaguete and Negros Oriental, there's money lurking around in the private sector. Those who have the money must be encouraged to use their money to generate jobs and generate more business. This way, we will lead the other cities in creating positive change for our country. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

The wellness generation.

It is both an inward and outward transformation that is manifested by behavioral change in the way a person adopts a wellness lifestyle.”<BR><BR>As the word wellness implies drastic behavioral change, the meaning projected by the theme is \"change\" or \"transformation\" and a challenge to everyone and for all to meet as a matter of choice, Mequi says.<BR><BR>The second dimension to the theme, he said, is that it jibes with the change advocated by the new administration of P.Noy Aquino, as our new President wants to be called.<BR><BR>“Hence, the call of the times is all about change, transformation, behavioral and systems change.”<BR><BR>And in keeping with this theme, the graduating class of 2014 is adopting the name “Transformers”.<BR><BR>Foundation University, founded on July 4, 1949, will start its 61st anniversary celebration with a Diana on Monday at 4 a.m. at the FU Green fronting the home of University President Dr. Mira D.

This is the National Gallery of  Art in Washington, D.C., U.S.A. – and there are museums like this in cities all over America. There’s nothing “nationalistic” about these collections. They contain famous works from all over the world.<BR><BR>Most  of the paintings in these museums were given to them by rich families from their own personal collections, or were purchased by the museums with money they donated. They gave paintings and money to the museums to make great works available to the public; but also, in competition with other rich families, they gave to increase their own prestige as patrons of the arts. <BR><BR>If, for example, the Kennedy’s were to give a museum a painting worth ten million, The Rockefellers might give a bigger painting, worth twenty million, to show the Kennedys who was The Boss. Childish, but the public benefits. <BR><BR>Nothing like this happens here. It’s not that there are no rich families in the Philippines. It’s just that most rich people here are not interested in donating to the arts; it’s not their style, they would gain no prestige with other rich families from it; and in most cases they don’t know enough about art to do it intelligently, even if they wanted to. So the country suffers not only from economic poverty, but from cultural poverty as well.<BR><BR>Perhaps this man in the National Gallery will be inspired to produce a painting of his own. Or maybe not. But he can hardly fail to gain something in spirit from his visit, surrounded as he is by the greatest works that the human race is capable of  producing. And it costs him nothing. It’s a gift, from those who can afford to give.<BR><BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport7-4-10.jpg\"><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>When Foundation University started organizing sporting events in 2006 with the first staging of the “Rice is Life” Leandro Sinco Challenge Races, it adopted as its institutional advocacy the conservation of rice— “the grain that has shaped the culture, diets, and economies of billions of people in Asia…for them, life without rice is simply unthinkable.” (Asia Rice Foundation website). <br><br>The following year, FU organized the Dumaguete Fiesta Adventure Marathon, the only “rice marathon” in the whole world wherein, instead of the usual cash prizes and trophies awarded to winners, cavans of rice were given. This sports tourism event is now supported by the Department of Agriculture and PhilRice, both leading government institutions concerned with rice production and sustainability. <br><br>FU’s sports programs with rice conservation as institutional advocacy has three sub-projects: a) “Porridge for Children” where hot lugaw and champorado are served, b) “Shoes for Children” where used-shoes are solicited and given to the needy, and c) “Children at Play” where kids regardless of gender, talent, ability, and social status are provided the opportunity to play in consonance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most-signed treaty among member-nations, “guaranteeing the right of the child to play and recreation”. <br><br>This past summer months, in partnership with Robinsons Place Dumaguete, FU staged competitions in basketball, volleyball, futsal, and sepak takraw, right inside the atrium of the shopping mall, participated in by over 500 children from as far as the municipalities of Mabinay in the north and Zamboanguita in the south. <br><br>In all these events, bags of rice, the Golden Grain of Life, were awarded to the participants, to reinforce FU’s institutional advocacy of rice conservation. And it is a source of pride and excitement that what we do, or started to do five years ago, attaching an advocacy to sports undertakings, is in consonance with current developments in sports events staging. Take the following examples: When Former Sen. Robert Jaworski was asked (PhilStar, June 23) about what Meralco should do regarding its entry into the PBA next season, he said, “The team must focus on <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">advocacy</span> (bold print mine) …employ a unique style of sports marketing where an NGO will be the beneficiary…The approach will not be to find a sponsor but to support a beneficiary…for example football’s F.C. Barcelona which supports UNICEF as its beneficiary and carries the UNICEF logo in uniforms, not a brand of a commercial sponsor paying for jersey space. Under this approach, Meralco will donate its share of PBA ticket proceeds to the designated beneficiary.”<br> <br>For several years, I have been criticizing the 34-year old Milo marathon for its lack of a concrete advocacy. I used to say, “Look at Rudy Biscocho (race director and a friend of mine), he makes runners pay an entry fee plus some used sachet of a Milo drink, comes to town to set up his paraphernalia, asks some LGU executives to fire the starting gun, awards the prizes, gathers up his paraphernalia—and leaves town with what? Nothing! No advocacy.” The  Milo marathon comes to Dumaguete on Sept 19. <br><br>But hear this welcome news. “Milo marathon launches advocacy program” (sports page banner, PhilStar, June 29). <br><br>“At last,” I exclaimed to people in my office. And look, (was it said that the best form of flattery is imitation?), the news report said: “The National Milo Marathon kicks off its 34the staging next month with new innovations, including an advocacy to inspire kids to excel in sports by <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">providing rubber shoes</span> (bold prints mine), to deserving public school students across the country…emphasis will be on raising 4,000 pairs of rubber shoes, which will be donated to student beneficiaries, who excel in sports with good academic standing…a portion of the registration fee will be allocated to the advocacy program…” <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">              ***** <br></div><br><br>        <br>I understand the City government of Mayor Chiquiting Sagarbarria is keen on putting in place a sports program that compliments what fellow columnist Dominique Gerald Cimafranca once wrote that a “passion for sports” is one of the notable characteristics of a University Town. It is suggested that a City Sports Council be created similar to the existing Tourism Council. <br><br>If such a plan materializes,it is imperative that a relevant advocacy be adopted to guide the vision, mission, and objectives that the sports council will adopt as bases for programs, projects, and activities that it shall pursue. A sports program without an advocacy will be meaningless and will not be supported. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Emails  on the transition have cascaded .<br><br>“Most of the time we fail our leaders,” wrote  UP graduate Angioline Loredo, now a New York-based executive. “It  is not enough to say: ‘Please, Noynoy, don’t let us down’  It is equally important to say:‘Noynoy, we will not let you down.’ That’s my two cents.” <br><br>Wednesday’s  peaceful transfer  of power  radically differs  from Proclamation 1081 that clamped on martial rule. Street brawls presaged  ouster of  the boozed  Estrada  regime. “By any standard, ( this )  is a momentous  achievement in political stability,” UP professor Randy David notes. <br><br>Since  People Power, the president-elect fetches  the incumbent  from Malacañang, Inauguration spokesman  Manuel  L. Quezon III points out.   Both proceed to Quirino Grandstand, abroad Car No. 1 <br><br>“This may turn out to be the longest ride in their lives”, Inquirer said Aquino  has vowed  to  pin Arroyo for corruption.  She will be “gracious …until the final moments of her administration,” Palace spokesmen insist. <br><br>She had “no choice but to make a virtue of necessity,” commented   W. Scott Thompson of  Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and Oliver Geronilla.. She “decamped” because  all her efforts to retain power – from keelhauling the constitution to co-opting the military – floundered.  “All doors were closed.  Except the “Exit.”… <br><br>The stiff  trip recalls the chilly January 20, 1953 drive from the White House to the U.S. Capitol by  President Harry Truman  and president-elect  Dwight Eisenhower. A  bitter campaign  marred relations between them.  <br><br>“Can I  stand sitting next to that guy?”, Eisenhower wondered aloud  When  the Eisenhowers  picked up the President  at the White House,  they refused to have coffee with the Trumans. Instead, they  waited  in the vehicle. <br><br> A  seething  Truman (gently  prodded  by  his wife) came out.. “It was a shocking moment,.”  CBS correspondent Eric Sevareid  recalls. “The current and future Presidents’ journey to the Capitol was chilly..” <br><br>Even their memoirs differ. But  there is unanimity on one  point.. Who ordered my son John back  from service in Korea?,  Eisenhower asked.  “I did,” Truman replied. , “The  President thought it was right for your son to witness the swearing- in of his father to the Presidency.” <br><br>The  Luneta  program calls for  the  “graceful exit” at 10:55 a.m, of  Arroyo after last  military honors. She shakes  hands with  the President-elect, then  drives away,  in a private car. Arroyo drives to a  ”quieter public role” as congresswoman for Pampanga. <br><br>Is  that possible?  Before leaving,  she booby-trapped everything for her successor. She shoved midnight appointees into every post within reach: courts, government corporations to agencies, not  sparing  even the Red Cross She gutted  the Ombudsman,  civil service, etc. Will  they  serve  as  her praetorian guards  to beat back likely  plunder charges?. <br><br>On Wednesday,  at least, there’ll  be none of  Oliver Cromwell’s brusque dismissal  of the Rump Parliament:  “You have stayed  in this place too long And there is no  health in you. In the name of God, go.” <br><br>At  noon,  Associate Supreme  Court  Justice Conchita Carpio- Morales,.administers the oath to Aquino,.  the first woman magistrate  to do so. This is just   “a minute long” oath, a  Court spokesman shrugged. <br><br>Excuse us.  Behind  the rites  festers  Arroyo’s drive to shred  the constitutional ban on midnight appointments. She rammed through a Cinderella exemption  for the chief justice. Down the road., this issue will mutate in unforeseen forms. <br><br>After Luneta, the mint-new President ascends the grand staircase leading to the Malacanang’s Ceremonial Hall. Juan Luna’s painting, the “Blood Compact  adorns the top of the staircase. President Aquino  enters his new office, swept clean of  his predecessor’s belongings He  inducts the new cabinet.— and confronts stark reality. <br><br>As his mother did before him, Aquino inherits “worsening poverty, pervasive corruption, decades long insurgency, empty state coffers, among other things”, UP School of Economics Raul Fabella said.  “Hope has often  been dashed in this past. There is no guarantee it will end differently this time.” <br><br>We  agree.  No such guarantee, in any case,  is possible.  Nor do ordinary Filipinos  expect such warranty. But are  there some hopeful  differences now?. <br><br>Former senator  Rene Saguisag  articulated one Given the track record, Aquino won’t   loot, as his predecessors did with abandon.  If this comes to pass, that would be one up for the new administration,  he wrote in his weekly column... <br><br>Second, more citizens  realize  that  there are no “messiahs”. After People Power, we left Corazon Aquino to battle off  the piranhas by herself. Citizen involvement is essential  as a “new window of opportunity” opens  for all. Leaders  ”may not claim the ‘divinity that doth hedge a king’, the historian Horacio dela Costa cautioned   at  President Manuel  Roxas’ funeral. “He is held accountable always for the authority he holds in trust. And when his mandate is revoked, he must be willing … to return, as a private citizen, to the ranks from which he came. <br><br>“Let him not expect any reward but the consciousness of having served his people and his God. For often, he will get no reward but this…. Austere are the laurels of the republic.” <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The evening started ca. 5:30pm with a red-carpet lobby arrival of sponsors, patrons, supporters, friends and invited guests. Some were even treated to an on-the- spot interview with Glynda Descuatan. Filipiniana was the suggested attire for the night and seeing the guests all decked up seemed to throw you back in time. But night and seeing the guests all decked up seemed to throw you back in time. But this was tonight, June 25, 2010. It was splendid to see people dressed properly for the occasion. Why Filipiniana? We’ll get to that later. <br><br>Let’s talk about the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">hors d’ouvres... </span>all expertly prepared by Richie Armogenia of the LIKHA fame. We had catalan bread, quesadilla, spicy pork empanaditas and many other wonderful treats but the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">piece de resistance</span> was the oyster wrapped in bacon, placed on top of a simple atsara and individually served on a chinese soup spoon. Scrumptious with a clever presentation. The attendees surely had their fill of excellent <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">hors d’ouvres,</span> good fruit cocktails, good conversation and wonderful music from the SU College of Performing Arts Rondalla.. <br><br>By 6:30pm, we were all asked to go into the theatre proper to watch the first presentation for the evening- a university premier of DUMAGUETE: AN ARTISTS’ HAVEN, a film about art and artists in Metro Dumaguete. The film gave us a historical perspective on the beginnings of art in Dumaguete and how,  thru the times, it blossomed to its richness today with artists from everywhere now living here or wanting to live here. This film made me realize how culture and art are so intertwined with Metro Dumaguete,  something we should all be thankful for. The film was created by Carmen Singson del Prado and we salute her for her great effort and thank her for this wonderful piece of art and we salute her for her great effort and thank her for this wonderful piece of art in itself. I do have 2 constructive criticisms: 1) the film projected on the screen was kind of dark. This may not be how the actual DVD copy is. It could be that the theatre’s projector did not have enough lumens to optimally project a good quality image on screen. 2) in the early part of the film, black and white - strarting in 1901, the yellow captions should not have occupied the center of the picture and not fade out so quickly before one could finish reading it. <br><br>And now, why Filipiniana? Because of the SU-CAC’s first cultural presentation of the 2010-2011 season: HARANA, by the Philippine Opera Company. How could you not dress the part! What a great way to start the season. There were 5 sopranos and 3 tenors all of whom truly deserve their membership to the opera company. They had soaring voices and all individually unique in quality and timbre. They also had the Filipiniana costumes to boot. Near the end of their program, they revealed to us that Harana is a project that was conceived to help preserve our original pinoy music, specifically the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">haranas</span> from days gone by so that it won’t be lost and will be available for our future generations. Kudos to the POC. I talked to three of the artists after the show, offered my congratulations and apologized for the poor sound system we had. They were using wireless headset- mics and in many instances, the artists voices did not amplify well. In fact, their voices sounded ‘metallic’ or the artists voices did not amplify well. In fact, their voices sounded ‘metallic’ or ‘synthesized’, particularly the men’s voices. I also lamented the fact that while they were making their entrance from backstage, already singing, we couldn’t hear their voices and as soon as they got to the middle of the stage, their voices came midstream on a note or a phrase. Seems like the wireless signal was absent backstage. The artists I talked to said they knew about the problems as they were struggling with it during rehearsal. One of them hoped that the sound engineer can fix it before tomorrow’s (Jun 26th) performance. But other than that, Harana is a must see for all Filipinos. My only regret is that considering we are in the Visayas, the POC should have included more visayan harana songs of which there are many that are so beautiful. “Harana” itself is a title of a beautiful visayan harana song. Well, maybe next time. <br><br>Thank you POC and thank you SU-CAC for starting the season with a bang! <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Leo Mamicpic </span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Dumaguete City</span> <br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Leadership by example, and in the history of the public and private life of P-Noy, he is known by his family, friends, allies and associates, as an honest person. Tired of brazen lies and unabated abuse of the perquisites of a public office, the people  chose an honest man to lead this country, as against the other candidates who had a more active political mileage and  better perceived  competence. <br><br>Political analysts have been quick to state that such basic values of HONESTY and INTEGRITY, are good building blocks to restore the damaged social and political structures which had diminished  the mechanisms of democracy. <br><br>Today is the “Fourth of July, and this is the celebration of Independence Day of the United States of America. People who came from Europe, Asia and other corners of the globe decided to create “One nation under God with liberty and justice for all”  in the New World, wherein they established “a government of the people, for the people and by the people”. These were huddled masses who escaped from the oppression of tyrants and kings, who exercised absolute powers, and where subjects can lose his head, upon the whim and caprices of a ruler.  Because of their varying backgrounds and history, Americans are multi ethnic and multi-cultural, but one in making their government answerable to the people. <br><br>Lee  Kwan Yew of Singapore had proven that basic values, HONESTY, INTEGRITY, RESPECT, SELF DISCIPLINE, etc. are the most important buildings block of a strong country. He had shown the way, he has created a stable, modern and economically progressive country, through his leadership by example. <br><br>Like what P-Noy said: “There are more honest people in government service! “, and most of us know that in our locality, we have managed to hold our leaders responsible and honest. <br><br>Today, every citizen is challenged to keep their government officials honest. So, enough with requesting cash for tuition fees, prescriptions, fares, burials, allowances, wedding gifts, etc., because people may be making demands which will force our officials to dip into the public coffers, beyond what is legally budgeted.  Let us all practice responsible citizenship, by not dumping our private financial responsibilities on our government. Let us practice the motto: HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY! <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

We personally hand-carried a letter of concern signed by neighbors to Mr. Mario V. Aragon, OIC of CENRO in late May. We learned from him that there are some documents still to be submitted, as of that time, to fulfill the environmental requirements of the project (e.g., the Dumaguete office has not yet given such a permit, although there is an environmental compliance permit that came directly from the Cebu’s Department of Environment & Natural Resources, and some lapse in pre-project implementation procedures happened (e.g., no public discussion or consultation was held with the barangay that will be directly affected). <br><br>When this letter gets published, it may be too late to do anything.  We who have lived in Tubod for decades have been left only with memories of the sound of flowing water and the happy chatter and laughter of lavanderas that characterized our community before.  Today, we are faced with a graver issue – that of an UNSAFE neighborhood  brought about by the construction of a gasoline station that should never have begun in the first place .<br><br>We have new city officials who were sworn into office recently.  While we congratulate all of them, we hope and pray that they will be more sympathetic and responsive then some officials in the past, and will act on this concern and do something to assure us that our right to a quality of life is upheld. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Jocelyn Somoza de la Cruz </span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">for the Tubod neighborhood </span><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Mcquown, Veterans Service Center Manager at the US Embassy in Manila, said that the USVA “was ready to make a decision on your compensation claim.”<BR><BR>Partlow, without going into personal details on the background of the compensation claim, said that he was given 10 days from the date of the letter to submit additional relevant records if he could obtain these.<BR><BR>The envelope that contained the said letter, with a header that said “IMPORTANT – reply needed”, was stamped March 17, 2010 by the Manila Post Office and was received and stamped at the Dumaguete Post Office on May 19, 2010.<BR><BR>Partlow was unable to reply to the said letter because it did not reach him on time.<BR><BR>A second letter from the VA Office of the US Embassy in Manila, also signed by Mcquown and dated March 29, 2010, rendered a decision disapproving Partlow’s claim for compensation.<BR><BR>The letter was stamped April 4, 2010 at the Manila Post office and arrived at the Dumaguete Post Office and stamped April 23, 2010.<BR><BR>Both letters were not delivered to Partlow until Thursday afternoon, July 1st, by postman Joseph Ojales, whose assignment covers the Bajumpandan-Cantil-e areas.<BR><BR>Ojales explained that the letters were apparently sorted out by mistake and given to another postman, Dennis Catalan, whose assigned area is the adjacent village of Banilad.<BR><BR>The letters bore the Partlows’ address as Lot 1, Bajumpandan-Banilad Loop Road, Dumaguete City, the same address used by the couple in other types of mails from private couriers that were and are being delivered on time.<BR><BR>Catalan admitted that he did not bother to ask Ojales if he knew the Partlows, and instead continued to hold on to the letters for several weeks until Thursday morning when he decided to leave them instead in the pigeon hole assigned to Bajumpandan.<BR><BR>He said he attempted to locate the Partlow residence and after three tries, with notes written down on both letters, finally marked them as “unlocated”.<BR><BR>This is not the first time that the Partlows had experienced delay in the delivery of mails since they moved to their house in Bajumpandan in 2006.<BR><BR>In fact, Partlow’s wife, Judy Flores, had already earlier made arrangements with post office personnel to ensure that they knew where to deliver the mail, and even gave contact numbers to them.<BR><BR>Postmaster Francisco Mapili of the Dumaguete Post Office told reporters that he will investigate the incident and make a report to their head office in Manila.<BR><BR>He admitted that unrecorded mails, such as the two letters that were intended for Partlow, are among the least of their priority.<BR><BR>Mapili said topping the priority list were express mail, followed by recorded/registered mail, and at the bottom are the unrecorded or ordinary mails, costing P9.00 each within the country and to include notices from pawnshops, magazines, postcards and the like.<BR><BR>The US Embassy in Manila has been normally sending their mail to Partlow via the Philippine Postal Corporation’s ordinary mailing services.<BR><BR>Mapili said that ideally, undelivered mail, especially if these have insufficient address or cannot be located such as through the barangay captain, must be returned to the sender within a month.<BR><BR>In fact, a mailman can even “hide” undelivered mail and these could not be verified considering that postmen are required to submit a delivery sheet at the end of the day for registered mail only.<BR><BR>The local postmaster also admitted that he could not ascertain the volume of undelivered mail currently sitting at their office.<BR><BR>Mapili said that he will submit a report for a possible administrative complaint against those responsible for the delayed delivery to Postal Inspector Joseph Guido Pagaran of the Philippine Postal Corporation in Manila.

Shot in Masbate, Pink is the first full length feature shot entirely in the Masbateño language. The film is partly based on real life events, and tells the tale of what families of soldiers have to deal with in times of adversity. Back in 2008, a young boy catches a TV report about a wounded soldier pleading for rescue. That soldier is his father. He and his mother seek help that comes too late. <br><br>Fabillar plays Mateo “Mating” Bolante, brother of Corporal Lino Bolante (played by Allen Dizon). “Mating is a tired student. His family pressures him into becoming a soldier like his brother, but he’s interested in the arts. He sees the kind of stress his brother brings to his family, especially to his young son, every time he leaves for war,” Fabillar says. <br><br>“The greatest challenge of playing a Masbateño was learning the language. The Masbateño language is very different from Cebuano. It’s like a cross between Waray and Kiniray-a. It’s one thing to just memorize the lines, I wanted to learn every inflection, every stress. I took time to have conversations with the locals between takes to get used to it, and say the words as they would say it,” he adds. <br><br>When asked about how he feels about being the first Dumagueteño actor to star in a Cinemalaya film, he says: “I’m very excited! I love films, and I can’t wait to watch all of the entries this year. I’m really just a movie fan who was blessed with the opportunity to act. This is only my second film role, and playing Mating was very fulfilling. When I decided to become an actor, I realized there are two types of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">artistas</span>: The celebrity and the actor. I want to become an actor.” <br><br>He also added he was very excited about working with famed Manila theater and indie actress Angelie Bayani, who plays the corporal’s wife. “Being in the shoot made me learn from her. She’s very humble and her talent is much greater than her.” <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pink Halo-Halo</span>, written in 2004, was Joselito Altarejós final paper in a Creative Writing course at the University of the Philippines. It stars Allen Dizon, Angeli Bayani, Dexter Doria and Mark Fabillar.

They followed the route from Rephidim, arrived at the Wilderness of Sinai, and set up camp. Israel camped there facing the mountain. 3-6 As Moses went up to meet God, God called down to him from the mountain: “Speak to the House of Jacob, tell the People of Israel: ‘You have seen what I did to Egypt and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to me. If you will listen obediently to what I say and keep my covenant, out of all peoples you’ll be my special treasure. The whole Earth is mine to choose from, but you’re special: a kingdom of priests, a holy nation.’ “This is what I want you to tell the People of Israel.” </span><br><br>Our scripture text takes us back to Wilderness of Sinai three months after the Exodus. The Israelites, through the leadership of Moses, miraculously escaped Egypt after over 400 years of oppression.  No one really thought it was possible. How can a powerless people rise with such great faith and courage say to their oppressors, “Enough is enough.” What are the chances of slaves running on foot escape their very angry masters who were riding on mighty chariots?  What are chances of water turning to dry ground so that a families and tribes can walk towards their new life? <br><br>Of course, we all know what truly happened. Remembering the Moses on the day of the Exodus as he pacified his terrified and panic-stricken people, “The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.” (Exodus 14:14) What happened that day became a defining moment in their life as a people of God.  On the day of their liberation, they saw the power of God like never before. <br><br>In Exodus 14: 31 we read, “And when the Israelites saw the great power the lord displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the lord and put their trust in him and in Moses his servant.” <br><br>But unfortunately, friends, people have very short memories.  A research was conducted at the John Hopkins University some years back on forgetfulness. According to the results of that study, there are six things that people forget the most: 1) names; 2) where something is placed; 3) telephone number;  4) words; 5) what was said; and 6) faces. <br><br>We all struggle with forgetfulness.  Forgetfulness is such an ordinary thing that many of us do not realize its dangers.<br><br>Only about 90 days after the Exodus, the Israelites began to feel the pressure and the discomfort of their new-found freedom.  They found themselves in the middle of the fierce and brutal reality of desert life. The scorching heat was slowly affecting their health. Food was scarce. Water was limited. The communal way of life was taking toll on their relationships with each other.  The popuarity rate of Moses was slowly declining as many became suspicious of his capacity and competence to govern them. Factions and divisions were emerging as certain groups expressed their desire to go back to Egypt if only  to save their children from hunger and famine. <br><br>It was under these circumstances that God called Moses again, and gave a very specific message to his people through him.  It was a kind message that God hoped would pacify their hearts and restore their bearing and sense of composure..  ‘You have seen what I did to Egypt and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to me. If you will listen obediently to what I say and keep my covenant, out of all peoples you’ll be my special treasure. <br><br>Interestingly, God chose a very specific image to remind the people of His good intentions for them.  He said, “Do you remember how I carried you on eagles’ wings?” What’s so special about the wings of eagles? What was the reason for the choice of such an image? <br><br>First, it should help for us to know that the wings of eagles are large and extremely powerful.  The wings are so powerful that even without flapping its wings too much, the eagle can to soar to very great heights even in the midst of a great storm. <br><br>The secret is because an eagle waits for the current of wind.  When the wind comes,  it literally rides on it, spreads its powerful wings and allows itself to be carried upward by the wind. Eagles are not like common birds flapping their wings here and there.  Common birds get tired easily but not eagles. Eagles are wise. They wait for the wind and soar with it and on it. The eagle’s wings are also objects of nurture and care, too.  The mother eagle uses her wings to shield, to protect, to defend and to secure her babies from immanent harm and danger. <br><br>In the midst of the dangers of the desert life, the God of Israel reminded his people not panic. God lovingly called them to remember the powerful wings of the Lord that carried them through and protected them from each and every harm. <br><br>Today, we ask each other. Am I in a desert like the Israelites?  Am I becoming weary?  Am I becoming frustrated with the circumstances around me? Do I need to be lifted up? <br><br>God said to his people them…. “Have you forgotten  how I carried you on eagles’ wings?” <br><br>What do we need to remember? We need to remember many, many things how God lovingly provides for our children’s needs; how God saves us from wrong decisions that can destroy our good name; how God makes us whole despite scarcity and limited resources; how God provides true and loyal friends who continue to love us even when we become unlovable; how God vindicates us from our enemies, and how God saves us even from the evil of our own hearts;  how God stretches our faith to extend our reach and service ; how God inspires us to invent and re-invent ourselves in the light of His purposes and not our own agenda or even public opinion. <br><br>Today, God is reminding us the spiritual amnesia is deadly.  Spiritual amnesia causes us to lose our focus on the things that truly matter.  It leads us away from appreciating the beauty of each moment — despite the scorching heat and the glaring dryness. <br><br>Are we ready to ride on God’s wings one more time? The Lord is  inviting us to pause…..to wait for his wind…… to ride his powerful wings so that we can soar far beyond we had thought or ever imagined. Thank you, Lord! <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

It was a regular day—nothing much was of Tokyo for Hokkaido, I was on a train, the Chuo Line bound for Musashi-sakai from Shinjuku. It was a regular day—nothing much was of interest, and I stared blankly into the mass of people surrounding me, thinking only of the bed that waited for me in my dorm room. <br><br>Suddenly, two elderly Japanese women suddenly erupted into a furious catfight, despite the heavy passenger crowd inside the train. It happened in front of me. They went about it in a strange stranglehold— no shouting or screaming, just two women locked in a furious quiet, battling each other. I felt embarrassed for them. And nobody, not one among us, attempted to separate them. <br><br>When the train doors opened at the next station, the wintry air suddenly blasted in, and they both got off in their quiet huff, still clutching each other’s clothes, gripping tight each other’s hair. <br><br>Then the train chugged on, everybody occupied in their own private shells, all in our own journeys to some future where there would soon be an abundance of so much coldness. <br><br>My first sight of snow was from above, up in the air—it was little patches of white sectioned in parts in the vast brown earth below in Hokkaido, as my plane from Tokyo started its maneuvering for eventual landing. Farther on, the white patches spread— and I remember suddenly exclaiming: “It looks like a giant vanilla cake!” They all laughed. <br><br>But it’s true. Snow is the icing of wintry earth, although a more apt laughed. But it’s true. Snow is the icing of wintry earth, although a more apt simile is of a spread of vanilla ice cream over a loaf of rye bread. <br><br>Hokkaido looked as wild as the guidebooks contended it would be: vast pristine forests, frozen lakes, and rolling fields clamor for space, all dwarfing the occasional farm house now buried under several centimeters of snow. The patches snow at first gave way to the greenish brown of wintry land. But one knows the snow eventually wins: going farther inside Japan’s northernmost island region so near Siberia, away from the sea, there would only be stark whiteness. <br><br>From the plane, I expected a nasty freeze to attack every pore of my tropical body. Nothing did. Kitami City, on entry, was sunny, and the snow was crisp and dry, perfect for a snowball fight. After an airport lunch of Japanese curry rice, the trendiest dish in town, we finally went outside to the perfect cold. I stopped to touch for the first time the ubiquitous white, and found that it was what I always thought it would feel like: beautiful but perfectly ordinary ice scrapings from the Big Freezer in the sky. But the beauty of the thing was the shimmering light reflected from everywhere, creating that illusion of snow with a creamy consistency when actually everything is just ice flakes packed tightly together. <br><br>Soon my feet were cold, although I longed to strip off my four or five layers of clothing. Still, at -6°C, it was “too warm” for winter—but I liked it that way. I became slightly disappointed, however: where were the shivers? the blue lips? the frozen eyes? the tongue stuck on frosty metallic surfaces? I was an impatient tropical boy. After four o’clock, however, when the sun began to set, a hard and fast coldness started to creep into our consciousness, just enough to make everyone shiver and whisper in such pious observation of weather: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Samui desu ne?” </span><br><br>During that trip to the northern lands, I was to get in touch with the best of Japanese culture—make some glazed china, go skiing in a mountain resort, make a snowman, learn <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ikebana</span>, go to the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">onsen</span> or hot spring, make rice cakes, wear a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">kimono</span>, ride  a snow mobile, go to a shrine during the New Year, and do para-sailing. I was staying with the Koras, a Japanese family. Both my vacation <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">okasan</span> (mother) and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">otosan</span> (father) were veterinarians, and when I could I was supposed to help out in their downstairs clinic. We lived upstairs. They were an extremely kind and generous <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">kazoku</span>. I conversed with them nightly in broken Nihongo. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Totemo muzukashii desu ne…</span> But I was not supposed to speak English at all. After every spare Japanese dinner, in typical Nihonjin politeness, I’d say: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Oishikatta desu neu. Onnaka ga ippai desu”</span>—although I was still famished. After TV, which I did not understand, I’d excuse myself to my room, but not before sneaking some dried shrimps from a bowl just lying on the kitchen counter. <br><br> I knew I would have a nice <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">fuyu yasumi.</span> I had hoped. The <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">kazoku</span> were Buddhists by practice, and they tried their best to entertain a Filipino boy. But it was also a lonely time:  every night in Hokkaido when I went to bed, I told myself beyond the keen understanding that my spirit longed for home: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I needed this.</span> I coudn’t <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">always</span> be home. I will have a future in stranger lands lonelier than Japan. Melodrama might have defined my nights there, but my reality eventually demanded sense, or at least an understanding of the deeper things that lie just beyond the province of tears. <br><br>It was snowing that last morning of 1997—softly at first, then in a mute frenetic dance that blurred to an icy grayness the surface of the car window. I sat spellbound in my passenger seat, mesmerized by this vision in white. I was, I think, murmuring: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Hajimete, hajimete..”</span> First time. This was much to the amusement of my <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ojisan</span>. The old man was chuckling, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“So desu ka…”</span> as he drove our death-trap of a car around the turns and bends of gravel, asphalt, ice, and snow. <br><br>I found myself drawing figures and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">kanji</span> characters on the frozen window, while Naoki and Nozumi, aged 13 and 9, were fighting over some <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">otamatoshi</span> in the backseat with me. The car radio was blurting out a strange singsong that I could only identify as some <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">furui ongaku</span>. Somehow, it all seemed alien in this Hokkaido landscape—this place could not be Japan! I thought this should be the wilds of some European steppe. <br><br>The snowfall fascinated me because, unlike rain, it is soft and stealthy. It does not announce itself like the dropping pellets of rain; it just sneaks over everything, like a thief of time. For example, the view from the car window, when a moment ago was blue and green was soon transformed into a whiteness you could feel. The whiteness stretched on and on, soon blurring the distinction between land and sky. <br><br>And on and on, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ojisan</span> drove. The drive seemed to take forever. And there was only silence and snow. <br><br>When we arrived at the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">onsen</span>, I thought quickly that it was most interesting. The winding mountain path led us to this perfect hot spring getaway—a common bath of a beguiling rusticity. Soon I quickly find out that everybody went naked together, but I didn’t care, and it was not embarrassing. You won’t have time to mind your own fragile nudity once you step into the boiling water. I remember I loved that hot bath with its fiery 40°C heat. My skin felt tight and supple.  I felt reborn. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ojisan</span> turned to me, and naked and in Japanese, he said, “I know a woman from your country. She is married to a farmer I know. I’ll take you to see her before you leave for Tokyo.” <br><br>In Engaru, a town an hour away from the bright city light of Kitami, I met her. She was a hapless Waray named Divina who was married to mono- syllabic Japanese cow-farmer. I thought quickly that she was probably your typical mail- order bride—a country girl, ignorant, but hard-working, full of hopeful ambition. She had been living in Engaru for nine years, and she told me that she was happy. <br><br>“My husband is good,” she declared to me, after offering me a plate of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pancit</span>, which I swiftly gobbled up. But she also told me horror stories of other Filipinas in the area who kept running away from abusive husbands, who are married to Yakusza mobsters, who work as Japayukis to what she quaintly referred to as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">bodabil</span>. It was the first time I saw such a thing. I’ve heard about these things most definitely—about OCWs, about penpal girls, about exotic dancer, but they didn’t seem exactly real to me. Until then. <br><br>Soon, she had both of us clad in stained overalls and in protective gloves. “I want to show you where I work,” she said. And we stepped out into the snow again and into a dingy place that smelled quite bad. Divina showed me where she worked morning, noon, and night: in a cow barn that smelled of dung, littered with hay and refuse and treated corn. It was an automated cow farm—there were sucking machines milking the cows instead of old-fashioned human hands. But for an hour, I saw her go about her work, I listened to her broken Tagalog and her familiar Cebuano. She told me she just finished the construction of her family house in Samar, and now she was about to send money to purchase the “Frigidaire” and the washing machine her sister was demanding. I looked at her house and saw something very typical for a Japanese small town: a miserable, tiny structure barely consisting of three rooms, warmed only by an old stove placed in the middle of a cluttered living room. This and her dirty barns, and her cow shit, and her eternal snow. I asked her, “Did you expect this life here in Japan?” She smiled and said, “No.” But she had come. She worked hard. She was resilient. <br><br>Later that week, we—my <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">kazoku</span> and I—went to a temple for the New Year, in a tradition the Japanese called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hatsumode</span>, and there I offered my prayers and my wishes to the gods. <br><br>Back in Tokyo, the metropolis was suddenly deluged by thick and unexpected January snow. So thick and so fast that in less than an hour, it covered everything. It was supposed to be the heaviest snowfall in the metropolis in four years. Everywhere, there was a blanket of whiteness that dazzled. But nightfall, it was almost a disaster, but a merry one. Snowmen and igloos were popping out by the scores, all made by eager student hands in my Tokyo university. Elsewhere else, trouble and chaos reigned. Tokyo is a huge maze of a city and imagination alone cannot surpass its monstrous size or complexity. To get from one side to the next would take hours of endless train rides. Trains crisscross the metropolis like blood veins: they are the sole means of transportation by millions of Tokyoites. In Shinkjuku station alone, about 4 million people change trains every day. Trains in Tokyo have never been an image of comfort. In a regular rush hour, they’re hell on earth, with everybody practically canned inside like sardines. <br><br>Now imagine thick snow blocking the railways during rush hour in the evening. Electricity is soon cut off. The trains stop between stations, in the middle of nowhere. The door won’t open. The people inside cannot get out. The people in the stations cannot get in, nor get a ride. Working men and women, high school students—<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">everybody</span> cannot go home or even go eat. Everyone is trapped. That is, until 6 or 7 the next morning. It was really funny listening to the “adventures” of people in call-in radio stations the following morning. The first world and its problems… <br> <br>Much later, I suddenly felt I could do anything. That I could be anybody I wanted to be. Maybe this was my gift to myself in choosing to come here: to have that newfound sense of self long buried by the static of Dumaguete life. Perhaps I found myself by leaving home.<br><br><br><br> <br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

In the 80’s where Madonna and Cindy Lauper ruled, I was the odd one who spent nights listening to the recordings of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Les Miserables, Miss Saigon, Cats, Phantom of the Opera, West Side Story,</span> and so many other popular musicals. I could only imagine how it must be like to be actually there, watching the musical unfold before me on the stage, and soak in all the drama and the heights and depths of a truly passionate performance by professional stage actors and actresses.  I have read of the elaborate sets, the moving and revolving stages, the lights, the full orchestra with their music that could fill one’s soul ... and I could but sigh and dream and imagine! Alas!  Not everyone have the good fortune. <br><br>Music continues to move me.  Even with marriage and motherhood, and all the seemingly endless concerns that life brings to us daily, I still take every opportunity I could get to indulge this one interest that has persisted through the years. Fortunately, the hub of Dumaguete’s cultural soul, the one we simply refer to as “Luce”, is but a stone’s throw away.   <br><br>Thursday, July 1 saw me and my daughter headed towards Luce to watch <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hinilawod</span>, an epic tale of love and heroism, of vanquishing monsters, and adventurous princes whose exploits paved the way for the rising of Panay Island from the sea. I went there expecting an enjoyable night of music of which I was not disappointed. But what I did not expect was the texture and the detail that went into everything! Simply put, the richness of the production left my mouth hanging wide open. It was simply amazing! <br><br>I guess that I had gotten used to the usual productions that we see here in Dumaguete, rich in performances but kind of minimalist in terms of settings. We focus on the performance or the story but everything else that goes around is left pretty much to the imagination. <br><br>But this time around, we walked through dark scary forests and fought horrible monsters. We entered caves and shot down a monstrous flying bat. And we survived a catastrophe which saw people drowning in gigantic waves.  We witnessed everything in vivid color and vibrant sounds. We were entranced by the energy of the entire production as the story was told in songs and dances amid music and sounds made by traditional instruments. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hinilawod</span> was a wonderful experience and should not be missed especially by children who have always wondered how a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">tikbalang</span> looks like.  Too bad the tickets are all sold out. But despair not. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hinilawod</span> will be coming our way again on April 22 and 29, 2011 as announced in its website <a href=\"www.hinilawod.com\">www.hinilawod.com</a>. <br><br>That is something to watch out for, for <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hinilawod</span> is not merely a production wonder.  The epic itself should be introduced to our children as a source of national pride. It is a testament of our people’s creative genius and an integral part of our culture. Furthermore, the epic is a testament that the Filipinos were a far cry from the depiction of an unenlightened race that the Spaniards “discovered” and had introduced to “civilization”. <br><br>On a more personal level, this Broadway dreamer took great delight at having watched Hinilawod as it showed a little glimpse of what a Broadway musical could be like.  Simply wonderful. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Eventually, after 27 years in jail, Nelson Mandela, leader of the colored struggle, became President of South Africa.  Because of his history of suffering, Mandela had a different point of view about what to do when the coloreds overcame the years of oppression.<br> <br>He wanted to unite his people, and rise above the hubris of violence, and move on as a nation. He succeeded because his Truth Commission was about people who were able to have their apartheid stories documented, and was composed of persons in government who were responsible to narrate the facts and circumstances of their participation, and the amends they were willing to make. <br><br>There were forms of restitution -- payment for damages, seeking forgiveness from the victim, prosecution of the hardliners and incorrigibles. <br><br>A similar body was formed in Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge-Pol Pot massacre regime, wherein at least one million people were summarily massacred, assassinated, or executed.<br> <br>      What does P. Noy want to achieve by creating a Truth Commission? The answer to that will determine the nature and mechanism that will empower the Truth Commission to define its duties and responsibilities.<br><br>     Former Chief Justice Davide is in the unique position to view the assignment from a holistic viewpoint because of his personal history as a former opposition leader during the Marcos regime, a trusted ally of the late President Cory Aquino, the Chief Justice appointee of President Erap, presiding officer over the impeachment proceedings, and later, the one who administered the oath to the person (former President Arroyo) who ousted Erap. <br><br>     As usual, Filipinos are saying in jest: “Why do we have to commission the Truth?”, probably alluding to a commission in monetary terms. This is a reaction borne out of the history of flagrant bribery and money politics of the past, which has caused the Truth to be buried. <br>Recall what the late Dean Coronel said: “What truth are you talking about? My truth, your truth, his truth, their truth? Madam, what truth are you talking about?”<br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

He served in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Wall Street Journal</span>’s Washington bureau, until his recent retirement. <br><br>The picture of a  “troubled military resentful of and occasionally rebellious towards civilian authority” emerged over the years, from President Marcos’ imposition of martial law to Gen. Delfin Bangit’s forced bailout from the chief of staff’s post.<br><br>Like many other institutions, residual American culture shaped the AFP. It didn’t build business enterprises and foundations like the Indonesian and Thai armed forces. “There are no expressways in Manila named after revolutionary commanders as in Jakarta,” Lachica points out.<br><br> A generally-unmilitaristic society keep its soldiers in their places, or out of sight.  “Filipino families would be inclined to send their first sons to law school, second sons to medical school, and third sons to the Philippine Military Academy” – until Ferdinand Marcos imposed martial law.<br><br>“Marcos knew his generals only too well.”  He co-opted them with bribes and promotions. Professional soldiers were shunted to ambassadorships, or were reassigned.<br><br>“The Marcos generals became the nouveau riche... in an armed forces sworn to defend the constitution... (they) did not  “actually run martial law. For the most part, they were … virtual pawns at the President’s hands.”<br><br>Ramos offered himself as a model of the soldier-statesman. His reforms dissipated misgivings. He was “less successful at prosecuting long-needed military reforms” though. He coddled coup rebels. Ramos hasn’t given a satisfactory answer why 35 percent share of the proceeds from the sale of Fort Bonifacio property -- then valued at P5.4 billion, or more than $1 billion – didn’t go to AFP modernization.<br><br>By ordering an attack on Camp Abubakar, President Estrada handed the “AFP a wider war.” And the President’s impeachment on charges of plunder gave the military another opportunity to play kingmaker….” <br><br>Gen. Angelo Reyes “might have been induced by Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to undertake mutinous act that helped  make her president.” The account by <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Inquirer</span>’s Amando Doronila suggests, “The circumstances suggest a corrupt bargain that would lend legitimacy to a virtual coup in exchange for rewards for individual officers.” Columnist Rene Saguisag recently recalled the former First Gentleman’s boast “We have back up forces.”<br><br>Former President Arroyo “surrounded herself with retired military officers in a manner that can only be called Marcosian.  The more she and her husband were enmeshed in scandal, the more she… played favorites with generals.” Their truncated service as AFP chief denied opportunity to build a power base.<br><br>President Aquino can insulate the AFP from political entanglements.  The AFP could then focus on institutional rebuilding. It’d give elbow room to focus on basic and changing security missions.<br><br>From a peak of 25,200 members in 1987, communist insurgents are now down to 4,702.  This attrition stems not from AFP’s superior arms but from ‘extinct ideology’, dissipation of the exhaustion grassroots support, and vicious bloodletting between rival factions.<br><br>The Muslim issue ties up nearly 60 percent of combat troops. “No other single factor will affect AFP’s retasking more than untangling the strategic mess left behind by the Arroyo administration. Aquino needs to restart the peace process quickly.<br><br>“There is a serious risk of the Mindanao project drifting into stasis as spoilers see more benefits than rewards in continued stalemate and Manila runs out of patience with a relatively isolated Moro problem.”<br><br>“Indonesia and Malaysia will not be fully rid of its terrorist networks until their safe havens in Mindanao are cleaned out,” Lachica adds. “These maritime countries also depend on each other to contain threats like the booming narcotics trade, people smuggling, and other transnational crimes”. <br><br>If current trends continue, the AFP will lag even further behind Indonesia’s TNI and the Malaysian armed forces. Dwindling US aid revived in 2001 only because the Philippines was smack in the middle of the war against terrorism. President Arroyo stood firm on this issue.<br><br>The default U.S. position should recognize the importance of these security ties, “regardless of how political winds blow in Manila…. No one says this aloud. But the Philippines’ ultimate strategic value is as a potential forward base of operations in the event of hostilities in the Taiwan strait.  U.S security assistance to the Philippines will likely stay at current levels and perhaps even increase.  <br><br>President Aquino  “can start governing ‘with the wind at his back’ simply because Arroyo will no longer be around to feed political uncertainty\".  The AFP can be freer from cooptation by political elites at the end of his term.  Political generals will be quietly retired. PMA will again produce professionals.  Our Lady of EDSA still looks after her people.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Birthdays, weddings, funerals. The time you fell off your  bike and broke your wrist, the time you saw someone and immediately fell in love. <br><br>Perhaps this man, sitting on the boulevard beside the sea, is remembering one of those moments.  Or even random memories: A broken window he saw in a building, sunlight shining on a wet cement street after the rain. <br><br>Perhaps he’s dreaming about the future; things he wants, things he hopes will happen to him someday: marriage, kids, cars, houses; things he hopes will not: poverty, injury, death.  All these hopes and memories, strung together, form a picture of his life. He thinks that picture is who he is.<br>In reality, he’s a man sitting on a wall with the sea crashing behind him.<br><br>We live not in reality itself, but in pictures. Pictures of our own lives, pictures of the world around us that we learned in school and from books and films. Pictures that tell us where we are, in what country, in what city, on what street. “Scientific” pictures, of the sun in the center of the solar system, of the solar system fading into huge galaxies of stars, mixed with fearful pictures of  imaginary alien beings. <br><br>We live inside these pictures. We carry them around with us with such attention that we’re hardly aware of the reality that surrounds us. We actually prefer the pictures. And yet these pictures are not real. They weigh nothing, they occupy no space. <br><br>Reality is all around us, with sun and wind and stars, and we don’t see it, we don’t feel it, we’re lost in it; and we drive our bodies through it automatically, like cars.<br><br>This man, alone and sad, lost in thought by the sea one windy afternoon -- the pictures in his mind are probably more “real” to him than the wind across his face, or the sound of the waves behind him. <br><br>But the world around him is infinite and absolutely real -- although he is barely aware of it inside his little box of pictures. And the strange thing is that this absolute reality is easily accessible to him at any time. He only needs to clear his mind of memories and pictures and look at it. <br><br>There it is.<br><br><br><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport7-11-10.jpg\"><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>Top officials of Dauin, Negros Oriental, fuelled by what they describe as utter disregard for the law by the luxury live-aboard dive yacht S/Y Philippine Siren, announced Thursday they will be imposing a total ban of the said vessel from bringing dive tours to Apo Island and the town’s rich marine reserves. {{more}}<BR><BR>Vice Mayor Rodrigo Alanano said he had already asked Mayor Neil Credo to immediately revoke the special permits given by the town to the S/Y Philippine Siren to operate at Apo Island -- a Protected Landscape and Seascape -- without prejudice to the ongoing investigation of an incident at which the vessel allegedly destroyed a large expanse of coral reefs there. <BR><BR>At the same time, Alanano said he and other officials will be studying the possibility of taking legal action against the captain of the yacht and its mother company for the destruction. Alanano has invoked the town’s power and authority over Apo Island as part of its territorial jurisdiction even though management of the island has been transferred to the national government. <BR><BR>After Apo Island was declared by the national government as a Protected Landscape and Seascape in 1994, a Protected Area Management Board (PAMB) was created to oversee the affairs of the island. Alanano has slammed the PAMB for alleged lapses and failures to do their functions in managing Apo Island and is also demanding an explanation as to why the LGU was not informed about the destruction of the corals that happened two weeks ago. <BR><BR>What had sparked the stringent moves against the 40-footer dive yacht operated by Worldwide Dive and Sail was the vessel’s return to the island on Tuesday and Thursday this week despite a suspension order issued by Protected Area Superintendent (PASu) Viernov Grefalde last June 28. The order prohibits the Philippine Siren to moor/operate within the jurisdiction of the Apo Island Protected Landscape and Seascape pending ongoing investigation. <BR><BR>We want to send out a strong and clear message to divers, dive shops and dive tour operators and the public that we mean business, said Alanano, in saying he wants a total ban of the yacht from Dauin’s marine territory. <BR><BR>Last June 25, an estimated 76 meters in length and two meters in width of coral formations were destroyed after the yacht, which was dislodged from its mooring buoy, dragged a large coral head across the bottom of the sea. <BR><BR>Mario Pascobello, chief of the Bantay Dagat (fish wardens) of Apo Island, said that <BR>the coral head served as the sink of the mooring buoy, the latter of which was not even designed for large boats like the Philippine Siren. <BR><BR>According to Pascobello, he called for a conference with the ship captain, island village chief Liberty Rhodes, and a representative from the Worldwide Dive and Sail, a certain Marcos Santos, upon noticing that the Philippine Siren had returned again to the island Thursday. <BR><BR>Pascobello said he asked that the yacht immediately leave the island or else he would call in the authorities. The yacht left around 11 in the morning and was monitored sailing off towards Cebu by reporters who were in town to interview Dauin officials then. <BR><BR>Pascobello said he is supporting the move of the town officials in totally banning the yacht from coming to Apo Island. <BR><BR>Officials are now gathering documented evidence of the destruction in Apo Island and are working closely with Danny Ocampo, a campaigner for Greenpeace in Southeast Asia, who had taken underwater video footage of the area that was damaged. <BR><BR>Ocampo told this reporter he will be going back to Apo Island soon to further conduct his own investigation into the incident.

He pitied the straining creature so he did what every Good Samaritan would do... he helped it out to ease its passage from the dark confines of the cocoon into the bright new world that awaits it.  <br><br>I guess that we all know what happened next.  The butterfly’s wings became crippled because of the man’s kindly efforts.  Unbeknownst to him, the poor creature had to go through that painful process. The butterfly needed to struggle out of the cocoon so it could emerge whole and capable of flight.  The article went on to explain how this story is an analogy of every parent’s primordial instinct to shield their children from every hardship that would come their way.  There is no argument against that.  <br><br>As a matter of fact, this very instinct is what guarantees the survival of our race.  But as we all know, too much of anything is not always a good thing.  As in the case of the man and the butterfly, a loving parent wanting to show his love through every means possible, including easing the way for his child and doing everything he could to spare his little one from going through the same struggles and difficulties he grew up with, might be doing his own child a great disservice. <br><br>For he may not know it yet, but he might be raising a spineless individual, one who, not so unlike the flightless butterfly, is incapable of standing on his own two feet.  <br><br>I read this article from the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Readers’ Digest</span> when I was in college, a time in my life when it felt as if things could not get any worse.  To put it simply, life was very, very hard. From a relatively privileged childhood where everything got done for me by other people, I suddenly found myself living in Manila in a cramped rented room, and sharing a dilapidated house with three other families. Money was very scarce.  Every food on the table was a result of my father’s mighty struggle for survival.  And on those times when there were none, we would walk over to a nearby used clothing store and sell off our own clothes. Then we’d have rice to cook. <br><br>The circumstances surrounding my life may have been the reason why I never forgot the butterfly’s story, and why I made the resolve to learn its lesson: Don’t fall into the parental love trap.  <br><br>The word “trap” is always bad, and so it is when, loving parents as we are, we want to do everything for, and give everything to our children to make their lives as easy and as struggle-free as we could make it.<br><br>And how does this translate into my being a mother? Of course, like every doting parent out there, I would never wish the life I had on my only child. But I keep reminding myself that that very life that I pray she would never get a taste of, was the very same life that moulded me into the kind of person I am now.  <br><br>I am a survivor. I came out of it a much stronger person. Circumstances forced me to learn early on that our parents cannot provide for all our needs all the time...that we cannot, and should not expect other people to take care of the same for us...that later in life, when we grow up, we will have to work hard for all our needs and wants.  <br><br>And so my daughter began her training on independence and self-reliance as a baby who was still learning how to walk.  I was always beside her, ready to help whenever she needed me. But oftentimes when she would fall, and I knew that she could get up on her own, her mama just stood by and watched her proudly as she struggled back to her feet. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Lesson:</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Rely on yourself. You can do it.”  </span><br><br>Abby’s training continues until now. She has to work hard if she were to get what she wanted. With God’s grace, hers will be a different form of struggle. I pray that she will never have to experience hunger or deprivation, but learn the value of hard work...she must! <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Lesson: “Things do not come for free. You have to work hard for them.”   </span><br><br>Of course, there are things that I provide to her freely – but these are things that are intended to equip her for life ahead: her needs.  <br><br>Staying true to this course is also a struggle because as a mother, the desire to shower my only child with all the pampering and material comforts I could muster is understandably strong.  But I try to stay on course by looking around and seeing the children who have been crippled by their parents’ great love.  <br><br>I see grown-up sons, married and with children, still living with their parents and relying on them to see to their own children’s every need.  I see young men whose needs have always been provided for by doting parents, too lazy to fend for themselves, and resorting to theft and drug peddling for its easy money when the parents were no longer there to provide for them.<br><br>I believe that it is the little things that matter.  In Abby’s school (Catherina Cittadini St. Louis School) for example, Sr. Marissa, the principal, has always encouraged the children to take their bags to their classrooms by themselves, and not to rely on their parents to do it for them.  <br><br>I am certain there are parents who oppose this policy under the mindset <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Why let my child do it when I can do it for him?”</span>  I could only hope they would see how this little act can go a long way into forming their children’s character.  <br><br>We can’t love our children enough. Or to put it in another way, there is no such thing as too much love. Our love has no bounds, but I also believe that too much pampering does not always translate into loving the child.  This mother believes that letting a child taste a little hardship or inconvenience to prepare him for what lies ahead is a form of loving that no child should go without.<br><br>Unlike that man with the butterfly, we should not make life too easy for our precious ones, lest we cripple their wings, and miss the chance of seeing them take flight and soar.<br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

When it’s good, it blows our minds and makes us reach deep within ourselves, asking questions about this and that. It transcends its inherent strangeness—<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">and all performance art is strange</span>—and makes the familiar both unfamiliar and intimate at the same time. <br><br>But when it’s bad, you feel like a monkey’s uncle. <br><br>Once in Hayahay, I had to sit through a turgid piece by some performance artist from Manila, whose work consisted of reading aloud to the microphone entries from the Webster’s Dictionary. It’s not that I didn’t get it: it was just a bad piece, a complete waste of time—and like the worst of junk art, it didn’t give us anything new. “If I wanted to get the definition of the word ‘ghastly,’ I’d be home and find my own dictionary,” I told my companion. “I didn’t have to come here all the way through the rain, with an order of beer.” <br><br>But all performance art always courts the tricky borders of ghastliness and transcendence. Some do it though with the command of the true artist. I know the writer Vim Nadera does his performances with much wit and aplomb. In Dumaguete, there is Tara Ilic whose feminist moanings are designed to make the hair at the back of your neck stand. <br><br>There have been a lot of performance artists whose place in the world of art is now part of history: Yves Klein, Japan’s Gutai Group, Joseph Beuys, Allan Kaprow, and the controversial Carolee Schneemann. They all have put their distinct signatures to the art form—which is an inevitability—but all subscribe to the general definition, here provided by Wikipedia, of the art “in which the actions of an individual, or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work, and can happen anywhere, at any time, or for any length of time, involving any situation that involves four basic elements: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">time, space, the performer’s body, and a relationship between performer and audience.” </span><br><br>Let me give a popular example. In 1975, the great performance artist Chris Burden unveiled one of his most well-known works, in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Doomed</span>, in which he lay motionless in a gallery at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. He was under a slanted sheet of glass with a clock running nearby. <br><img src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Tempest1.jpg\" align=\"LEFT\" border=\"0\"><br>The hours passed. People were beginning to be worried—Mr. Burden had not had any food or water or any break to relieve himself. What the museum administrators did not quite know was that Mr. Burden hatched the idea for the piece that he would remain, “doomed,” in that position until someone or something would interfere in some way. <br><br>The film critic Roger Ebert writes of that event, where he quotes museum curator Alene Valkanas: “’The piece ended at 5:20, 45 hours later… We felt a moral obligation not to interfere with Burden’s intentions, but we felt we couldn’t stand by and allow him to do serious physical harm to himself. There was a possibility he was in such a deep trance that he didn’t have control over his will. We decided to place a pitcher of water next to his head and see if he would drink from it. The moment we put the water down, Chris got up, walked into the next room, returned with a hammer and a sealed envelope, and smashed the clock, stopping it.’ The envelope contained Burden’s explanation of the piece. It consisted, he had written, of three elements: the clock, the glass, and himself. The piece would continue, he said, until the museum staff acted on one of the three elements. By providing the pitcher of water, they had done so. ‘I was prepared to lie in this position indefinitely,’ he wrote. ‘The responsibility for ending the piece rested with the museum staff but they were always unaware of this crucial aspect.’ <br><br>‘My God,’ Valkanas said. ‘All we had to do was end it ourselves, and we thought the rules of the piece required us to do nothing.’” <br><br>It blows the mind. But while performance art has become a mainstay in the world of art in general, in terms of popular acceptance and visibility, it still has to take its roots in the culture of Dumaguete. In that sense, the city is “ripe” for a good introduction into the best of local performance art, with Russ Raniel Ligtas of Cebu City and Razceljan Salvarita of Bacolod City and Dumaguete. <br><br>Mr. Ligtas is a visual and performance artist who regularly performs with Cebu’s only performance art group XO?. His performances involve dance, costuming, and pop culture elements. He writes poetry and other creative text and is a member of the Cebuano writer’s group Bathalad Inc. <br><br><img src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Tempest2.jpg\" align=\"LEFT\" border=\"0\">Mr. Salvarita, on the other hand, is a member of a family of artists based in Bacolod, but is now based in Dumaguete City and Bali, Indonesia. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Mass Communication at Silliman University, where he also later pursued a master’s degree in Environmental Policy. Razcel, perhaps Dumaguete’s fast- rising young visual artist is also a writer, a photographer, a performance artist, an environmental activist. He is best remembered as the person whose body was painted white and then who walked around Dumaguete semi-naked to call attention to his “Save the Balinsasayao Twin Lakes” campaign. He has also founded the collective art group Artantrum. <br><br>On 16 July 2010, each one will present a suite of three performances, alternating with each other. The combined work, titled <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Russ/Raz: A Duet in Performance Art,</span> is sponsored by the Silliman University Cultural Affairs Committee, and will be performed at the Claire Isabel McGill Luce Auditorium Lobby at 6:00 pm.  It is open to the public, and they are prepared to blow our minds with this duet of strangeness involving body and time and space and us, the spectators.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

I know City Youth & Sports Director Jose “Joe” Guirit is the organizer of the local Milo Marathon, assisted by DepEd personnel, and since this tragic happening was not published in the tri-media, but reported only in several marathon running websites, I hope Joe will take all the necessary precautions to prevent a similar incident from happening in our locality initiated five years ago. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Remus Fuentes died of multiple organ failures as a result of heatstroke two days after he ran the 21K in the recent 34th Milo Marathon last Sunday, July 4, 2010. His death was the result of fatal mistakes, sheer incompetence, and gross negligence in the event organized by the organizing team. In marathon, the risk of heatstroke is much higher for the following reasons:</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“1. The long distance runner aims for shorter time as a goal and therefore motivated to keep a sustained effort…</span> (I always advise runners to have fun and enjoy the run. I discourage any attempt to improve one’s personal best or personal record. In fact, I tell runners to run slow, “the slower, the better”).<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“2. Furthermore, the target minimum time set by the organizer adds more to the motivation to run faster. The cut-off time added more pressure to the marginal marathon runner, meaning if you are used to run above the target time, the tendency is to do better time, probably at pace unproven by your body in practice. Milo Marathon set the target for 21K medal at 2 _ hours or less. Remus collapsed at near 20th km. with a time of 2 hours and 10 minutes when his previous record was 2 hours and 27 minutes.</span> (I am against prescribing a “curfew” or cut-off time for runners. We always wait for the last and slowest runner to cross the finish line).<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“3. The more critical factor is that the hydration management is not in the control of the runner. He has to rely on water availability at the water stations provided and planned by the organizer along the route. In this 34th Milo Marathon, several runners including Remus brother, Roy and Remus running buddy asserted that practically there was no water to drink in the last two to three kilometers before the finish line, a fatal failure for Remus by the organizer when they changed the route resulting in over-traffic near the finish line. There were a record of 28,000 runners on that day and obviously, the organizers failed to anticipate the complexity of hydration .Milo ’s last year marathon participant was well below 10,000 runners. </span><br><br>(Adequate drinking water along the route is the most difficult requirement to meet in marathon organizing. I suggest that Joe Guirit will enlist the assistance of the City Fire Department to ferry drinking water along the route and to stand by in case water stations run dry). <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“4. The correct life-saving response for heatstroke depends on few knowledgeable people who may happen to be around the person. To mitigate this, the organizer deploys ambulances with water and ice for cooling heatstroke victims and is expected to respond within minutes. In addition, marshals are provided along the route to assess runner situations continuously. Obviously, the organizer failed again on this aspect because Remus was helped by policemen and his buddy instead. By this time, Remus is probably already brain damaged as evident by his seizure at the hospital. No Milo people knew of Remus case on that day until Roy, his brother, sent an email informing the organizer of the incident in the next morning. </span><br><br>(In the last staging of the Buglasan run from Sibulan to the Capitol, I was one of the volunteers at the finish line. The race started late, and one girl crossed the finish line showing symptoms of heat stroke. I guided the girl under the shade of a tree, made her lie down on the ground, and ordered that pails and pails of water be poured all over her, soaking her entire body. She recovered after some 20 minutes of this treatment. I suggest that ice be provided at the finish line, and even several electric fans/blowers to cool off runners after the run).<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“5. The sun factor adds to the danger in marathon. Running under the heat of the sun in tropical country like ours cannot be underestimated. To minimize the effect of the sun’s heat, Marathon run is planned to finish in the early morning avoiding the heat at later time. Organizers usually take this into consideration. Milo organized the 21K to start at 5:30 am, a departure of common practice of other marathons that start at 5:00 am. Remus collapsed at about 7:57 am. Roy, who is a better runner than his brother Remus, complained that it was unusually hot that morning even if he was able to finish it earlier in two hours 45 minutes.” </span><br><br>(Marathon running, and any long distance sport events for that matter, should start early in the morning -- and on time. I understand that the annual Sandurot bicycle race starts quite late in the day. Fortunately, in our duathlon race last July 11, except for a few bikers, most of them reported on time for the 5:30 am start of the race).<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Clearly, marathon is an extreme and dangerous sport even to the young, healthy, and trained runners. This is not the “fun run” many people are confused of. The organizer has clear life-and-death responsibility to make sure the conditions the runner will run are done properly. Obviously, they did not do their job properly in the 34th Milo Marathon. In my opinion, being the father of Remus, Milo marathon organizers have failed my son. It is their sheer incompetence and consequently, the gross negligence in their duty that resulted in the death of Remus.”</span><br><br>My final recommendation is for the City and Provincial Youth & Sports Development Councils, from now and up to the just before the date of the Milo Marathon in September, to conduct an information-education-communication campaign among the participants of the race. And it would be even be better if they partner with the Department of Education Provincial and City Divisions in organizing a running clinic that will prepare the participants for safe and successful road racing. The tragic incident narrated above is preventable. I hope the local organizers will avoid the mistakes committed by the race organizers in Metro Manila.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

It's a no-brainer why labor will always want a wage increase while management will always find ways to prevent one.<BR><BR>The Arroyo administration, after all, had trumpeted a 7.3 percent economic growth in the first quarter of 2010. Exports grew by more than 30 percent. Same with sales of cars and motorcycles. But in Dumaguete and Negros Oriental, all we've seen so far are the mushrooming of stores, restaurants and hotels, supporting the retail economy.<BR><BR>Well, yes, the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector has shown some growth, which, in turn, supports the services sector.<BR><BR>But where is the money for the workers in the Industry and Agriculture sectors, which in 2009 grew only by -2 and .1 percent respectively? It would be difficult to mandate a wage increase in these sectors, as to do so would be akin to squeezing blood from stone.<BR><BR>The task of improving the lot of the laborers is not a job of management alone. Government has to do its share in ensuring a better life for everyone -- in the delivery of basic health care, education, infrastructure, disaster preparedness, and improved food production.<BR><BR>The government had promised five million jobs in 2010. That would be more than enough to employ the 2.8 million unemployed Filipinos as of January. But in April, the number of unemployed increased by 200,000, bringing the total number of unemployed people to three million. And we're not even talking of the underemployed, which number 20 percent of the workforce.<BR><BR>So the pressure to produce more money for the family falls on the people who remain in the workforce. And, in turn, they ask their employers to increase their pay because times are getting harder. The demand for a pay increase could be up to P128 across-the-board.<BR><BR>What to do? Should management come to the rescue at the risk of sacrificing profitability? <BR><BR>Perhaps, government should be made to account for their broken promises before any wage hike is considered.<BR><BR> <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

Emilio ‘Dodo” Macias II, and will probably be realized and completed during the term of Governor Tuting.  <br>          <br>This is significant because Governor Tuting is showing he is of the new wave of socially-responsive politicians, holistic and altruistic in his commitment to sustainable development. <br><br>He will not abandon projects just because another politician had started it.  He will evaluate a project, and push through what is good for the many. <br><br>This kind of leadership is new and innovative, as shown in his sorties to the municipalities, the lying-in clinic in Bacong with the cooperation of Mayor Lenin Alviola, inspection of the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital with Dr. Felix Sy acknowledging the support of Governor Perdices in the proposed expansion building,  and the programs in the 1st District together with Cong.

They walk through enormous empty spaces, gigantic rooms, with endless brickwork and polished tile beneath their feet, all enclosed within huge bright cement walls 10 times their height, a thousand times their weight. <br><br>All the surfaces they encounter are hard and unyielding to the touch, concrete, glass, metal, brick. Mansion or nippa hut -- wherever these boys live, certainly does not resemble this place. It was not designed with them in mind. It was not designed with anyone in particular in mind.<br><br>Coming from America, malls are impersonal spaces designed to attract generic consumers. The concept was so successful that they have sprouted all over the world in more or less the same form. They are cool, clean, spacious, simple in appearance, easily accessible -- like cell phones and computers. And together with cell phones and computers, they form the universal look of modern life, no different in New Jersey, New Delhi, or Negros Oriental. The people walking about in them all look about the same as well, most of them wearing the standard world uniform of  <br>t-shirts and jeans. <br><br>But people around the world are not the same. In spite of “globalization”, what people want and think and do in New Jersey is very different from they do here. These boys go to the mall, and use their cell phones and computers in these huge spaces at high speed -- not to search for new information or discuss world events, but to say the same things, make the same arrangements they always did in Dumaguete.<br><br>Even so, they are increasingly attracted by an environment that has nothing to do with who they are, and they are lost in it. What this will do to their thoughts and feelings as they grow up is hard to say.

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>Caves have always fascinated people. In the past, especially during wartimes, caves were used as hiding places from enemies. People explore caves in search of buried treasures or to gather guano fertilizer. In the Philippines, vandals have invaded caves to collect stalactites and stalagmites for sale as decoration materials. Spelunkers have explored caves for recreation. In rare instances, people have used caves for worship. Presently, caves have been promoted as tourist attractions. <br><br>But the scientific study of caves, speleology, have attracted fewer academic people, and cave studies are not popular even among professional biologists in the Philippines. Among those studying caves are biologists interested in specific groups of vertebrates. Mammalogists, ornithologists and herpetologists have been studying cave fauna in the Philippines for some time. More recently, biology faculty members of some colleges and universities have explored caves for their vertebrate and invertebrate faunas under the Commission on Higher Education program on biodiversity. Initial results seem promising.<br><br>Scientists at the Philippine Museum have made diggings in some caves in Quezon, Palawan to study fossils and archaeological artifacts during the mid-1900s. Dr. Robert Fox and his colleagues traced the history of the early human populations that migrated to the Philippines from Borneo during the period of maximum regression of the sea 20,000 years ago. At least another American paleontologist studied the hard parts of animals used as food by these early human cave dwellers.<br><br>During the past 60 years, Silliman University biologists have been exploring the mammal, bird, reptile and amphibian faunas in caves in the Central Visayas. Thus far, one new species of fruit-eating bat (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dobsonia chapmani</span>) has been found in caves in southern Negros. This species is no longer found in caves, its original habitat, in the 2000s, but a remnant population in southwestern Negros has been found living in trees with thick growths of a species of aerial ferns, probably as a result of the disturbance of their cave habitats by humans. This fruit bat is really an endangered species.<br><br>Among the herpetofauna, which includes snakes and lizards, are frogs mostly belonging to the genus <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Platymantis</span> (Family <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Cerobatrachidae</span>). Thus far, four species, all new species, have been described, and at least two more possibly new species have not yet been studied or described, and most probably more will turn out to be new from more caves as yet unexplored. Lizards of the genus <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gekko</span> include a couple of species, which need systematic reviews of their phylogenetic positions in evolution. <br><br>It is not yet clear whether these four described species of forest frogs and others still to be described, as well as the geckos, evolved in the caves they now inhabit or they evolved in forests around these caves but expanded their populations to cave habitats. From what we know about the Philippine environment, tropical rainforests used to occupy some 80-90% of the land area of the Philippines in the remote past before humans settled and cleared the forests. More studies are needed. But it is clear that the described frog and reptile species occupy only the first 10m or so from the cave openings, making it probable that the range expansion hypothesis is what actually happened. Further, all these cave species do not show reduction or lack of normal eyes, which are characteristic of cave species that evolved inside caves.  <br><br>Whatever is the explanation, it is clear that some cave species, notably the insectivorous bats and swifts that live in caves are very useful to the ecology of cultivated species used by humans. These bats and birds feed on millions of insects, some of which are pests, and convert them to guano used for fertilizing the farms. This fact is lost to many of our people who persecute these lowly creatures by killing them directly, disturbing them, or destroying their cave habitats.<br><br>It is time to rethink and change human unkindness to our fellow creatures. I suggest that our environmental advocacy groups add cave animals to the list of creatures worthy of saving for the future. <br>   <br>     <br>    <br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Rudy Romano, a Redemptorist father and human rights fighter, was abducted by armed men of the deposed Marcos regime on July 11, 1985.”<br><br>“The day the marker was installed, 6,000 watched the reenactment of the priest’s abduction,” <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sun Star</span>’s Lorenzo Ninal writes. “Occasionally, somebody stops by, says a short prayer, and drives on.” But most of the time, the place is where jeepneys stop to pick up passengers.”<br><br>Back in July 11,1985, a white Cortina sporting a government license plate, blocked   Father Romano. Armed men on two other motorcycles swerved in. They bundled the priest inside the car and sped away.  <br><br>There has been no trace of Father Romano since, like most other of the “disappeared”.  None has been convicted. Filipino communists shrug aside pleas from relatives of victims in their pogroms.<br><br>What does this all mean?<br><br>“A nation in search of Father Rudy, is a nation in search of itself,” Mary Aileen Bacalso of the Asian Federation Against Disappearances wrote  earlier. Over 1,716 similar cases, spanning five administrations…is a wounding reminder of our callousness.” <br><br>Yet, hope is resurging. At his first military command conference, President Aquino underscored respect for human rights. <br><br>“With the new Aquino administration, there’s fresh hope that justice will be served and truth will finally come out,” Fr. Ricky Acero said. There had to be “closure” for the Redemptorist community to move on in their work among the poor.<br><br>Forgiveness, however, does not extinguish accountability. “Men are unable to forgive what they can not punish,” Hannah Arendt stresses in her essay on Nazi terror. <br><br>Was Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez listening? She’s reeling from charges of misusing her office to shield former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and spouse against  sleaze charges: from the ZTE broadband scandal, to rigged road construction bids.

   "body": "Elementary school teacher Sheila Estonilo picks up a piece of chalk and prepares to write on the blackboard in her classroom when a gangly hand goes up near the back of the room. “Ma’am, may I go out, Ma’am?” a small voice belonging to a skinny boy pipes up. Sheila turns around and nods her head. As the boy rushes out of the classroom, Sheila sighs, knowing that it will take some time before the boy comes back to class, as has always been the case when her students ask to be excused to go out of the room to answer the call of nature.{{more}}<BR><BR>Salag Elementary School, which stands along the highway of the sprawling Siaton town in Negros Oriental, a province in the Central Visayas islands of the Philippines, has long had a problem with a lack of adequate toilets. The school only had two comfort rooms, one for the boys and one for the girls, which are not enough to accommodate a student population of more than 100.<BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Salag.jpg\"><BR>As the waiting lines outside the comfort rooms grow, most (those who could not hold it anymore) run to nature - the nearest bushes - to literally, answer the call of nature.<BR><BR>Teacher Sheila says this is why students take a long time to get back to class. Once they step outside the classroom to do their business, the students tend to loiter and dilly-dally long after they’re done doing their business. “We have no control of where they will go after they ask to leave the classroom. The students often take their time before coming back to the classroom, missing out on a lot of the day’s lesson,” she said.<BR><BR>But things changed when Unicef stepped in to address the school’s problem. Teacher Sheila still remembers the day when officials from Unicef came to their school to deliver free goods as well as the good news. “They gave us books and notepads for the students and told us that they will give us comfort rooms. We were so happy when we heard that,” she recalled.<BR><BR>After the dust settled from months of construction work, year 2009 saw all seven classrooms in Salag Elementary School each outfitted with brand new and sparkling white toilets. Because of this, Salag’s students not only learned proper sanitation and hygiene, but also improved their participation in their classes.<BR><BR>“Now the students don’t need to step out of their classrooms when they have to go to the toilet. Loitering students during class hours is no longer a problem,” Principal Millard Merced happily said, as he pointed out how helpful the toilets have been to their school.<BR><BR>The provision of toilets is one of the many projects carried out by Unicef in elementary schools belonging to disparity villages in the province to promote school sanitation and hygiene. One of the requirements cited in Unicef’s Child-Friendly School System is for the school to be “healthy” with adequate sanitation and toilet facilities. To date, six elementary schools in disparity villages across the province are now enjoying the sanitation, and privacy, provided by clean comfort rooms, courtesy of Unicef which supplied the toilet facilities. The local government units, in return, shouldered the cost of construction.<BR><BR>But it was not a happy ending yet at this point for Salag Elementary School. After the toilets were completed, the school faced another problem: water has long been and continues to be a dilemma for the school and the entire village. “Now that we have the toilets from Unicef, we have to deal with the problem of lack of water. We don’t have a water supply coming in from the main line,” lamented Principal Millard.<BR><BR>Although the village has a water source, the supply is not sufficient to address the water needs of the village residents. But this did not stop Principal Millard who was determined not to let the toilets go to waste. So he called for a meeting with the teachers and together they came up with an idea to solve the lack of water in the toilets. However, the solution they thought of can only be done with the support from the parents of the students.<BR><BR>So in the next Parent-Teacher Homeroom meeting, Principal Millard presented the solution before the parents: for each parent to contribute money for the purchase of containers of water in each toilet every school day. The principal was not sure if he could convince the parents. With Salag tagged as a disparity area, life in the village is hard and water is scarce and expensive.<BR><BR>But to the principal’s surprise, the parents readily said yes. Now, with the parents chipping in the funds, each classroom’s toilet has up to five gallons of water, enough to address the sanitation needs of around 60 students in each class. All this made possible by the bayanihan spirit among the Salag villagers. Bayanihan is a Filipino term referring to a spirit of communal unity or effort to attain a particular objective. In this case, the objective was to make sure that Unicef’s efforts are not wasted and the students in Salag get to use the sanitation facilities provided for them to the fullest.<BR><BR>Principal Millard is glad to see how the community has gotten involved in addressing the water problem in the school. “This would not have been possible had Unicef not provided the toilets. I don’t think the parents would have agreed to shelling out the money that quickly. They were inspired by what Unicef has done for the school,” he said with a smile on his face.  (Rachelle M.

What topic would we invariably talk about whenever we’d get together? What has caused, and is continuing to cause us women endless frustration and dissatisfaction the world over?  What have we been battling, and kept losing to over and over again?<br><br>A woman reading this would have guessed already.  Yes, it’s our figure, or more specifically, our loss of figure. <br> <br>Yeah, I know – sad, isn’t it?  We continually lament over our bulges ... you know, that thingy that we’d see right away when we look down? Yes, that thingy – also the culprit behind those rolling undies. They really do stand out, do they?  No amount of inhaling on our part could keep those tummies in.  <br><br>The bulges are not that bad though.  They can be a source of great amusement, but only if you have an irreverent kid like mine.  My brat loves to jiggle it, and watch it move about like jelly.  That never fails to bring out peals of laughter ... joyful laughter from her.  Mine was more of the agonized kind. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(sigh!)</span><br><br>And did you know that we also have the much sought-after, macho male must-have six- pack?  Ahh! And you thought that it’s only Taylor Lautner <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(Jacob of the Twilight</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">saga</span>) and his kind who have those! How wrong could you be? <br> <br>Heavily-endowed ladies like yours truly have those, too, and more!  But ours got misplaced. Somewhere along the way to our abs, our six-pack changed course, and found its way into our backs.  If you are one of those who now looks at your image in the mirror with increasing dismay, do this at home: put on a tight brassiere and a close-fitting shirt – then look at your back.  You won’t miss them.<br><br>But whether it’s the bulge or the six-pack, our battle boils down to one thing: weight gain.  This is a curse that most of us are born with.  We only get to enjoy our slimmer selves for a short while.  After the babies start coming, off to heavyville most of us go.<br><br>Weight gain almost always comes with motherhood and age.  It is as inevitable as the onset of wrinkles and the white hairs.  But there are those of us who hasten this process because of our passion for all the sinful food out there!<br><br>Oh! If only there is fairness in this world, the vegetables and the fish would be the definite no-nos!  Then we’d get to tell our children ... “No, you cannot eat vegetables ... they are <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">baaaad</span> for your health!”  Wouldn’t that be great?  Then children would joyfully eat “healthy” food.<br><br>I have been working out in the gym these past five weeks because I finally admitted that dieting alone wouldn’t get me where I want to be.  I recently ballooned to almost 180 lbs. after I’ve had another pregnancy.  <br><br>In an effort to keep our baby from being lost, I had to take prednisone among other medications.  The steroids, plus my mandatory bedrest, and all the yummylicious food I could demand from my very attentive and compliant husband all contributed into making me the female version of the sumo wrestler.<br><br>My yo-yo dieting actually helped me lose around 10 lbs at a time, but I gained back about half of them in a matter of weeks because I didn’t do any exercise.  So raised the white flag I did.  I dragged myself into the gym, and with a heavy heart, I joined in.<br><br>And so, as I agonized over the aches and the pains that come along with the gym scene, and as I counted off the repetitions for the weights that got heavier by the second, my mind would wonder off somewhere, and dream about a parallel universe where chewing is the only exercise that we needed to do.  <br><br>And if we wanted to go the extra mile, we could actually add to our exercise routine using only our thumbs as we press the buttons in the remote control. Yes, my like-minded sisters, in my parallel world, the best exercise there is, is lying on the bed comfortably propped up by pillows as we face the TV while munching on fat-burning lechon skin.<br><br>Yes, if only the world were fair.  But back to reality I must return.  My fantasies made me lose count….How many leg raises have I done already, by the way?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews. With Pilate’s permission, he came and took the body away. 39 He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had visited Jesus at night… </span><br><br>Very little is known in the Bible about Joseph from Arimathea, a small city located in Judea, Jerusalem. Just like Nicodemus, another prominent man named in the Gospel of John, Joseph of Arimathea was also a member of the Sanhedrin. This was the highest Jewish tribunal, equivalent to a Jewish supreme court during the time of Christ. <br><br>What we know from Matthew is that Joseph of Arimathea was an affluent man. This explains why he owned a beautiful garden tomb where Jesus was buried after he died from crucifixion. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(MT 27:57).</span> <br><br>What we know from Mark is that he was waiting for the kingdom of God.  This shows us his religious zeal and his spiritual steadfastness. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(Mark 15: 43)</span>. <br><br>What we know from Luke is that he was an upright man. He enjoyed a favorable, wholesome and positive reputation in the community. This is also the very reason why he did not agree with the Sanhedrin’s decision to convict Jesus, an innocent man of crimes he did not commit. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(LK 23:50)</span>. <br><br>What John mentions is that he was a secret follower of the Lord. This shows that despite the positive aspects of his character, Joseph of Arimathea feared public opinion.  He could not openly stand by his own, personal convictions about Christ. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(John 19:38.)</span> <br><br>You see, Joseph of Arimathea was part of a complex and powerful religious circle that openly criticized and rejected the teachings of Christ. For many of them, Jesus was a heretic. For some of them, Jesus was even demon-possessed. <br><br>In short, Joseph of Arimathea knew that becoming identified with Jesus Christ was too precarious and too risky.  It would complicate his otherwise peaceful, comfortable and quiet existence.  And so for all practical reasons and intentions, and because of great fear of the religious majority, Joseph of Arimathea took the safest and most harmless road of all — he followed Jesus in secret. <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Fear </span><br></div><br><br>        <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">JN 19:38 … Now Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly because he feared the Jews.</span>  Fear is the feeling of dread, terror and panic.  Fear is one the greatest reasons why many often choose the path of least resistance. <br><br>This is also known as the Principle of Least Effort.  This phraseology is used in library science and research. This principle states that regardless of one’s skill and proficiency as a searcher, or regardless of their level of subject expertise, a person seeking information will always use research tools that are most familiar, most convenient, and most easy to use. <br><br>But you see, just like the experience of Joseph of Arimathea, change is inevitable.  There will come a time when we will realize that the path of least effort is no longer the wisest, the most meaningful, and the most relevant path to take.  And so after being a secret follower of Jesus, Joseph of Arimathea, stirred and convicted by the courage and righteousness of Jesus, rose up one day, risked all he had, and openly aligned himself with Christ. <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Faith </span><br></div><br><br>        <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">v. 18 With Pilate’s permission, he came and took the body away.</span> Faith, in the context of Joseph of Arimathea’s experience, means rising up in courage to make a stand for Christ. It means taking a posture of courage and righteous action. <br><br>During the time of Christ, the remains of an executed criminal were often left unburied or at least, put in a pauper’s field.  In some cases, a near relative such as a mother would ask permission for the body. <br><br>While the rest  of the disciples and close associates of Jesus were hiding in fear for their lives, Joseph of Arimathea, finally stood in faith. He came forward to do what was right — to give Jesus a decent and honorable burial. Using very wisely his power and religious influence, he demonstrated an unexpected gesture of faith and courage. He asked Pontius Pilate for the body of Jesus, and together with another secret disciple Nicodemus, they performed the required ritual of preparation before laying to rest the early remains of the Lord. <br><br>It was just a few hours before sundown, the start of the Jewish Shabat (sabbath). Everthing had to be done quietly, swiftly, and honorably.  In another gesture of faith, Joseph of Arimathea goes the second mile.  After wrapping the body of Jesus in traditional spies with the burial cloth, he offered a never-been used tomb in his garden to be the resting place of Jesus’ remains, fulfilling an old testament prophecy that the anointed one of God will indeed be buried among the rich. <br><br>Brothers and sisters, we learn from Joseph of Arimathea’s unique with Christ that God, in his grace and goodness, will provide every opportunity for his people to come forward and  cross over from fear to faith. It is only necessary that when these prophetic moments come, we do not shrink back but  rise to the occasion — we do not hide but step out in faith, knowing that a secret disciple is no disciple at all! <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Because last year, in the Cinemalaya, I was part of its Film Congress as a representative of the filmmaking scene in Dumaguete—and it was the usual part work, part pleasure. This year, it was all pure pleasure. <br><br>Get this: I was drinking San Miguel Lite with the screenwriter Armando Lao. Earlier that weekend, I had planed in from Dumaguete just for the Cinemalaya and to process my U.S. visa for my fellowship in the International Writers Program in Iowa. It was the start of a good weekend, and the film festival—the most acclaimed of its kind this part of the Philippines—had just began. <br><br>People I know from film were suddenly everywhere. I’ve always loved this kind of Manila trips that I take; they are always occasions for instant reunions. People you only see in Facebook are suddenly there in front of you, in the flesh. And the hugs and the handshakes are constant, they fly everywhere. <br><br>That Saturday, I had gone to the launch of three books being put out by newbie publisher Gilbert Sape of Grey Matter Publishing—two of them by good friends of mine, people I “hang” out with in the blogging world. There’s<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Dear Migs: Letters to the Manila Gay Guy</span> by “Migs” and edited by <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Philippine Daily Inquirer</span> theater critic Gibbs Cadiz, and then there’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Wet Book: Stories From the Bathhouse</span> by Joel Macaventa, alias McVie, and edited by the film producer and writer Raymond Red. The launch was in Quezon City—and the place, which was the studio of the photographer Ian Felix Alquiros, was packed. I met old friends and new—the writers J. Neil Garcia, Moki Villegas, and Ronald Baytan, the visual artist Daniel Palma Tayoma,  the director Jade Castro of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Endo</span> fame, the TV broadcasters RG Cruz and Ryan Edward Chua, among many others. Hugs, handshakes. I see Carlo Vergara, the writer of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ZsaZsa Zaturnnah</span>—and we exclaim: “Finally!” Another round of hugs. <br><br>Then it was back to Manila, to the lovely Syquia Building near Malate, where I dined on varieties of cheese and wine and cold cuts in the beautiful apartment of the director Butch Perez. He had a great view of the Manila Bay, and he entertained us—the writers Ginny Mata, Kit Kwe, Marc Escalona Gaba, and Kris Lacaba—to the disco beat of David Byrne and Fatboy Slim’s Imelda musical <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Here Lies Love</span>. We talked about Iowa winters and Negrense Chinese matriarchs with recipes, and the lives and loves of people we know. The usual stuff. <br><br>On Sunday, there was the late night beer with Bing Lao. “You are a god,” I had told Bing earlier—a compliment he must get a lot. This is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">the</span> screenplay writer, after all, of all those acclaimed movies, from Jeffrey Jeturian’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pila Balde</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sana Pag-ibig Na</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kubrador</span> to Brillante Mendoza’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Serbis</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kinatay</span>, those controversial Cannes Film Festival winners that has brought to the world a concept of film writing that is gaining traction the way the Danish had with its Dogme 95. In Bing’s case, it is the Found Story concept that is central to the style of such emerging filmmakers as Francis X. Pasion, Jay Altarejos, Jeturian, and Mendoza, among others. <br><br>He had been going around the CCP complex among the throng that constituted the devotees of the Cinemalaya Film Festival, filming Mark Xander Fabillar (who has a supporting turn in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Halo-Halo</span>) and Jay Altarejos as they went about their way welcoming people to the gala premiere of Jay’s latest film, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pink Halo-Halo</span>. It was going to be a kind of pseudo-documentary, and I was in the middle of the shoot. Later, after the premiere, the beer came, and the talk and banter. <br><br>People came and went. Joel Torre passed by. Raymond Red stopped by, and I told him, “When are you going to finish <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Patayin sa Shokot si Remington?</span> I can’t wait to see it <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">na</span>.” He laughed and did a short curtsy. That was it. The director Raya Martin also passed by, sporting a new look of cropped hair. “When did you come back?” I asked him, “I thought you were holed up somewhere in Paris or wherever.” We hugged, and he said, “I’m just here, just lying low.” I laughed. <br><br>The female lead of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Halo-Halo</span>, the wonderful Angeli Bayani, soon joined us— and it was the start of the marathon to a long, beautiful night where everybody pitched in to share “talk” and industry tidbits, all told in gestures and enunciations of grand drama. You know, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">theater and film people</span>. <br><br>I called her the new Meryl Streep. And Angeli blushed. She was transcendent in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pink Halo-Halo</span>, a film of such beautiful simplicity that I turned to Jay, who was sitting beside me in the Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo, and said, “I hate you. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pinaiyak mo ako</span>.” And I thought of that, and was bemused by how far Jay had come—from the titillations of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ang Lalake sa Parola</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ang Lihim ni Antonio</span> to the grit and passion of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ang Laro sa Buhay ni Juan</span> to the heart of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pink Halo-Halo</span>. Because sometimes it’s hard when you find yourself put in a box by other people—and not allowed to be anything more. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Hindi ka na</span> bold gay films!” the magnificent Ed de los Santos Cabagnot had told him earlier, and broke into boisterous laughter. <br><br>We all laughed, too. <br><br>And that was it that weekend. Those nights. With Manila friends. And then, two days later, I escaped Typhoon Basyang by minutes, and planed all the way back to my Negros town, where everything is quieter. Quiet, yes—but it has also become a reservoir of so much missing other people not here. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Emmel, professor of Zoology and director of the famous <a href=\"http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/mcguire/\">McGuire Center for Lepidoptera & Biodiversity</a> at the Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, USA. <br><br>Professor Emmel, who was my schoolmate at Stanford University in California in the 1960s, gave a highly informative power-point lecture on the research and educational program of his Center. The lecture, held at the Silliman Multi-Purpose Center,  was attended by about 80 people composed of students, teachers, and representatives of conservation organizations in Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental provinces. <br><br>The higher education institutions that responded to our invitation to attend the lecture were Silliman University, Negros Oriental State University, St. Paul University, Foundation University, and Negros State College of Agriculture. <br><br>Butterflies are a charismatic group of terrestrial organisms. Everybody loves them because they evoke the human aesthetic sense, and enhance the feeling and appreciation of the goodness of nature. <br><br>From the scientific point of view, butterflies attract both young and old because of their interesting life history and ecology that are full of wonderful events.<br> <br>Butterflies have contributed to a better understanding of ourselves. A good example that Professor Emmel mentioned in his lecture is the genetic explanation why humans have four main blood types, which cannot be accounted for by the Mendelian laws. <br><br>The explanation,  based on studies on butterflies, is the presence of multiple alleles (several forms of genes at one gene locus). <br><br>The Emmel lecture dealt with the international program of the McGuire Center which consists of research, education, and promotion of conservation of biodiversity. <br><br>The research deals with the sciences of systematics, ecology and evolution; these studies can be done by students using museum collections. The education program of the Center is a unique one as it encourages children and students to watch scientists at work so they become familiar with scientific methods. The museum exhibits and the butterfly gardens  provide hands-on experience for the public, especially children who are curious about butterfly life  history. <br><br>To promote its conservation program, Dr. Emmel and his team travel to many parts of the world building networks of collaboration with research organizations, government agencies, and academic institutions. <br><br>His first trip to the Philippines has resulted in a memoranda of agreement with the Department of Environment & Natural Resources, and universities such as the University of San Carlos on student support for graduate studies, setting up protected areas, etc. <br><br>From the lecture, it became clear that opportunities exist for people to build butterfly gardens and farms for scientific studies and for conservation of nature. <br><br>Thus far, few universities have engaged in setting up reserves for butterflies. In Dumaguete, St. Paul University is one of them. <br><br>Butterflies can also be farmed to provide supplementary incomes. But most importantly, butterfly reserves can help ensure that this group of animals will survive the changes now occurring on earth. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br><a href=\"mailto:docmequi@yahoo.com \">docmequi@yahoo.com </a><br><br>Remember the old adage: “Feed a cold and starve a fever”, or is it “Feed a fever and starve a cold?” With the advent of the rainy season and a greater chance of catching cold, I thought that writing about recent insights on how one can avoid catching the cold virus. or treating it when you have it, would be appropriate and timely. In fact, at this writing, I am recovering from a cold while friends, colleagues, and loved ones are suffering from the discomfort of colds. <br><br>We are all susceptible to colds and fortunately, present day research suggests that by utilizing “speed and science”, we could beat the malady at its onset. Some recommended strategies to adopt at a cold’s initial symptoms, like the first “tickle” in the throat, after the “suspicious double sneeze,” or right after the “vague feeling of blah creeping in” are the following: <br><br>1. Eat big and early. Upon waking up and feeling sick and tired, research suggests that a good morning meal could help fight off the cold, lending validity to the advice “feed a cold”. Researchers from the Netherlands recently analyzed the effects of a 1,200-calorie breakfast on the immune system versus eating nothing at all. They found that “eating big and eating early increased blood levels of gamma interferon, a natural antiviral agent, by 450 percent and going hungry actually caused a 17 percent decrease”. This makes sense because during cold rainy days, our bodies need extra energy to produce more heat to keep us warm, healthy, and alert. <br><br>2. Stress out your symptoms. When Ohio State University researchers had 34 male subjects take either a 12- minute memory test or watch a 12-minute surgical procedure video, they found that the test takers’ levels of SigA, a key immune-system protein, increased dramatically. The moral of the study is to charge your immune system by exposing yourself to short-term stress, the kind that you have some control of. <br><br>“Stress response is a normal protective coping mechanism,” the researcher concluded. “The body prepares itself for potential harm, and activates its immune resources. It shouldn’t take longer than a day or half a day,” he says. “If the stress response is continuous, then the immune system will be suppressed.” <br><br>A good form of a mild stressful activity is exercise. When you feel the symptoms of a cold setting in, you will feel your body getting weak and your mind clouded. These symptoms can be prevented from developing to a full-fledge fever by sweating it out. And a good way is through exercise — not under the heat of the sun -- but in the early morning or late afternoon, such as brisk walking or jogging, or, dance aerobics, just to sweat out the symptoms of a cold or flu. <br><br>Also, in a recent study of 547 subjects, researchers at the University of Massachusetts found that the most physically- active people had 25 percent fewer upper-respiratory infections over the course of a year than did the couch potatoes. <br><br>It is believed that exercise strengthens the immune system by increasing the body’s production of white blood cells. “If you exercise, you should see two benefits: One, you’ll have a reduced risk of catching a cold, and two, if you’re unlucky enough to get a cold, you should have it for a shorter period of time,” says Charles E. Matthews, lead study author. <br><br>3. Sleep. UCLA psychiatrist and sleep researcher, Dr. Michael Irwin, claims that if the amount of sleep a person logs decreases by 40 percent or more (for instance, you sleep four hours instead of the usual seven), the effectiveness of the immune system will decline by 50 percent. For the immune system to operate at full strength, a straight eight-hour sleep is needed to produce the highest level of “natural killer cells” which attack viruses. <br><br>“Wear light clothing—shorts and a T-shirt—during your waking hours at home; Japanese researchers found that this adjusts a person’s core body temperature enough to improve sleep quality and boost the immune response.” <br><br>4. Clean hands, close nose. There are two ways we commonly catch a cold: by unconsciously putting our hands in our noses or mouths or by sucking in the germs from someone else’s sneeze or cough. According to medical researchers, the easiest way to contract the common cold is by having dirty hands. To keep yourself safe, wash and clean your hands regularly, and always bring a hand sanitizer. While hand washing takes care of the first avenue of infection, what about the airborne source? <br><br>“Do the obvious—hold your breath for as long as you can after someone sneezes or coughs near you,” recommends Murray Grossan, an ear-nose- throat specialist at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, and author of The Sinus Cure. “Think of germ- laden air as colored smoke,” says Dr. Grossan. “If you hold your nose, the colored smoke won’t go in.” <br><br>5. Take a shower when you are drenched by rain.  At first glance, this suggestion seems unusual. But if you think about it clearly, taking a shower right after getting wet in the rain actually makes sense. Diseases develop when your body experiences a drastic change in temperature. Taking a shower stabilizes the cold temperature caused by rain, then it produces a gradual shift back to your normal body temperature once you dry yourself. Towel yourself dry vigorously after your shower. <br><br>6. Drink green tea. When Canadian researchers added green tea to laboratory samples of the adenovirus (one of the bugs responsible for colds), they found that it stopped the virus from multiplying. This is because of a chemical compound called EGCG, found in certain kinds of tea, but in the highest concentration in green tea. At the onset of a cold, start drinking green tea to stop the production of adenovirus. “It’s the difference between staying home for two or three days, and going to work and just sniffling a bit,” says Joseph M. Weber, lead study author and a professor of microbiology at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec. <br><br>In my case, when I noted the symptoms of a potential full-blown cold (nasal drip, frequent sneezing, ticklish throat), I took Tylenol cold capsules for two days, with 30- minutes of light walking in the afternoon. And I made sure I had three full meals daily, and had a snack when I felt hungry. Feeding a cold, indeed, has a scientific basis. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The image usually represents St. Mary and the infant Jesus – But even as a secular image without any religious overtones, a “Mother and Child” picture has deep resonance for most people. <br><br>It seems to say “Look- this is who we are, all of us, this is how we came to be”.  It’s probably the most common image that exists, too universal even to be a cliché. But this picture is a little different. <br><br>For one thing, the woman is very young, an early teen-ager, little more than a child herself. And she’s not looking at the child with love; she’s holding him like a grocery bag. She stands there motionless, staring into empty space, her eyes blank, her mouth open. <br><br>And, unlike the child in a common image, this child is not asleep, or even resting peacefully; he seems to be twisting awkwardly in the woman’s grasp.  It’s hardly an image of motherly concern. And then there’s the setting. <br><br>“Mother and Child” images are normally set indoors, in well protected environments with a feeling of security, even if it’s only a manger in a cave. And often there are supporting figures pictured: some angels, or at least a husband. But here, the woman and child are alone in the open, with nothing behind them but ruined concrete pillars, torn fishnets, and the empty sea. <br><br>There’s no feeling here of warmth and concern over a protected child. This image is actually the reverse of a standard “Mother and Child” image. It’s a picture of empty-hearted isolation and unconcern for the child’s welfare. One fears for such a child’s future. <br><br>It’s a disturbing picture and a real situation, even a common one. I took this picture some years ago, but I’m sure a similar picture could be taken somewhere in Dumaguete today, if anyone cared to do so. Not all children are loved and wanted. <br><br>That afternoon I saw this girl standing near my house with the baby, strongly framed by the broken pillars and the sea. I had a camera, so I took the picture. I  thought it would make a nice seaside scene, so I had it enlarged. I only realized then, when I looked at it, what a strange picture it really was. <br><img src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport7-25-10.jpg\" align=\"LEFT\"\" border=\"0\"><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>",

Since it adopted the concept of a marine sanctuary in 1982, it was managed by a Marine Management Council, a separate organization from the barangay government. <br><br>The MMC, which had strong ties with the municipal government, had been successful in enforcing the marine reserve guidelines when the island was declared a protected landscape and seascape in 1994, and included in the National Integrated Protected Areas System of the Department of Environment & Natural Resources. <br><br>With this,  the MMC gave way to the Protected Area Management Board (PAMB) – a different group with a different master.  <br><br>From a community-managed group, the PAMB put the island under a broader 15-man group chaired by the DENR Regional Executive Director and represented by the Provincial Environment & Natural Resources Officer, the Provincial Planning & Development Officer, the Mayor of Dauin, a representative of Silliman University, the barangay captain of Apo Island, and a few other representatives of NGOs and people’s organizations.  There is also a Park Superintendent, a DENR employee, who is the chief operating officer of the protected area. <br><br>Because Apo Island is also a barangay, there are two heads in Apo with overlapping responsibilities.  Also, the authority of the Municipal Mayor appears to be inexistent here, as he only sits as a member of the PAMB – not as the CEO of Dauin. <br><br>But perhaps the biggest issue the Dauinanons have over the PAMB is that all the money collected from the island, which runs into the millions per year, is siphoned to Manila, and only 75 percent of it comes back to the Island—not to the local government unit—in the form of projects. <br><br>It would now appear that placing the island under the PAMB is a step backward in terms of devolution and local autonomy, especially that the island was managed well by the MMC back then. <br><br>The island should be given back to the local government unit, if only to live up to its billing as the world’s first community-managed marine resource. <br><br>Sure, there may be safeguards to ensure that the environment would continue to be protected, but the bottomline is that the island should function as an integral part of Dauin, under the principle of local autonomy. <br><br>Apo Island should be run as a community— not as a corporation. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

It was followed by a reception and question-and-answer session. <br><br>As a former classmate of Dr. Alcala while both attended Stanford University in the United States, Dr. Emmel was not only eager to reunite with his former graduate school colleague during this visit to Dumaguete, but he was also enthusiastic to begin working on a collaborative effort connecting his home institution, the Florida Museum of Natural History, and the Silliman University Angelo King Center for Research & Environmental Management to promote conservation and biodiversity research and conservation. <br><br>Dr. Emmel was accompanied by two colleagues from the McGuire Center and Florida Museum: J. Court Whelan and Galileo Encabo; the U.S. group spent the next several days conducting preliminary research in Dumaguete City and the surrounding areas until Friday when they returned to Cebu and departed to cross the Pacific Ocean en route back to the US after a wonderful stay in the Philippines. <br> <br><br><br> <br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

She never woke up from that sleep. The diagnosis was dengue hemorrhagic fever  (DHF).{{more}} <br><br>What a tragedy!  She had just passed the Nurse Licensure Exam which was released that year, and they were all informed to come back for the oathtaking and pinning ceremony  two weeks before she died. <br><br>Unlike her other classmates, Nimfa was immediately hired as a staff nurse in a hospital in their hometown after she took the NLE.  The medical history revealed that she had been having on-and -off fever for more than a  week, and not wanting to incur absences from her work, she kept on reporting even if she had fever until that day when she felt she could not go on anymore.<br><br>Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a severe, potentially deadly infection spread by certain species of mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus) . The mosquito vectors breed in small collections of  water such as storage tanks, cisterns, flower vases, and backyard litter.<br><br>Four different dengue viruses are known to cause dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue hemorrhagic fever occurs when a person catches a different type dengue virus after being infected by another one sometime before. Prior immunity to a different dengue virus type plays an important role in this severe disease.<br><br>The Department of Health claims that  factors which favor the spread of the disease are: poor environmental sanitation, water stored within the house or standing water in the premises, high population density or overcrowding.  The disease affects all ages but almost all  cases are among children 0–15 years old.  Both sexes are equally affected.  Cases are more frequent during the rainy season, and the incidence is higher in urban communities. <br><br>Dengue became a notifiable disease in 1958. Since then, cases have been reported to occur sporadically in urban centers, and steadily increased to a point when it is now an endemic disease in all provinces and cities in the country. In recent years, more epidemics have been reported in urban centers. However, rural areas are not spared.<br><br>The World Health Organization reports that : “Worldwide, more than 100 million cases of dengue fever occur every year. A small number of these develop into dengue hemorrhagic fever. Most infections in the United States are brought in from other countries. It is possible for a traveler who has returned to the United States to pass the infection to someone who has not traveled.”<br><br>Risk factors for dengue hemorrhagic fever include having antibodies to dengue virus from prior infection and being younger than 12, female, or Caucasian.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Symptoms</span><br></div><br><br>        <br>Early symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever are similar to those of dengue fever, but after several days the patient becomes irritable, restless, and sweaty. These symptoms are followed by a shock -like state.<br><br>Bleeding may appear as tiny spots of blood on the skin (petechiae) and larger patches of blood under the skin (ecchymoses). Minor injuries may cause bleeding.<br><br>Shock may cause death. If the patient survives, recovery begins after a one-day crisis period.<br><br>Early symptoms include:  Decreased appetite, fever, headache, joint pains, malaise, muscle aches, vomiting.<br><br>Acute  phase symptoms include:  restlessness followed by: ecchymosis, general rash, petechiae, and worsening of earlier symptoms.  Shock-like state may follow manifested by cold, clammy extremities and sweatiness (diaphoretic).<br><br>Exams and Tests:  A physical examination may reveal: enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), low blood pressure, rash, red eyes, red throat, swollen glands and weak rapid pulse.<br><br>Tests may include: arterial blood gases, coagulation studies, electrolytes , hematocrit, liver enzymes, platelet count, serologic studies (demonstrate antibodies to Dengue viruses),serum studies from samples taken during acute illness and convalescence (increase in titer to Dengue antigen), tourniquet test (causes petechiae to form below the tourniquet),  X-ray of the chest (may demonstrate pleural effusion).<br><br>Treatment:  Because Dengue hemorrhagic fever is caused by a virus for which there is no known cure or vaccine, the only treatment is to treat the symptoms.<br><br>    * A transfusion of fresh blood or platelets can correct bleeding problems<br>    * Intravenous (IV) fluids and electrolytes are also used to correct electrolyte imbalances<br>    * Oxygen therapy may be needed to treat abnormally low blood oxygen<br>    * Rehydration with intravenous (IV) fluids is often necessary to treat dehydration<br>    * Supportive care in an intensive care unit/environment<br><br>Outlook (Prognosis):   With early and aggressive care, most patients recover from dengue hemorrhagic fever. However, half of untreated patients who go into shock do not survive.<br><br>Possible Complications: encephalopathy, liver damage, residual brain damage, seizures and shock.<br><br>In most instances, the client survives just like a nurse who came home to visit her parents, one summer, a few years ago.  She had fever for several days. One of the blood exams  revealed leukopenia  or  a platelet count below normal (normal platelet count is: 150,000 – 450,000 per cu mm) which was suggestive of DHF.  Since there was no available private room in the hospital, she opted to stay home but  she was given intravenous fluids and was closely monitored by a niece who is a physician.  A few days later she was transferred to the hospital where she was given more attention and additional medicines.  She recovered and was able to return to the U.S.A. <br><br>The rainy season is here and the threat of  DHF is back (two of our friends got sick with it last May and recovered).  So  let’s clean our premises, change the water in flower vases inside the house daily, check the backyard and other areas for possible breeding places of mosquitoes, and don’t take fever for granted…for you may have been bitten by the  daybiting,  Aedes Aegypti  mosquito and may get sick with the deadly DHF.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">By: Nenita P.

Their quiet lives had been disrupted. Their children were displaced.  They found themselves living so uncomfortably in a God- forsaken place where there was not much food and water. And worse, they were stuck with a leader who did not seem to know where to go and what to do. <br><br>This is wilderness life.  It is a life of scarcity, frustration, and great disappointment. It is also a life of confusion, betrayal, and pain. <br><br>Interestingly, the God of Israel, in all his glory and wisdom, saw it necessary that the Israelites pass through the wilderness of Sinai instead of transporting them directly to the Promise Land. <br><br>Obviously, there was more in God’s mind than milk and honey for his precious people. He had in mind the shaping of their character, the strengthening of their faith, and the transformation of their hearts towards the Lord and towards one another. <br><br>And so, not knowing what to do and where to proceed, Moses, their leader, decided to go up to a nearby mountain to have a much-needed meeting with God. <br><br>In the Old Testament times until today, mountains are believed to be sacred places where God’s  presence richly dwells.  As Moses was still making his way up, God spoke and gave two powerful reminders to his people. <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Purpose</span><br></div><br><br>        Philosophy professor <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1556520387?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwsuaconacom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1556520387\">Dr. Huge Moorhead</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wwwsuaconacom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1556520387\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />once wrote to 250 of the best-known philosophers, scientists, writers, and intellectuals in the world asking them, “What is the meaning of life?” He published their responses in a book. Some offered their best guesses, while some admittedly said they did not really know. <br><br>It is often in the wilderness of our lives that we get a closer and more serious look at our goals and motivations in life. It is in the wilderness that we realize how pointless life really is without the Lord.  It is in the wilderness that we discover that our greatest wealth, our most powerful allies, and even our best efforts and intentions do not mean anything if our lives are not aligned with the Lord. <br><br>What about us?  Are we in the wilderness, too?  Is it a health problem?  Is it difficult financial situation?  Is your family going through a trial? Are you becoming weary because of the cruelty and judgment of those around you? <br><br>Let us take heart. Let us allow God to take our eyes farther than what we see.  Let God use this time to remind us of where our true security comes from. <br><br>And so when God led Moses to mountain, Moses was reminded of God’s purpose for his people. God wanted to raise a people who would bear his Name.  God wanted to set apart a people—a chosen nation— through whom he can display to the world his glory, his wisdom and his purposes. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“If you will listen obediently to what I say and keep my covenant, out of all peoples you’ll be my special treasure.” </span><br><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Perseverance</span><br></div><br><br>        Perseverance is all about staying power.  As you know, the wilderness life also brought out the worse of the Israelites — their faithlessness, their complaining spirit, their lack of reverence and respect to God and to God’s chosen leader. <br><br>In the mountain, God sought for the people’s complete trust and full cooperation. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“If you listen…. If you obey…. If you keep my covenant….you’ll be my special treasure.” </span><br><br>In the mountain, God made the people realize that things cannot be handed to them on a silver platter.  God led them to realize that all the milk and all the honey will be useless if their hearts were not truly turned to the Lord, and their allegiance was still to the idols that they had built in their hearts. <br><br>Only the children and the children’s children of those who originally went out of Egypt entered the Promise Land led by Joshua and Caleb. It is a bittersweet reminder to us that despite the patience and graciousness of God, many hearts remained uncooperative and hardened -- unwilling to trust God all the way. <br><br>But there were those who made it to the Promise Land. They took to heart their purpose, and they certainly persevered all the way. <br><br>How about us?  When we find ourselves in the wilderness, will we give up, or will climb the mountain of the Lord?  Will we insist on our own plans, or will we fully yield to God’s agenda? Will we be intimidated by the heat and pressures of the wilderness, or will we stick it out in full confidence that if we listen, if we obey, and take to heart our covenant with the Lord, he will lead us out of the wilderness and usher us into our glorious future?<br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Her tinkling voice brought me back. <br><br>It was what greeted me when she opened the door to her hotel room, in that glorified hospital that marks the southern tip that is the Boulevard. “Is this you? But you’re not a little boy anymore!” she said. I think I must have replied, with a smile: “Sorry, but I couldn’t stop growing up. No one could.” <br><br>My mother had brought me here, to this hotel, after endless text messages that day, asking me that my Tita Batch was asking for me. “Do you remember her?” she asked. <br><br>“Of course, I remember her,” I said. “I still remember Siquijor.” My mind was suddenly running—there were quick slivers of thoughts that contained golden sunsets, a motorcycle ride around the island, an encounter with a strange nocturnal insect that gave me rashes for my remaining days in that island. <br><br>But Bathsheba had apparently forgotten all of that, I quickly realized. “I brought you to Siquijor?” was what she said, disbelieving, her voice still tinkling in that familiar way. “I don’t remember that.” <br><br>It didn’t matter. I have long since accepted the fact that all of us accommodate our memories to a set of definite totems that we hope can sustain us in this mad scramble that is life. It’s what grownups do. <br><br>“What I remember most is a letter you sent me once,” she later said, “when you were still in grade six.” <br><br>“I sent you a letter?” This one I didn’t remember. <br><br>“Yes, when I was still working as a nurse in New York,” she said. “I still have that letter. It’s pasted in one of my albums. It was a really well-written letter, for somebody your age—and I still show it to friends, and I tell them, ‘This boy here? He’s a writer now.’” <br><br>“What did I say?” <br><br>“You told me that one day you would love to visit Disney World. It was your dream.” <br><br>“I did? It was?” <br><br>I vaguely remembered having a Disney phase in childhood. I had watched all the films—both live action and animation, had drawn all the zany characters in hundreds of sketchpads, had collected all the brochures about the Happiest Place on Earth. I could still scrawl out, until today, Disney’s famous signature in one go, and without batting an eyelash; Mickey Mouse’s face is just a sketch away from any pencil. <br><br>So I told myself, she is telling the truth. <br><br>“And did you know that I live in Orlando now? In Florida,” she said. “So you can visit me any time, and fulfill that dream.” She laughed. I smiled, unbelievably non-committal. <br><br>But the years have taught me detachment, even from silly childhood dreams. <br><br>Soon, she was talking with mother about me—how I was like as a kid, for example. It was then that I caught a glimpse of myself, my past at the very least, as others saw me. <br><br>I was that needful kid? They called it something else. “Parayigon man na siya sa una,” mother said. Parayigon. The needful charm of little children. I shook my head a little, just enough that they wouldn’t see me. <br><br>I don’t remember much how the rest of that evening went. Only that it ended. That she had gone down with us in the elevator to our waiting car. That we had said our goodbyes, and she had said, “I hope to see you when you get to the U.S.,” and that I had nodded. <br><br>I remembered having this persistent thought though: that the past is an uncomfortable place of such aching familiarity—and there is a reason why it feels like a different country, why it’s perfectly behind us. <br><br>The car moved. It was already late at night. I looked at the silent witness of stars, and felt the tug of the present and the future suddenly colliding. I’m here, I told myself. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Paying courtesy calls to the new Mayor has been the order of the day. <BR><BR>Renewing acquaintances, getting-to-know-you-better on temperaments and personalities, and of course, serious discussions on projects and programs of their respective government offices in the City of Dumaguete. <BR><BR>It has been the concern of the Mayor that the “fastest and most efficient delivery of services” to the constituents of this City be given top priority. <BR><BR>A mini gym for barangays Tinago and Motong is now in place, and soon will be open for use by the barangays. <BR><BR>Strategies in curbing criminalities of any sort, attributed to the proliferation of illegal drugs and abuse has been set forth. <BR><BR>One such strategy is the strengthening of the City Anti-Drug Abuse Council, down to every Barangay CADAC. <BR><BR>Clearing out the City of any form of crimes gives way to peace and order, and would entice investors both local and foreign to come to Dumaguete to do business, and provide employment and better opportunities to Dumagueteños. <BR><BR>Moulders of our youth, the four universities and eight schools and colleges (of course, including the secondary and elementary institutions n almost all barangays in our City) have been very instrumental in preparing our young people for a better life ahead. <BR><BR>The paradigms of “getting rid off mediocrity”, and “striving to accelerate towards excellence” are now gaining momentum, also among the schools and their mentors. Graduates from various fields of specialization can be globally-competitive. <BR><BR>These are just but a few things that we can be proud of here in Dumaguete City. The City government led by Mayor Sagarbarria, along with the various sectors in the community will provide the opportunities; it will be the people’s share to be industrious as well.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

Nidoy and Carmelisa Tolentino </span><br></div><br><br>        <br>It’s hard to sit infront of a band whose members’ popularity ranges from high school and college giddy girls to aspiring teenage rock stars. <br><br>The songs titled Bitiw, Puso, and Crazy for You have become an anthem of the youth’s psyche. Tracing their roots from the Ateneo de Manila University, Spongecola is no longer just a college band. <br><br>MetroPost had a chance to talk with Yael, Gosh, Ted and Armo hours before their performance on July 2 at the Silliman University Acquaintance Party – an event sponsored by Smart Communications. <br><br>Get to know more of them and their plans, upcoming album, and whereabouts in this exclusive interview: <br><br>MetroPost: A lot of fans are curious, how did you guys come up with your band name? <br><br>Yael: It started from a book called Mr. Sponge’s Sporting Tour. Do’n namin nakuha yung “Sponge” and then we used that, and competed sa Battle of the Bands. And then we won but meron na palang gano’ng name ng band sa Detroit so we added another word para lang maiba. So we had “Cola”. We had other options like dog, cat, mat, rat, any random word. It could have been anything. But we ended up with Cola. <br><br> MP: But is it true that  you did theater before? <br><br>Yael: Yup. We were with a theater org before. Gosh and I were classmates in high school before but we were also in a theater group. So I think most of the people in theater are also into music; they’re all connected naman. <br><br>MP: What were your courses back in college? <br><br>Yael: English Literature <br><br>Armo: Interdisciplinary Studies <br><br>Gosh: Information Design <br><br>Ted: Communications Technology Management <br><br>MP: When was the last time you released an album? <br><br>Yael: The last time was in September 2008. So it’s been a long time. <br><br>MP: Do you have any upcoming projects? <br><br>Yael: We’re recording our fourth album in our own studio. <br><br>MP: When will it be released? <br><br>Yael: Hopefully by September if we’re able to finish it cause with these things, it takes a lot of time talaga. <br><br>MP: Who writes your songs? <br><br>Yael: Ako and si Gosh ang nagsusulat madalas; si Armo nagpapaingay, o ‘kaya naman nagpapatahimik; tapos si Ted nagpapasarap. (laughs) <br><br>MP: How many tracks are included in your upcoming album? <br><br>Yael: It depends on how many songs are good, and how many songs are okay.<br> <br>Gosh: We’re still doing the song. <br><br>Yael: Yeah, we’re still writing. <br><br>MP: Are these original songs? <br><br>Gosh: Syempre! Ayaw namin magbayad ng rights. <br><br>MP: How is this different from your previous album? <br><br>Yael: For one, we have our new drummer, Ted. <br><br>Gosh: We’ll show them naman yung talent niya. <br><br>Yael: He has a hip-hop vibe when he plays his drums. <br><br>MP: Do you have any tentative name for your upcoming album? <br><br>Yael: We’ve thrown a lot of random names like Iyakan is the New Clubbing or All I See is Road, but a lot of these things are just jokes. We really don’t have a name for the album yet. I’m pretty sure though, we are joking about it right now but eventually, we will have nothing. And then scamper something silly, and then come up with something good. <br><br>MP: Who are your influences while doing the album? <br><br>Yael: Ako U2, Smashing Pumpkins, Dashboard, Jason Mraz, random YouTube videos, Deftones. <br><br>Armo: Tsaka mga OPM, Tonight we Sleep... <br><br>Ted: Our goal is to get that sound of Sponge Cola during its first album. <br><br>Yael: We want to go back to the simpler times of life when we just write what we feel. It’s when you don’t drink your drinks, and you don’t let your drinks drink you. <br><br>MP: What’s your favorite Sponge Cola song? <br><br>Armo: Ako, ayokong sabihin kasi baka magselos yung ibang songs (Laughs). <br><br>MP: How many times have you been here in Dumaguete? <br><br>Yael: I think around six times. Nakakadalawang birthdays na ako dito. Nagkakataon lang kasi ang birthday ko is Nov. 23. I remember eating crispy pata after playing. <br><br>MP: So how are your fans in Manila different from the ones in the Visayas? <br><br>Yael: No offense to Manila people, I think mas masaya dito. Kasi before, even if we were just starting out, we weren’t as confident pa because we were just a bunch of kids. Tapos parang maski wala naman kaming ginagawa, nakaka-wow talaga; dito parang mas bibong bibo ang crowd. They were singing along with the songs, even those na hindi pa nare-release or anything. Ang sarap kasi ng feeling kapag nasa banda ka, tapos yung mga hindi naririnig na kanta ang hinahanap or kinakanta. It means a lot. <br><br>MP: Any advice for college bands out there who are aspiring to make it big in the music industry? <br><br>Yael and Armo: Stay in school! <br><br>Yael: Magbawas ng hang-outs, tumigil magyosi, huwag uminom masyado, huwag magdrop-out sa school dahil lang sa music. <br><br>Ted: For your groupmates, know who to pick. <br><br>Yael: Kasi sa buhay, hindi ka dapat nagte-take ng shortcuts. Kasi eventually, kahit anong mangyari, kakagatin ka niyang pabalik; pagtranslated, it will bite you in the ass one day. Kakagatin ka sa pwet isang araw.<br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The first is through the academic performance of its students and the second is their migration rate. “We will embrace that student and see to it that that student will graduate,” Calumpang said.<BR><BR>To help students graduate, Calumpang said they are working to increase scholarships through the recruitment of more donors and sponsors, as well as through the scholarships offered by government agencies like the Commission on Higher Education and the Technical Skills Development Authority (Tesda).<BR><BR>“We will also help our students improve their focus,” she said. Calumpang said Acsat maintains a close relationship with the parents and informs them if their students are late or absent every grading period.<BR><BR>Aside from that, we need to motivate our students that there are a number of placements ready for them.

Our people must, therefore, prepare for the worst scenario. <br><br>The key to this preparation is the local government unit. The Climate Change Commission, of course, should provide the national leadership. <br><br>Everybody expected that President Aquino would articulate his program on the environment and climate change when he delivered the State of the Nation Address. But he did not. <br><br>While many environmentalists, including me, were disappointed, we still hope the President would soon make a pronouncement of his policy on environment, especially on the Philippine commitment to the Millennium Development Goals, one of which is environmental sustainability, and I might add, in the face of climate changes. <br><br>Yusuf and Francisco (2009), by modeling, have identified the Philippines, along with Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, West Papua) and Malaysia (Sabah), as among the most vulnerable countries in Southeast Asia, based on the high exposure frequencies of droughts, cyclonic storms, landslides, and floods, all of which are driven by changes in temperature and precipitation. (Note that two countries, Papua New Guinea and Peninsular Malaysia, with fewer people but with plenty of natural resources and a good environment, are not included in the list.) <br><br>The ability of the countries in the list to respond to the challenges of climate change was estimated as a function of such parameters as education, poverty, income inequality, infrastructure, and longevity, (and I add, population). All of these are problems of the Philippines. <br><br>The PAGASA has made some projections of climate change for 2020 and 2050 (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Philippine Strategy for Climate Change and Adaptation</span>, DENR, unpublished). <br><br>The projected rise in mean annual temperature is 0.9 – 1.4º C. March to May will become drier, and the wet season -- July to November -- will become wetter. Reduction in rainfall in most of Mindanao for all seasons is predicted. Stronger southwest monsoon winds, and increasing trend in the number of tropical cyclones (typhoons) in the Visayas, but decreasing trend in Mindanao are projected. <br><br>Areas with increasing elevation in slope gradient are more vulnerable to excessive rains, landslides, flashfloods than gently- sloping areas at lower elevations. <br><br>Most inherently sensitive areas due to topography are in central and northern Luzon, Mindanao, and parts of Mindoro, Negros, and Panay Islands. These sensitive, high mountain areas are coincidentally areas of high endemism for Philippine plants and animals, making us a mega- biodiversity country of the world. <br><br>It is time that both government and our people realize the challenges of climate change and resolve to do can be done about the problems about this change.<br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Gutierrez refused to even meet Pestaño’s parents Felipe and Evelyn. <br><br>“It’s a waste of time to investigate further,” said Ombudsman Aniano Descierto, equally criticized for taking a dive on key cases. <br><br>Not  so, says the  UN Human Rights Commission. “The State party is bound to conduct an investigation, and ensure there is no impunity…. The Human Rights Committee…is of the view that the Philippines fractured the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.” <br><br>Government  should report within 180 days, from receipt of  finding in early April  “what enforceable remedies and solutions were taken”.  <br><br>Suddenly, four  police probers  appeared at the home of  Pestaño’s  parents asking  belated  questions.  <br><br>Felipe and  Evelyn Pestaño  are principal complainants in the impeachment. Former Akbayan Party List Rep. Risa Hontiveros-Baraquel and Gen. Danilo Lim are co-complainants. <br><br>Pestaño had gone to Ateneo and the Philippine Military Academy (Class 1993) with honors. He was 23-years old  when he was found shot in  RPB  Bacolod City.  Within  24 hours, the Navy ruled suicide, sans investigation. <br><br>The NBI and Military Ombudsman waffled.  But Pestaño’s classmates  wrote then Senate President (and former Supreme Court Chief Justice) Marcelo Fernan, documenting how Pestaño blew the whistle on Navy ships being hijacked for smuggling.  <br><br>Senate Report No .800 dismissed the Navy and NBI whitewash. He was bludgeoned, then shot to death while  RPB  Bacolod meandered on a bizzare hour-and-a-half trip in Manila Bay. <br><br>Normally, the  trip from Cavite to the Roxas  Blvd. pier would take 25 minutes. Logbook entries disappeared. <br><br>As cargo master, Pestaño refused to authorize the loading of 14,000 board feet of illegal hardwood logs in Tawi-Tawi. Part of the cargo was a gift of the Governor (Gerry Matba) to the flag- officer-in command (Admiral  Pio Carranza). <br><br> “Orders from above” over-ruled Pestaño. DENR certified that the logs were inspected on Sept. 25 in Zamboanga. But the boat that day  had already docked in Cavite. The logs promptly vanished. Nonetheless,  spurious clearances  appeared. <br><br>Pestaño bucked the peddling of high-powered weapons and bunker fuel, and the loading of shabu. “We’ve received phone calls,” Pestaño’s parents warned him. “They’ll kill you.” The ensign’s reply:  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kawawa ang bayan.</span>  (Pity  the  country.), recalls  Fr James  Reuter, SJ. <br><br>The absence of  blood spatters, bone fragments, or other human tissues is physical evidence more eloquent than a hundred witnesses,” the Senate report  said.  Pestaño was bludgeoned, then shot to death somewhere in the vessel. <br><br>It  is impossible for a person, who sustained a fatal head injury, to walk from some other place, lie on his bed, and drop dead. “The attempt to make it appear that Pestaño killed himself inside his stateroom was elaborate,” the Fernan report says. “No   one person could have accomplisghed it by himself.”<br> <br>Senator, now Manila Mayor Fred Lim declared in a privilege speech. <br><br>Amoroso was not a crew member of BRP Bacolod City.  He became scarce since then. The Navy wasn’t  keen on locating him.  <br><br>“To date, as  like the others, (Amoroso) got  off scot-free,” Lim fumed. Was there an intelligence officer who also boarded in Cavite? <br><br>Ensign Joselito Colico admitted  wiping fingerprints off  the .45 caliber pistol. This tampered with evidence, Lim protested. Colico “was not even charged administratively”. <br><br>Boat commanders  Capt. Ricardo Ordoñez and executive officer Lt. Ruben Roque  left the Navy. <br><br>“P02 Zosimo Villanueva had tipped Pestaño about shabu stashed in more than 20 sacks of rice aboard the ship,” Lim revealed. A week after Pestaño’s murder, Villanueva was “allegedly washed away in a sea mishap”. <br><br>Ensign Alvin Parone was scheduled to talk to Pestaños parents. “He was also a victim of an unsolved murder,” Lim said.  The vessel’s radio operator  PO3 Fidel Tagaytay vanished when summoned to testify.<br> <br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Alam ko po marami siyang alam kasi siya ang duty operator,”</span> (“I know he knew a lot because he was duty operator.”) wife  Leonila wrote to then  Defense Sec. Avelino Cruz. <br><br>Wife Leonila’s efforts to trace Fidel’s whereabouts is brushed off by the bland claim that Tagaytay is AWOL (absent without leave).  Is the radio operator then a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">desaparecido</span>?<br>       <br>“The Pestaño case presents a very strong case against the Ombudsman because it is non-political, says Enrqiue Angeles, who helped the Pestaños shepherd their complain through the  UN Commision on Human Rights. “And the victim is a Philippine Navy officer —not a leftist for a change.” <br><br>An international document, the UN report buttresses credibility of the indictment against the government as state party -- and the Ombudsman which fumbled the ball for the Philippines .” <br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

He just had to state what we had been suspecting all along. <br><br>The excesses of  some government  offices, as well as government-owned and - controlled   corporations are stupendous and scandalous beyond words. <br><br>Among other things that had to be said, what was not said is even more shocking, as the details are still being checked out for veracity and factual support. <br><br>And to this backdrop, P-Noy assures the Filipino people:“Yes, change is coming!”and that it begins with  the commitment to clean up the mess, and make sure it will not happen again. <br><br>Have  we heard this before? What makes it different his time? <br><br>As  surmises and suppositions would go, some hard realities were not spelled out by P-Noy  in his SONA. Knowing the facts presented, and with the unprecedented scale of graft and corruption centered on the leakage of the limited resources of the government coffers, few options are available, and yes, any corrective measure will require more sacrifice for the people. <br><br>As in, there can be no escape from taxes and more efficient tax collection. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hinay-hinay lang,</span> P-Noy! One of the measures that was announced by Kim Henares of the BIR is taxing market vendors, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sari-sari</span> stores, tricycle drivers, and the like, and for them to be mandatorily required to issue receipts for any sale  or revenue from P25 and above.  These are mostly of the informal sector -- the lifeline of the lower-lower class, referred to Class D and E in our economy. <br><br>Firstly,  Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile is questioning its practicability and its implementability. How can they possibly spend time and resources to catch all the supposed violators? <br><br>Secondly,  because most of these persons of the informal sector are unregistered and without any permanent address or location, where will BIR look for them? <br><br>Thirdly, and most importantly, these people are just trying to earn enough income to buy rice and other basic necessities, and if taxes are imposed on their meager sales, where will they go to earn enough to feed themselves and their families? <br><br>This kind of tax measure deserves a second look if this will really solve anything. <br><br>What about the big fish? People were made to believe that if there will be more efficient tax collection from the big income earners, it will surely cover the deficit. <br><br>There has to be some Solomonic wisdom here; will taxes be imposed and sanctions be meted out  on members of the informal sector, or  will such measure be counterproductive and oppressive to those who live on the poverty line and below? <br><br>Government has to remember  that under the present tax regime, no one, not even the poorest of the poor, has escaped the payment of taxes. <br><br>Everytime  a person (employed or unemployed) buys rice, cooking oil, cigarettes, coffee, sugar; rides a tricycle, uses water, switches on electricity, uses professional services, and does all other mundane activities of daily living, he pays 12 percent EVAT (Expanded Value Added Tax). This is the most effective tax collection, and it does not exempt anybody. <br><br>In fact, many are wondering, whatever happened to the katas ng EVAT? <br><br>Read my lips: No new taxes! Please, P-Noy, respond to the needs of the people,  and consider their pleas.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

He will talk on SUAKCREM’s program on marine conservation, particularly on marine protected areas, one of his specialties in marine biology. {{more}}<br><br>Dr. Alcala will also meet with officials of the famous <a href=\"http://www.sheddaquarium.org/\">Shedd Aquarium</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.fieldmuseum.org/\">Field Museum of Natural History. </a><br><br>The Shedd Aquarium has an attractive and successful exhibit on Apo Island, Negros Oriental, considered as a model of marine conservation in the developing world.  Dr. Alcala and Dr. Louella Dolar-Perrin were instrumental in the initial conceptualization of the exhibit at the Shedd more than 15 years ago. <br><br>The Field Museum of Natural History houses a large collection of Philippine natural history specimens (amphibians, reptiles, mammals) studied by Dr. Lawrence Heaney and Dr. Robert Inger, and serving as basis for much of our knowledge of the biodiversity of land vertebrates of the Philippines. Dr. Alcala was a past recipient of a Biodiversity Award of the Field Museum. <br><br>In New Jersey, Dr. Alcala will visit his environmentalist son Moses and his family, and give a lecture on marine protected areas and their benefits to coastal communities of the Philippines. Scientists in the New Jersey area such as those at the Rutgers University Institute of Coastal Studies have been invited to this lecture on Aug. 28.  Sillimanians in the New Jersey-New York area will also attend the lecture. <br><br>In New York City, Dr. Alcala will participate in the final discussions on the Assessment of the Marine Environment to be held in the United Nations offices.

They’re standing there in a hallway waiting for a class to end, or maybe just to get out of the rain. <br><br>Summer is over and life goes on again at school. It’s the rainy season now. Hot blank skies and death-ray sun are slowly giving way to heavy grey overcast and humid air thick enough to drink. And it rains. <br><br>In nations in the North, the end of summer brings autumn –fresh air, clear skies, cool winds. There, life takes on new zest and activity for a while; at least until winter comes again. <br><br>That doesn’t happen here. The Philippines has to wait until the wind shifts to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">amihan</span> and the rains end. <br><br>Rain comes to Dumaguete from June through October or November. The air becomes cool but not fresh. Sickness increases. It doesn’t rain every day, but it might rain at any time. People stay close to shelter, in case it does. Beaches and open spaces are almost empty, even on weekends. Streets are less crowded. Action moves to malls, discos, billiard tables. <br><br>Activity in general becomes quieter; the pace of life, never speedy here, now slows down even more. People tend to move inside their lives in smaller circles than they do in summer, circles restricted to people and places that they already know.  It’s not a time for major shifts. But it can be a time for reflection and internal change. <br><br>In Dumaguete, life picks up again in late October with the beginning of the holiday season. Fiestas, fashion shows, beauty contests all roll out in increasing numbers. People emerge from their rainy days; most of them go on living exactly as they did before. <br><br>But there are a few young people here still not crystallized into final form. These few come out of the season changed in spirit. Listening to the rain has given them time to think differently. <br><br>This girl is looking at a piece of paper; the boy is looking at his cell phone. They’re not looking at each other; why should they? They’re not related by blood; they don’t have the same friends; they have different places to go to after the rain. <br><br>But perhaps on some cool dry afternoon in December, they’ll recognize and remember each other on the street. They’ll smile at each other, and maybe something interesting will happen between them. <br><br> <IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport8-1-10a.jpg\"><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

But they can only do so from their undisposed generating assets,” Engr. Chito Lozano, Noreco 2 engineering department manager.<BR><BR>When the government-owned geothermal plants in Valencia were privatized and bought by GreenCore, the Lopez-owned company could not supply electricity to Noreco 2 because Noreco 2 had a contract with NPC.  And as the NPC lost its power facility in Negros Oriental, it has to get power from Leyte in order to supply Negros Oriental consumers.<BR><BR>“We are banking on NPC for our supply. But our contracted demand with them is just enough for our consumers. If only NPC has power to deliver, we could supply all our needs,” Lozano said.<BR><BR>The limited supply of NPC has led to a deficit of 17.8 megawatts.  While these shortfalls may not be felt in Dumaguete, the Noreco 2 said it was forced to implement rotating brownouts in Dumaguete last July 15 and July 20 lest the entire Visayas grid would shut down.<BR><BR>Another problem caused by having to import power from Leyte is low voltage, which many consumers say have damaged their home appliances.<BR><BR>“We cannot do anything about the low voltage because we are buying a 69KV supply from the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) and as we have monitored our system, during peak hours we even go below 60 KV,” said Engr. Dominador Tragico, head of Noreco 2’s distribution department.  <BR><BR>He said that the 60 KV, once transformed for distribution in the Noreco 2 system, would likewise result in low voltage throughout the Noreco 2 coverage area, especially from 7 to 8 p.m., which are considered the peak consumption hours.<BR><BR>“The best thing to do,” Tragico said, “is to manage our consumption during peak hours. We may suspend the use of washing machines or air conditioners, and transfer to non-peak hours or early morning.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

One was about how a white journalist traced his name to his black roots, and the other was about the continuing struggle of James Blake Miller, a US soldier who took part in the assault on Fallujah, and whose photo by Sinco appeared in newspapers worldwide as the famous <a href=\"http://www.mediastorm.com/publication/the-marlboro-marine\">“Marlboro Man”</a>. <br><br>But Sinco came close to tears as he recalled the horror of the Iraq war, particularly the US assault on Fallujah in 2004, which he covered as an embedded journalist. <br><br>The assault, which was described by some as “worse than Hiroshima” still affects  Sinco every now and then. He was unable to talk while looking at his own photos. <br><br>“I think of Iraq every day. And it still gets to me…,”  “I think of Iraq every day. Sinco said, pausing to compose himself. <br><br>As a photojournalist, Sinco also deplored the practice of some photojournalists who manipulate their photos. “Many journalism students are learning more of Photoshoppe than photography. They learn how to adjust photos to make them more beautiful, when they should actually concentrate on taking photographs and telling a story.” <br><br>He said photojournalists are supposed to take and upload photos with minimum revisions as the photographs should reflect reality. <br><br>Sinco also shared some photos taken by Foundation University visual artist and photographer Hersley Ven Casero and Alma Alcoran who, along with Sinco, had been experimenting on taking panoramic shots of Dumaguete these past few weeks. <br><br>“This kid [Casero] has talent,” Sinco, who first taught Casero to take photos in 2002 with cameras donated by the LA Times, said. <br><br>Sinco, a Dumaguete native, comes home to Dumaguete every year to visit his relatives and to help at Foundation University,  founded by his grandfather Dr. Vicente G.

Sinco — our school’s founder — had been looking on, he would have shook his head as he stood beneath a large welcoming banner that says in bold print “Foundation University is a Zone of Non- violence and Peace.” <br><br>But let’s move past this laughable gathering. <br><br>Let’s walk together into the campus, first passing beneath a banner that exhorts students to develop healthy minds and bodies, another that states our mission to provide quality education to all, and yet, more signs that ask members of our University community to donate a cup of rice each month to those among us who don’t have enough to eat. <br><br>On that same day, something significant transpired inside our lush and inviting campus as academic accreditors from PACUCOA witnessed with deep admiration and respect the progress we have achieved in the last 15 years. <br><br>The school was bankrupt in 1995. Today, those dark days are far behind. <br><br>“We are very impressed by the strong sense of spirituality, morality, and loyalty among your students, faculty, administration and staff,” one accreditor stated in her preliminary findings. “Much of what we have seen and heard is highly commendable.”<br><br>During their three-day tour, the diverse, six- member team of qualified academics, noted our strong management support for faculty development, and our budgetary commitment to continuing the process of improvement. <br><br>They praised our healthy student-centered environment, and they marveled at our impressive laboratories which feature modern facilities for the teaching of information technology, nursing, and sciences. <br><br>They lauded our unique approach of uncompromising personalized attention. <br><br>Foundation University’s library rates among the best in the nation, they said. They liked our idea of digitizing books and learning materials -- and our extensive use of online communication between departments and between teachers and students. <br><br>They were amazed by our progress towards becoming a completely “paperless” university. They wished that their own campuses had the same extensive WIFI coverage. <br><br>Best of all, they just loved the campus. Period. <br><br>They confessed that our facilities are far superior to those of many elite Manila schools. We made them feel welcome. They wondered how all this could have materialized at a non-stock, non-profit, and non-sectarian institution. <br><br>Basically, we told them that it wasn’t easy — that it has been the result of vision, commitment, consensus, and just plain hard work. <br><br>This group is affiliated with the Philippine Commission on Higher Education, and they have virtually assured us we will be granted Level 3 accreditation in the coming weeks, allowing us to be semi-autonomous in developing future programs and more new facilities. <br><br>Be assured that we are not resting on our laurels. We now set our sights on the full autonomy that comes with achieving Level 4 accreditation, the highest granted educational institutions in the Philippines. <br><br>Yes, we need to beef up our research component. And we will. Our relevance to our community and society depends on it. This is our highest goal. <br><br>Recently, we have embarked on joint ventures with the Buglass Institute in Dauin, as well as another industrial partners seeking to create a center for computer sciences right here in Dumaguete. <br><br>We are also exploring a program of micro-financing that focuses on small and sustainable production ventures that will have an end market that benefits all involved. <br><br>Because our agricultural programs emphasize organic food production, we have been invited by the Negros Island Sustainable Agriculture & Rural Development (NISARD) Board to spearhead its programs in the Central Visayan region. <br><br>These projects will expand research opportunities for our students and faculty, and make us ever more indispensable and vital to our community. <br><br>Today, we press on with a vision imagined long ago. We encourage people to get past their preconceived notions of Foundation University. We strive daily to provide an education unmatched anywhere in the islands. We present you an experience unquantifiable in monetary terms alone. <br><br>Earlier this month, the Foundation University community participated in the first ever Dal-uy Festival of Hope on the Dumaguete waterfront. Thousands of us launched little floats decorated with candles, and inscribed with our wishes for the future. It was a sight to behold. <br><br>Under a bright display of bursting fireworks, I thought of my late father and grandfather. <br><br>The water lapped gently at my feet as innumerable floats illuminated the darkness all around. I wished for my ancestors to be proud of all of us at Foundation U. Just then, a cool, gentle breeze swept past and at that moment, I knew they were. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Luis Leandro D.

Right there and then, I witnessed and was captivated by one of the most beautiful smiles I have ever seen.  That was Elsie’s smile. It was hardly a smile that would qualify for a toothpaste commercial. All you could see were her gums and a few front teeth that have been eaten up and blackened by decay. But boy! was it beautiful!! It brightened up her entire face and shone with all the innocence that only children could muster.  But it was more than that. Elsie’s smile that day radiated her joy and excitement at the thought that she was going to have another dress. <br><br>You see, Elsie just recently arrived at Casa Cittadini – Home for Girls. She only had one set of clothes that day she came in ... the very ones on her back. She had to borrow from the other girls during her first few days at Casa. When Sister Celina was finally able to buy her one dress, she asked a question that was of utmost importance to her: did she still have to return that dress? <br><br>That day when Sister handed her my daughter’s old dress, Elsie’s smile showed her joy as she finally understood – that dress was going to be hers alone. Nobody was going to take it back. Today, Elsie continues to smile with that same contagious, joyous smile of hers.  I would like to believe that it is a reflection of her inner joy and contentment.  Having been taken in by the Ursuline Sisters at Casa Cittadini, she now lives a much better life. <br><br>Elsie’s life had not always been this good.  At her tender age, Elsie already knows how it feels like to be abandoned by her own mother.  Yes, tiny Elsie, who at age six looks no bigger than a four year old, has seen some of the worst that life has to offer.  She still talks about her baby sister whom her father gave up for adoption due to poverty.  And at that age, Elsie learned to cook rice by herself.  Her case study reveals that their father often had to leave her and her brothers a week at a time because of his work.  During these times, the children learned to survive on their own, sleep unaccompanied by an adult in a filthy shanty wearing the same unwashed clothes for days on end, and yes, cook rice when there was rice to be cooked. <br><br>But all that is behind her. Elsie now lives at Casa Cittadini along with 25 other girls under the care of Sister Celina and Sister Maria Fe. They all go to school and have a safe, secure, and loving home to return to each day where nutritious meals and clean, warm beds await. <br><br>Elsie is but one girl.  But her life mirrors that of the 25 other girls whose life stories do not differ from Elsie’s. But fate brought them to Casa. Now they have a better shot at a future that is full of promise. <br><br>There are more institutions like Casa Cittadini that provide the same kind of service to disadvantaged children around Negros Oriental. Little Children of the Philippines, GWAVE, and GP Rehab are but a few of the non-governmental organizations that are actively working right now for these children’s welfare. <br><br>There was a time when these organizations worked individually and independent of each other and with little or no knowledge of the others’ existence.  The idea to bring them together under an umbrella organization to maximize their effectiveness and to enable them to share their resources and expertise in their respective fields came up and thus, the Oriental Negros Children’s Advocacy Network (ONCAN) was formed.  Under the Presidency of Baby Jambora of Chapel of the Doves, ONCAN is a fully functioning network made up of more than 30 member NGOs.  It is actively working towards the advancement of its members’ capabilities and capacities with the end in view of maximizing their potential for the benefit of all the children under their care. <br><br>There are thousands more of little Elsies out there. And each of them is receiving the same kind of care and nurturing that Elsie of Casa Cittadini is getting. But the sad reality remains that there are probably hundreds of thousands more out there who have not been reached by the members of ONCAN yet. They have a daunting task ahead of them, but having seen their dedication and commitment, I am certain that they will get there. <br><br>If you wish to get involved, you may email me or visit the websites: <a href=\"mailto:http://www.oncan.org/CasaCittadini/CasaCittadini.htm\">http://www.oncan.org/CasaCittadini/CasaCittadini.htm</a>.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br><br>        <img src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Elsiesmile.jpg\" align=\"LEFT\"\" border=\"0\"><br><br>(ONCAN is hiring a full-time psychologist to do counselling and evaluation of children who have been victimized, abused, or traumatized.  Salary range is P10,000 to P30,000 depending on qualifications. If you are interested, please email me so I could give you more details.

There were no survivors from among  the 52 passengers and eight crewmembers on board.<br /><br />“This happened 47 years ago, but for us in the scouting movement, this is as significant as though it happened yesterday,” Dumaguete Mayor Manuel Sagarbarria, in a speech read for him by City Administrator William Ablong, said.<br /><br />The Negros Oriental Boy Scout Council holds yearly activities to mark Scout Memorial Day, either through floral offerings at the Magbanua tomb at the Dumaguete Memorial Park or fronting his life-size statue at the BSP Headquarters at the Capitol Area in Dumaguete City.<br /><br />Sagarbarria, who was also a Boy Scout in his younger years, said the heroism of Scout Magbanua continues to live in every scout today through the tenets of scouting.<br /><br />He said Magbanua’s example should serve as an inspiration to all scouts, not only in Dumaguete City and Negros Oriental but throughout the country.<br /><br />“While most of us gathered here today never got to know who Scout Jojo Magbanua was, we can see that he continues to live in the life of every Boy and Girl Scout for he lived by the Scout Oath and Law.”<br /><br />As part of the yearly Scout Memorial Day activity, the Magbanua family awarded six Senior Scouts from the Negros Oriental Council the Scout Jose Fermin Magbanua Achievement Awards in recognition for their performance and contribution to scouting. <br /><br />On that same day, the Negros Oriental BSP Executive Board inducted the newly-elected Board Members representing the private sector.<br /><br />This year's private sector representatives are Rev. Andres Legaspi (religious sector); Col. Jose Valencia (youth development); KBP Chapter Chairman Roy August Bustillo (media); Rotary Council of Presidents Chairman Atty. Neil Ray Lagahit (civic sector); Amlan Mayor Bentham dela Cruz (local government); Dumaguete City Prosecutor Eliezer Escorial (professional sector); Perpetual Help Credit Cooperative Inc. Manager Michael Johann Hojas (banking/business); Negros Oriental State University President Dr. Henry Sojor (education/academe), and Alex Amor Jr.(agriculture/environmental development).<br /><br />The BSP Executive Board also reelected Judge Victor Patrimonio (ret.) as chairman. Other elected officers are Alex Pal, 1st vice chairman; Alex Kong, 2nd vice chairman; Wilkie Matiao, treasurer; Dionisio Ramirez, assistant treasurer; Sergio Tamayo, auditor, and Acting Council Scout Executive Philambrichi Magos, secretary.<br /><br /><img src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/BoyScouts7-28-10.jpg\"  \"=\"\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" align=\"LEFT\" /><br />BSP Negros Oriental Council Vice Chairman Alex Pal, BSP Vice President for the Visayas Atty.

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br />NEW YORK — As we remember the 1963 crash of the plane carrying Filipino scouts on the way to the 11th World Jamboree in Greece, one person attaches a more personal connection to the incident, and a more poignant perspective on the commemorations held annually.{{more}}<br /><br />Jonathan Badoy spends July 28 each year as a day of reflection on the meaning of life, a time to offer special thanks for extraordinary blessings, and an occasion to honor those who perished in that tragic incident.<br /><br />“When I was still in Dumaguete, I always made it a point to attend the ceremonies at the Boy Scout Headquarters to honor Jojo Magbanua and the rest of the Philippine contingent,” said Jonathan, who now lives in New York City with his wife Brenda. <br /><br />Jonathan had a personal link to the 24 ill-fated scouts: he was supposed to be the 25th member of the delegation.<br /><br /><div>Along with Jojo Magbanua, his fellow First Class Scout in Troop 37 of SU High School, Jonathan was among those chosen to comprise the Philippine delegation to the World Jamboree.<br /><br /><br /><script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--<br><br>google_ad_client = \"pub-4414480388811847\";<br><br>/* 468x60, created 11/16/10 */<br><br>google_ad_slot = \"0691524832\";<br><br>google_ad_width = 468;<br><br>google_ad_height = 60;<br><br>//--><br><br></script><br><br><script type=\"text/javascript\"<br><br>src=\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js\"><br><br></script><br /></div><div>&nbsp;</div>“I was ready to go; Jojo and I were excited,” said Badoy. “The upcoming trip was heralded in the national newspapers, and our names and pictures were printed all over, along with the rest of the delegation. There were to have been 25 of us.”<br /><br />But by some twist of fate, Jonathan learned from his father a few days before departure that the family was unable to raise the money needed for the trip. “I was disheartened, but then I just consoled myself with the reality that it was way beyond the capacity of my father, a UCCP minister, to come up with that kind of money,” Jonathan reconciled.<br /><br />So, the then-14-year-old boy stayed in Dumaguete, as the Philippine contingent enplaned for Greece without him. Hard as he tried to train his thoughts on his classes, his mind would helplessly wander on the trip that could have been – the thrill of getting on a giant airplane, the adventure of visiting other places, the excitement of meeting thousands of scouts from all over the world. The World Jamboree was to be the ultimate experience, especially for someone like Jonathan, who had been involved in scouting for as long as he could remember.<br /><br />And then came news on the radio that shocked the whole country and stunned the world. The United Arab Airlines plane plunged into the sea off the coast of Bombay, India, killing all the 24 members of the Philippine contingent.<br /><br />Jonathan remembers it very well: “I was in school, surrounded by my teachers, when I learned of the tragedy. They broke the news to me, and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I was shaking uncontrollably, and as I sobbed the teachers all hugged me reassuringly. I remember it was my fellow scout Emmanuel Mancao who kept me company the rest of the afternoon and walked me home. He stayed with me late into the night as I tried to gain my composure.” It was to be a long, arduous healing process, only made easier with the help and concern of family and friends.<br /><br />“I should have been dead already,” Jonathan today reflects. “But I think God still has a purpose for me, that’s why I was spared. This incident has given me a deeper appreciation of life and its meaning.”<br /><br />He has since endeavored to live his life in accordance with the Boy Scout Law, and offered his services in promoting scouting. He was instrumental in organizing the Explorer Scouts at SUHS and later the Sea Scouts in college. He actively participated in scout gatherings, most notably as Senior Patrol Leader of the Negros Oriental delegation to the 3rd National Jamboree in Cebu City in 1965.<div class=\"google_ad\"><script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--<br><br>google_ad_client = \"ca-pub-4414480388811847\";<br><br>/* Mobile-image only-200sq */<br><br>google_ad_slot = \"7126208071\";<br><br>google_ad_width = 200;<br><br>google_ad_height = 200;<br><br>//--><br><br></script><br><br><script type=\"text/javascript\"<br><br>src=\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js\"><br><br></script><br><br></div><br /><br />With his convivial demeanor, Jonathan is now able to make light of that fateful  incident. He relishes with impish amusement the story that in every affair in recent years at the Boy Scout Headquarters, Alex Amor, Jr. would always pull him forward and announce, “If you want to see what Jojo Magbanua looks like today, just look at Jonathan Badoy.” Alex may have said it half-kiddingly, but Dumaguete scouting circles affectionately associate Jonathan with Jojo, and gatherings are always honored by his presence.<br /><br />Over the years, Jonathan has endeared himself even more to the Magbanua family, who dote on him as an apt personification of their lost son. “I appreciate the love showered by the Magbanuas; it keeps me connected with and always cherish the memory of my friend Jojo, who was like a brother to me,” confides Jonathan.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Related story:</span><br style=\"font-family: Arial;\" /><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/magbanua-heroism-extolled-p326-300.htm\">Magbanua heroism extolled</a></span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> <script type=\"text/javascript\"><!--<br><br>google_ad_client = \"ca-pub-4414480388811847\";<br><br>/* Banner */<br><br>google_ad_slot = \"0102241469\";<br><br>google_ad_width = 468;<br><br>google_ad_height = 60;<br><br>//--><br><br></script><br><br><script type=\"text/javascript\"<br><br>src=\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js\"><br><br></script><br /><br /><br /><br />         <span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #008000;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br />         <br />         <div><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/metropost\" _mce_href=\"http://www.facebook.com/metropost\"><img src=\"https://imgssl.constantcontact.com/ui/images1/btn_fbk_160_a.png\" _mce_src=\"https://imgssl.constantcontact.com/ui/images1/btn_fbk_160_a.png\" alt=\"Like us on Facebook\" title=\"Like us on Facebook\" align=\"null\" border=\"0\" /></a>      <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/joelpal\" _mce_href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/joelpal\"><img src=\"https://imgssl.constantcontact.com/ui/images1/btn_twit_160.png\" _mce_src=\"https://imgssl.constantcontact.com/ui/images1/btn_twit_160.png\" alt=\"Follow us on Twitter\" title=\"Follow us on Twitter\" align=\"null\" border=\"0\" /></a>      <a _mce_href=\"http://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/email.jsp?m=$ACCOUNT.UID$\" href=\"http://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=lqicgejab&p=oi&m=1109315887627\" _mce_shape=\"rect\" shape=\"rect\"><img alt=\"\" _mce_src=\"https://imgssl.constantcontact.com/letters/images/1101093164665/jmml_1a.gif\" src=\"https://imgssl.constantcontact.com/letters/images/1101093164665/jmml_1a.gif\" style=\"border: medium none;\" border=\"0\" height=\"35\" vspace=\"10\" width=\"116\" /></a><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://www.dumaguetemetropost.com\"><br />         </a><br />         <div>&nbsp;</div><br />         <div>&nbsp;</div><br /></div></body></html><br><br>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>DUMAGUETE CITY -- With four universities and seven colleges for a population of less than 150,000, Dumaguete proudly banners the moniker of being a “University Town.” The learning people get from these educational institutions is among the country’s best.{{more}}<br><br>But not everything that goes around in this city feeds the brain. Sometimes, it’s just plain gossip, like this oft-repeated story that keeps going around the social and drinking circles even two weeks after it supposedly happened.<br><br>The story has been discussed once too often that many Dumagueteños can casually walk up to another and ask: “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tinuod ba ‘to</span> (Is it true)?” No further words are necessary. They both just know exactly what they’re talking about.<br><br>The story is about two consenting adults carrying on an illicit affair, who were out on an early morning tryst at a local hotel. Suddenly, to their horror, they discovered that their bodies involuntarily held together tight.   And, as the story goes, the couple had to be rushed to the Holy Child Hospital that morning of Friday, July 23, wrapped in a blanket.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Wildfire</span><br><br>No one knows how the rumor started, but news about the supposed incident over a local radio station converted the rumor into gospel truth. <br><br>In a restaurant here that day, customers were not immediately interested to order some food but to avail of the restaurant’s WiFi connection and Google up the term “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">vaginismus</span>”.  Another one volunteered to try Wikipedia for the term “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">penis-captivus</span>”.<br><br>News then spread through text and by word of mouth, as the initial crowd of about 20 people outside the hospital got bigger by the minute.  Suddenly, everyone had a story to tell: that the lady victim was a co-worker of a friend, or a man comes forward claiming to know the male victim because he lives in the same barangay as he. A bartender also fed the flame further by claiming that he was able to slip into the operating room pretending to be a relative and actually saw the couple still locked in an uncompromising position.<br><br>“This is Jerry Springer material happening right here,” said a balikbayan who seemed to be enjoying listening to the people in the next table.  He was referring to a US tabloid TV talk show host who has a flair for uncensored topics.<br><br>Fueling the rumor further was the sight of about five reporters with TV and still cameras entering the Holy Child Hospital at around 11 a.m. of that day to visit a sick colleague.<br><br>“When we arrived, we noticed that people were congregated in groups outside the hospital and talking in whispers. We didn’t know what was happening,” said Maricar Aranas, reporter of Fil Products Service TV and secretary general of the National Union of Journalists in the Philippines (NUJP) Dumaguete chapter.<br><br>As they were going to their colleague’s room, they noticed some people following them. “While we were inside our colleague’s room, some people even opened the door to look at our patient,” Aranas said, laughing.<br><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Versions</span><br><br>There are several versions of the rumor, depending on who one talks with. The most common yarn that was broadcast over the radio was that the woman was a teacher in one of the Dumaguete schools whose husband is an overseas contract worker, while the man was a tricycle driver.  The woman reportedly committed suicide by slashing her wrist to avoid further embarrassment, according to people who claimed to have direct communication with people inside the operating room.  <br><br>The Dumaguete City Police Office made its own investigation as the rumor reached higher headquarters.  “I was asked by my superiors for a report and so I submitted a report which said the whole thing was just a rumor,” said Chief Insp. Errol Garchitorena, the OIC of the Dumaguete police.<br><br>He said that while the ruckus was going on, he sent investigators to the hospital, the hotel and the school and there was no evidence to support the rumor.  The police were starting to complain as well, as traffic stood at a standstill at the area fronting the hospital after tricycle drivers stopped and left their tricycles on the street to investigate the cause of the commotion. And this went on until the early evening.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Denial</span><br><br>Despite official denials, the rumors continued to circulate by text messaging or by word of mouth. This prompted the lay administrators of St. Paul University of Dumaguete, one of the schools rumored to be the employer of the woman,  to file a complaint before the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas against the radio reporter who, they said, spread the story without confirming its veracity.<br><br>In a statement posted on its Facebook page last Monday, SPUD assured the public that all their teaching and non-teaching personnel are all accounted for.  “The irresponsible news item is utterly false and without basis,” the statement said.<br><br>The school also threatened to file administrative, civil and criminal action against those responsible for the defamatory allegation, because “the news report has caused us humiliation and besmirched reputation, which to our mind deserves rectification. “<br><br>Roy August Bustillo, station manager of DYSR-FM, who is the KBP Dumaguete Chapter chairman, said they have given the reporter, Dions Manaban of DYGB-FM, until August 6 to submit his written reply to the complaint.<br><br>But despite the denials and damage control, the one person who probably wants to see an immediate end to this rumor is City Mayor Manuel Sagarbarria, who prides himself as the City’s salesman. “This ugly rumor should stop. Anyway, this has already been belied.”  He said he fears that should this continue, Dumaguete might lose its moniker as a University Town and instead be known by an ugly nickname.<br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The stories were then screened and critiqued by the Probe Media producers led by Booma Cruz, and the College of Mass Communication faculty. <BR>The workshop was a part of Probe Media’s advocacy to train future media practitioners on responsible journalism. It was also a build-up to the Probe and the UN Millennium Campaign’s Search for the Philippines’ MDG Warriors student competition to be held in September 2010.<BR><BR>SU College of Mass Communication Dean Dr. Ma. Cecilia M.

Antonio, a junior Mass Communication student,  said the workshop became an eye-opener for a budding media practitioner like her. “I realized that my future job isn’t at all easy. But if I want to be an expert in the TV production field like the Probe Team, I have to have the heart and willingness to learn…and that’s exactly what I learned in the workshop.”  <BR><BR>“We definitely learned more things that we could add to the things we’ve already learned in our classes,” said Hannah Leah M. Pa-a, a senior. “I think this workshop came in real handy especially for graduating students like me who are considering on taking a chance on the TV production industry.”<BR><BR>Probe Media is a non-stock, non-profit organization committed to improving the quality of media in the Philippines and Asia-Pacific through training of professional and aspiring media practitioners.<BR>The workshop was organized in partnership with Probe Productions Inc., an independent TV production company in the country, best known for pioneering the investigative news-magazine format on Philippine television through the show Probe.

Believe it or not, we do not fully know.<br><br>Consider the report on the three round-table discussions led by the National Academy of Science and Technology in 2010. It was reported that in 2003, the total area of forest in the country was 5.932 million hectares. The area jumped to 7.168 million in 2003. It is unbelievable that in two years the forest grew by 1.236 million hectares. A mature forest takes several decades to develop. A National Scientist, in responding to this statistics, sarcastically said that the Philippine forest area as reported must have included fruit trees planted by people in their yards!<br><br>But let us ask further questions. Do these figures include plantations and secondary forests in the various seral stages? If the figures are based on satellite imagery, was there an attempt to ground-truth the estimates? If the answer to the latter question is no, then there is much room for doubt. <br><br>Every man on the street knows that our forests have always been the target of environmental violations such as kaingin for farming and illegal (even legal) tree cutting for lumber. Our experience while conducting fieldwork in rainforests of the country for more than 30 years is that appearance of a closed forest canopy seen at a far distance often gives a false image because the inside portion of that forest had actually been logged or cleared for farming. These practices have contributed to the highest rate of deforestation among the six countries of the Coral Triangle area. The importance of conducting ground-truth checks is evident.<br><br>In 1998, the area of primary (also referred to as old-growth or climax) forest was estimated at 1.78 million hectares, consisting mostly of submontane and montane (mossy) forests. If this figure is correct, it is impossible to have 5.932 million hectares of climax forest within five years in 2003. Original climax forest consists of lowland (dipterocarp) at sea level to ca 800 meters altitude or above sea level, and mid-mountain or submontane forest and  montane or mossy forest at higher altitudes up to 2,000-3,000 meters. It is known that in most of the Philippines, the lowland forest has almost disappeared entirely, and a large proportion of the mid-mountain forest is under cultivation by upland communities. In brief, there is reason to doubt the estimates of 6-7 million hectares of forest in the Philippines. The burden of proof is on those who made these estimates, considered inaccurate by many.<br><br>For the marine environment, there is some agreement. It is widely admitted that coastal areas are severely degraded. Mangrove forests have been reduced to less than 100,000 hectares, and the remaining “good” remnants have been heavily logged. As everybody knows, much of mangrove areas have been converted into fishponds, human settlements, and industrial areas.  Another type of forest, beach forest, in the country no longer exists; it has been converted to human settlements. Coral reefs have been badly battered, and only less than 10% of the total area remains in good condition.<br><br>The degradation of coastal ecosystems has had dire consequences on the marine biodiversity considered the source of basic food for 60% of our population. I have been repeating several times that not more than 10% of the original biomass of fish (100-150 tons/square kilometer) that existed in coastal areas 30-40 years ago presently exists today. What is frightening is that coastal communities continue to extract from what remains, leading to a collapse of coastal fisheries in the very near future. A good case of species extinction is the chambered nautilus in Tañon Strait between Cebu and Negros Islands. Ultimately, extinctions of certain species of fish will occur, as indicated by the disappearance in fishermen catch of some 20 pelagic species around Bohol Island according to one published report.<br><br>The government, local and national, must address the problem of depletion of marine biodiversity, including fishery species, immediately by such interventions as establishment of more marine protected areas, restricted fishing in certain coastal areas or during specific times, replanting of mangroves in depleted areas, full protection of at least 20-30% of our marine ecosystems, control of coastal pollution from domestic and industrial wastes, etc.<br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

So, what  will  President  Benigno  Aquino do with the sleaze legacy his predecessor  dumped?  <br> <br> The  Philippines ranked 141, out of  179 countries,  gauged by Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index . “<br><br> The Supreme Court forfeited Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos’s ill-gotten wealth,  Columnist Rene Saguisag  recalls.. Imelda  ran for Congress.  “The ‘ill-gottener’  was not  prosecuted “Theft of  billions established...without  a thief. Wotta  country” .<br> <br> Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez   found no one liable for the P1.4 billion Mega Pacfici computer election scam. Crime without criminals. Onli in da Pilipins?<br><br> Aquino  stumbles  across graft everywhere. Yet,  gross trust  in (him) was 88 percent,  Social Weather Stations notes. “Current trust in  Aquino could be called not only very broad but also very deep.”<br><br>Citizens are essential to beat  back grafters. Among these  are “whistleblowers” who  risk jobs, ostracism,  sometimes  life, to expose crime. Like the person who slipped  Aquino  a 10-page excerpt of the “Mayuga Report”.<br> <br>Written by Vice Adm. Mateo Mayuga, the report  probed into roles of  generals in 2004’s tainted elections  Gens. Hermogenes  Esperon, Roy Kyamko,  Gabriel Habacon and Francisco Gudani have retired. <br><br>The Arroyo regime stamped the report  “top secret”.  But Aquino  pledged full  disclosure and  action. History is on his side.  <br><br>Daniel  Ellsberg leaked  to New York Times and Washington Post the “Pentagon Papers”. That compelled a review of the Vietnam war, President Richard  Nixon invoked  the Espionage Act of 1917 and got injunctions to gag  Ellbserg and newspapers. <br><br> “The injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraint,” By a  6-3 vote, the US  Supreme  Court held  by a 6-3 vote.  ”Government failed to meet the heavy burden of proof required for prior restraint.”<br><br>What  if  the  Mayuga Report leaks  or  is blocked from release? Would  the  Arroyo Supreme Court  back  transparency, as the  American high court  did? <br>Journalist   Marites Danguilan Vitug  provides leads  in her  new book  “Project 2010: Confronting the Legacy of the GMA Regime”. Vitug  wrote the earlier award-winning book:: “Shadow of Doubt – Probing the Supreme Court.” <br><br>Aquino  inherits  “a Court led by her former aide and packed with her appointees, most of whom have shown allegiance to her,” Vitug says. Media were barred when Corona took his oath as Chief Justice.  <br><br>“The hiding of an oath-taking, a very public act, says much”, \\Vitug says.. “ Corona’s mindset actually shows a weak bent toward transparency and disclosure of information.”.  <br><br>Arroyo’s  former chief of staff  voted in favor of government secrecy in keystone  cases:  the overpriced ZTE   $329-million national broadband network; executive privilege for  NEDA Secretary Romulo Neri; Corona  thumbed down disclosure of detailed information, by the Commission on Elections, on  technical preparations for  automated polls.. In 2008, he backed  those who’d  stop airing the “Hello, Garci” tapes.<br><br>“Governments must create an environment that encourages, instead of penalizing, citizens who denounce venality,” declared 135 countries at  the 9th International Anti-Corruption Conference in Durham, South Africa. The Philippines dutifully signed that document.  <br><br>A decade after Durham, “the kind and extent of support that a legitimate whistleblower should be able to expect (remains) unclear”, says the Asian Institute of Management study: “Whistle Blowing in the Philippines: Awareness, Attitudes and Structures”. <br><br>Whistleblowers here  are threatened, harassed or murdered. Take three high-profile  cases.<br><br>Acsa Ramirez exposed Land Bank tax scandals. NBI agents shoved her instead  into a police lineup  while cameras panned on President Gloria  Macapagal Arroyo’s smile. That photo op squelched a thousand potential whistleblowers.  Until  the day  she left  Malacanang,  Ms Arroyo never apologized.<br><br>Ensign  Philip  Pestaño  refused to allow  loading of illegal lumber and shabu on RPS Bacolod in 1995.. “Suicide”, the Navy ruled within 24 hours after his body was found..  “Murder”, concluded a probe, led by the late Senate president Marcelo Fernan.<br><br>Ombudsman Gutierrez  refused to meet the parents of Pestano. But new Justice Secretary Leila de Lima confers with  them today.  Secretary de Lima earlier  released  the March ruling of the UN Commission on Human Rights: Pestano’s  murder “was attributable to the State in Party” (i.e. the Phiippines). <br><br>No one has been prosecuted for a crime committed with impunity. The  Commission asks (the Philippines) to “undertake enforceable remedies” and inform the UN “within 180 days of steps taken”.<br><br>Whistleblowers,  like Antonio Calipjo-Go, slam  against  shekel  power. For over a decade, he skewered error-studded textbooks.  Education Department issued a  28-page booklet, to more than half a million public school teachers  correcting  more than 450 errors found in 10 English textbooks,:  Go also  pinpointed errors in science textbooks.  <br><br>Publishers and corrupt officials choreographed a smear campaign against Go.  Accord Go “the right of reply”, the Philippine Press Council asked. Go’s  rejoinders were ignored. This is failure at self-regulation by individual newspapers fracture ethical codes..  <br><br>Shekel power will  seek to undercut P-Noy’s pledge to end the “ ultimate perversion” : a system that beatifies  crooks and  crucifies  those who seek  fair play. Our grandchildren are at stake here.<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

They’re installing roof supports of unusually interesting design in a building of some architectural merit; they’re working with efficient modern tools under safe conditions; and they’re actually working, on a job that promises to keep them for some time to come.<br><br>The roof supports are for a building at Foundation University designed by Victor Sinco, an architect and also a trustee of the school. He has developed a consistent style of his own for the campus, based on local organic forms -of which these supports are an example. (It’s true that he’s my boss at work, but that’s beside the point. If I didn’t like his work I wouldn’t feature it here.)<br><br>This kind of work can’t be done by methods that are common here. To build like this with any accuracy and speed you need modern power tools and skilled people like this to operate them. What you see on the streets is quite different -- large groups of people slowly drilling or breaking concrete with hammers and nails. A short stretch can take a dozen men a week to break, work that one man with a jackhammer could do in a single day. It’s an embarrassingly primitive and crude way of working.<br><br>But it has a crude logic. Although it looks crazy to see a lot of grown men banging at cement with hammers and nails, it does keep them employed -- at minimum wages, so at least they’re off the streets; and a jackhammer and compressor would probably cost more than what they earn in a year.<br><br>You can do a lot with unskilled labor and crude tools, if it’s simple work and you don’t care how long it takes. But there’s a hidden cost. The men you hire may be unskilled, but they’re not stupid. They know the work can be done better and faster, and that they’re only there because they’re cheap. So they work slowly, waste time, and don’t care very much about the result.<br><br>The men in this picture are different- you can see in their faces that they are focused on their work, and take pride in doing it well. When the building is finished, they can look  at it and know they’ve helped to make something of lasting value, and will value themselves the more for that. That’s what work should be about. <br><br><img src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport8-8-10.jpg\" align=\"LEFT\" border=\"0\"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>LEGAZPI CITY, ALBAY -- The challenge of adapting to Climate Change may be difficult for many local chief executives but for the affable Albay Gov.Joey Salceda,  all it takes is a lot of common sense.{{more}}<BR><BR>“We’re the only province with no casualty during the recent typhoons because we’re the only province to issue a no-sail order.  90 percent of deaths during typhoons were caused by drowning at sea. So the solution is simple,” Salceda told the visiting members of the Philippine Network of Environmental Journalists.<BR><BR>Albay, which has been pioneering in programs that would lessen the worsening impact of global warming through mitigation programs as well as in educating the community to take care of the environment, was declared a Champion Climate Change Steward by the United Nations last June.<BR>Salceda, who has been credited for weaving the successful economic policies of then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo,  weaves around the government bureaucracy in implementing this pioneering program.<BR><BR>The secret, he reveals, is in how you position yourself. “This is the Republic of Albay. We behave like a republic. I look at the Philippines like the European Union and we’re like Switzerland.”<BR><BR>Imagination, after all, is what Salceda has a lot of as he steers his province into largely unchartered waters.<BR>For instance, part of the efforts of the provincial government to reduce the incidences of child mortality is to educate the people on family planning.<BR><BR>“If we want to lessen child mortality, we should also teach the people how not to have children,” Salceda said. At 1.4 percent, Albay already has a low population growth rate. And the number may even go down further.<BR><BR>Among the many awards Albay is expected to receive this year are the citations for having the best Provincial and City Disaster Coordination Councils in the country.<BR><BR>Lessons learned from recent disasters indicate that Filipinos need social preparation in order to effectively respond to disasters. “Nobody can match the intensity and consistency and the passion of the entire Albay province in terms of social preparation,” Salceda boasts. And rightly so.<BR><BR>“Our people are well-trained and well advised.  They know the vulnerabilities. That is a common threat that binds us as a community. We know we are vulnerable to disaster but we can do something about it,” he said.<BR><BR>“Half of the fatalities during typhoon Ondoy did not have to die,” Salceda said, as he noted that people seemed unmindful of the danger and went ahead to do what they did. <BR>“They knew it was flooding, they waded just the same. There was a flood, but the people insisted on driving through it.  They went up their roofs but they did not even bring water, food, or clothing.  They could have starved to death. They needed social preparation.”<BR><BR>Albay is no exception to the lack of funds and to go around this problem, Salceda turns to external funding partners.<BR>Last Thursday, the Province of Albay received a P480 million grant from the  Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica) for the construction of six multi-storey permanent evacuation centers which would also serve as classrooms.<BR><BR>Salceda says the project is the biggest single investment in disaster mitigation in the country.<BR><BR>“Jica’s financial grant is the single biggest assistance given by the Japanese government in addressing the province’s “zero casualty” goal in times of disaster such as during eruptions of Mayon Volcano, flooding, lahar flows and landslides,” Salceda adds.<BR><BR>Another secret to assuring zero casualty rates in times of disasters is to assure the evacuees of support in their evacuation centers so they won’t unnecessarily expose themselves to the natural dangers. <BR><BR>“They are given five kilos of rice in the evacuation centers so they won’t leave,” Salceda says.<BR><BR>Evacuation assistance is their right, Salceda says, as it becomes his duty as governor of the Province. <BR>Albay’s Climate Change protocol is also starting to gain more ground, as the provinces of Saranggani, Pampanga and Sorsogon have replicated  the Albay Disaster Management Plan.<BR><BR>It may not be long before the rest of the country does. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

There are no jingles, no catchy phrases, no “cool” hand gestures. They are just plain angry political ads enumerating the reasons why voters shouldn’t vote for a certain party.<br><br>It can get annoying. <br><br>This is the first ever election when I can finally have my direct say on who gets to lead this pleasant land. The problem is I have no idea who to vote for. I am totally stumped and I am grappling for guidance. <br><br>I used to have a solid decision for a party favourite. I was a Labor party voter all the way even if I had doubts with some of their policies. Then several weeks ago, the party’s ugly side came out in the open.  For the first time in Australian history, a party leader, and the country’s prime minister at that, was booted out by its own party members. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was stabbed in the back, leaving him no choice but to “step down to avoid a humiliating defeat”, according to news stories.<br><br>His party decided that his deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard should take over the reigns. And so she replaced him and became Australia’s first ever female PM. Wohoo? Not. Although I am a woman, I am not proud that the country’s Prime Minister is a woman. What the whole situation says to me is that the only way a woman could ever become prime minister is by snaking someone else and grabbing the power by force. It’s nasty, it’s treacherous and so not the side I want to see in a female leader. It gives me visions of cat claws ripping bunny innards. But then again, maybe that IS the real face of Australian politics and I just never saw it until now.<br><br>After that, of course, more controversies followed. Apparently someone leaked some documents stating not very flattering information about the new prime minister. She opposed several important policies like paid parental leave and an increase in pension payment. There are suspicions the leak was someone from Rudd’s staff (or maybe Rudd himself) but the journalist who came out with it wouldn’t tell (good on him!).<br><br>Personally, my respect for Rudd wouldn’t waver if it turns out he did leak the documents. If I’ve been seriously screwed by my own people, the same people who not long ago was all for promoting the Kevin 07 platform, I’d draw some blood too (figuratively speaking, of course….. I guess). I was even hoping he’d switch sides and move to the Liberal party just to make matters even worse for Labor. But he’s not me, and I’m not powerful (I’m too vindictive, no one should really give me any power).<br><br>I do feel bad for Mr Rudd. His own people did not give him much of a chance. They were unforgiving of his latest blunders and they obviously decided not to give him time to correct them. Very unforgiving. At least Filipinos give their leaders a couple of years to prove themselves before doing another Edsa.<br><br>So now the election has been called and the current PM is busy carrying babies and getting photos with them. Both sides are throwing dirt at each other, hoping the voters would make up their minds.<br><br>My first election as a voter and I am stuck between the devil and a very hard place. At least when I used to vote in the Philippines I knew what I was doing. Every election, since the day I could vote, my political selection has always been based on whom my father picked. He is a strong political analyst and researches the candidates carefully. When I arrived in Australia and had to vote for a Philippine election I would email my father his thoughts and he would send me his views. It was always an easy pick for me. And yes, we always agreed on the choices even when I became a journalist and did research about the candidates myself.<br><br>But now I’m on my own and Papa is not here to guide me. So what will I do come election day? Simple. Vote Green. At least I’m sure they stand for the environment and you can’t go wrong with that. Thank God for minor political parties.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The words of the Lord in Abraham’s spirit, as written in Genesis 12: 1-3, were quite strong and emphatic, “Leave your country, your people and you father’s household and go to the land I will show you.  I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you.  I will make your name great and you will be a blessing.  I will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you, I will course; and all the peoples of the earth will be blessed through you.”<br> <br>It did not take Abraham a long time to decide and be convinced. He was not totally unfamiliar with the ways of the Lord.  His forebears, who were descendants of Shem, the son of Noah, who survived the destructive flood the destroyed the whole earth- had taught and inspired Abraham to honor and respect the wisdom of the Lord. He did not ask God for a detailed explanation of the plans that were unfolding before his eyes.  He did not also find any need to set any pre-conditions or demands from the Lord. He simply took God’s word and set forth in a journey that would forever change the course of his life and the course of human history. He took his wife Sarah, his nephew Lot who was like a son to him, all his servants and all his possessions with him in his journey.<br>   <br>Reflecting on this action of Abraham, the writer of Hebrews 11 points out that what enabled and empowered Abraham to move with such confidence and spiritual precision during a very crucial and defining moment in his life was his faith.  Hebrews 11:8 reads,  “By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going…”   We learn from the experience of Abraham, that faith, in all its complexity, intricacy and profundity simply means  obedience.  And obedience, in all its expressions, variations and forms, only calls for two things:  letting go and letting God. <br> <br>Every so often in our lives, as decided and determined by the wisdom God, we come face to face with a similar experience as that which was experienced by Abraham. God pays us an unexpected visit.  He calls us out of our comfort zones.  He opens our hearts to dreams and visions we never imagined were possible. Finally, he comes closer to us and without any form of coercion, manipulation or force the Lord pops the question that will change us for the rest of our lives.  He asks, “Are you in or are you out?”  As you all know, many, if not most of us pastors, did not intentionally plan on becoming ministers.  Most pastors have set their lives to pursue different careers.  <br><br>After finishing my studies in St. Paul College of Nursing in 1991 , passing the board exams and working as a nurse at Makati Medical Center, my plan was to pursue higher education and establish a career in developmental research, training and instruction.  When I informed my nursing supervisor about the call of Lord for me to serve in the church, I had to be asked many times over if I was totally sure of what I was about to do.  When my professors and classmates in St. Paul found out about my plans, they were greatly concerned. I was the president of our class and an 18th board placer.  So many people had such great hopes for my nursing career.   When I broke the news to my family that I had accepted the invitation of the Church Council through late Dr. Cirilo A. Rigos,  to work in the church, my father did not speak to me for days. I could now speak about that part of my life with so much joy and even humor because in hindsight, I know that my Papa’s reaction was not out of anger or contempt, but out of understandable shock and fatherly concern for the future of his eldest child.  Many things have changed since then. For one, my Papa now smiles with pride when asked what I do for a living!<br><br>All of us have your own stories to share and journeys to reflect on. We have all experienced being interrupted by the Lord in the pursuit of that we thought was the good for us only to find out that there is a better and best plan each and every time.  Like Abraham, we are sometimes called to pursue what is unfamiliar, untried and unknown.<br><br>  Certainly, it can be the most frightening and intimidating thing in the world, but praise God that by faith in the Lord, it can also be the best thing that can ever happen to us.  Trust and obey.  As our favorite hymn go, there is no other way to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.   <br><br> “Heavenly Father , like Abraham, open the eyes of our hearts that we may look forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. Whenever you call us to new  places we do not fully know, or do new things we have not even tried, teach us to let go and let God. O God of Abraham, remove our every fear and panic especially when our lives are disrupted and when our all our sincere plans suddenly fall apart.    Remind us that just like Abraham, that there is always a bigger and higher purpose for our lives and for our existence.  Grant us favor O Lord, that our acts of obedience do not become self-serving, but may result to the redemption and salvation of others who will be blessed and benefited by our faith in you.”  <br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

In the USA, stringent laws with heavy penalties for violators regulate the amount of oil in the ground water. <br><br>In the state of New Jersey, for example, the ground water of a site must be tested for the presence of oil, gasoline, kerosene, etc. before any structure is given a building permit. If the ground water tests positive, the law requires that the water must be free of oil contaminants before a permit is issued. <br><br>And the law is always enforced! I know this because my son, an environmental geologist, heads a technical company that performs the required tests for the leakage of oil from oil depots, such as gasoline and diesel fuel filling stations. What his company does in the state of New Jersey is test the ground water in the vicinity of oil depots for the presence, as well as the amount of oil contaminants in the water. <br><br>I think the Philippines should likewise follow the requirement of developed nations especially with regard to the quality of water consumed by the people. The DENR should be the lead agency of the national government to implement such laws. <br><br>Under our system of government, the local government units are equally tasked to provide safeguards for water supplies, whether they are used for direct human consumption or they are reserved for other purposes.  <br><br>I am told that the regional DENR office in Cebu City and two officials of the government of Dumaguete City issued  permits for the construction of a gasoline station in Tubod, Dumaguete.  <br><br>Tubod, as every long-time  Dumaguete resident knows, is the site of a ntural spring, which is the source of water for the residents. <br><br>Unfortunately, the Tubod spring area has been developed. The spring itself  is no longer prominent, and the area has become more prone to flooding, which is the natural way of spreading various kinds of pollutants. (Flooding of this part of Dumaguete is by itself a problem waiting to be addressed by the City government.)  <br><br>About 28 residents led by Prof. Jocelyn Somoza-de la Cruz signed a letter-petition addressed to Cenro Mario Aragon dated May 31, 2010, objecting to the construction of the gasoline station on the ground of possible pollution of the spring water. <br><br>The petition asked for an environmental impact study and consultations with the Tubod residents. Impact studies are needed these days when we are facing environmental onlaughts from changes in climate patterns that are already evident. <br><br>Apparently, this letter-petition has been ignored by the concerned authorities.<br><br>The argument that the gasoline station should be constructed because it will bring about progress in Dumaguete is rendered untenable because of the risk of pollution of the water source. The health and well being of people should be given a higher priority under a sound governance system. <br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Years after whistleblowers denounced   error-studded textbooks, kids are still handcuffed to them. <br><br>In  1997, German national Helmut Haas, who teaches English to foreign students in Cebu, denounced  the flawed texts. That led to a congressional inquiry. Thirteen years later, Haas complained over failure to correct the errors. <br><br>Haas  discovered  multiple  errors in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Joyful  Expressions</span>, his son’s Grade 6 Music, Arts and Physical Education book, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sun Star</span> reported. “By law, writers of this book should be taken out and hung for the cold-blooded murder of the English tongue.” <br><br>“Blatant twaddle” was how he described some errors. Here’s an example: “Astronomers used their naked eyes to observe heavenly bodies.” His son’s MAPE book provides this instruction: “Dribble the ball while walking with one hand in different directions.” <br><br>In  Manila,  Antonio Calipjo Go, who battled single-handedly the  lucrative trade of flawed books for almost 15 years earlier, skewered the   <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">English for You and Me: Reading Text for Grade Three</span>. Here are some bloppers  he found: <br><br>On page 11: “Let the pupils do the action as what they think the characters will do.” Page 14: “The walls of the pupa case break. What do you think comes out from it? A baby butterfly comes out.” The caterpillar will be a baby moth. Page 25: “Ants have long hairs on their front legs. They use their hair like a brush.” <br><br>Years later, Go found – like Haas – glaring errors in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Biology</span>. This is  used in the subject Science and Technology by 2nd year high school students of public schools. The first edition, published in 1990, and reprinted editions were “developed” by the National Institute for Science & Mathematics Education Development, an extension arm of UP. <br><br>It has been in use for 20 years – and  hasn’t be updated. It cites UN data on world population in year 2000 at 6.4 billion, for instance. The world’s population now stands at 6.822 billion. Thus, the difference is a staggering 442 million. <br><br>The book contains many factual errors. Page 328: “Two endemic orchid species, kapa- kapa <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(Medinilla magnifica)</span> and waling-waling<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> (Vanda sanderiana)</span> are endangered.” Even unschooled plant gatherers from Mt. Banahaw know that <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">medinillas</span>, by their very form and structure, are not orchids but shrubs,” Go points out. <br><br>The errors go on and on, from anteaters of Australia to octopuses. “An octopus uses its tentacles to capture prey and bites it with its jaws.” <br><br>“The real tragedy is not that the book has been overstaying or that it contains many errors,” Go points out.  “But  two windows of opportunity had, in fact, been opened to the possibility of this book being replaced, after 20 years, by a better one. Those prospects had apparently and sadly been allowed to fritter away”. <br><br>He noted that the Education Department’s approved contract for this textbook was P226 million. Two years later, another P531 million was allocated for this obsolete book. <br><br>In  2008, DepEd spet P1.77 billion for books. For all that, no new textbook in High School Science & Technology from first to fourth year had been published, printed, and delivered. What we see are new reprints of old textbooks. <br><br>“Where did all the money go?,” Go asked. “ Shouldn’t it have been harnessed for the purpose for which it was conceived -- the procurement of textbooks that do not miseducate, that do not idiotize…. <br><br>“There is no greater lie than a textbook which teaches errors in lieu of lessons. No official fiat can make the errors vanish into thin air. There must be real, honest-to-goodness textbook reform.” <br><br>“Books are the carriers of civilization,” historian Barbara Tuchman insisted. “Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science crippled, thought and speculation silenced,” said this author of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Guns of August</span>. Indeed, the true university these days is a collection of books. <br><br>The  dangers  that Haas and Go document so lucidly  resemble the threat that angers that stem from subsidized falsification of history textbooks for public school students, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Inquirer</span> noted earlier <br><br>Joel Sarmenta and Melvin Yabut of the University of Asia & the Pacific, for example, documented how some textbooks paper over militarization of Philippine society and massive human rights violation under martial law. They presented their paper before the Ateneo-Wisconsin Universities conference on Memory, Truth Telling and the Pursuit of Justice.<br> <br>These books, funded by taxpayers, denigrate dissidents. Massive corruption is ignored. They regurgitate the dictatorship’s claim that martial law was “the only way to save democracy.” <br><br>“It should not surprise us to see that young people today are so apathetic about the struggle for democracy, historian Ambeth Ocampo has written. “Martial law text books continue to miseducate.” <br><br>President Benigno Aquino III has proposed <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ten Ways to Fix Philippine Basic Education</span>. “Poor quality textbooks have no place in our schools,” P-Noy said. “I will not tolerate poor textbook quality in our schools. Textbooks will be judged by three criteria: quality, better quality, and more quality.” <br><br>That is a welcome policy direction. Today’s sloppy grade school textbooks exact an inordinate   cost to our children’s future is extortionate, as Haas and Go point out.  And we’re  painfully  learning the truth of what Ralph Waldo Emerson stressed: “Books are the best of things, well used; abused, the worst.”<br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Unfortunately, the story is not all happy. <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Frederick S.

It’s on the Campus of Silliman University, and was probably designed and built shortly after the end of  the Second World War, when Silliman was mostly run by Americans. <br><br>It looks like the staircase in a public building in a small American town in a state like Ohio or Indiana. These could be the stairs in the Post Office in Muncie Indiana, or the town hall in Athens Ohio, or the railroad station in some other town along the way. <br><br>The design is a perfect reproduction, from the wide wooden stairs and plain railings to the narrow plank walls. Even the dark brown and pale yellow colors are authentic. If this woman ever winds up in one of those American towns, she’ll feel right at home, at least with the staircase. <br><br>On the other hand, the motorcycle she’s going toward is the common transportation in Asia, not America.  It’s a Japanese design, probably made in China, and there’s nothing American about it.  It’s much too small and too slow for American roads. When they changed from horses and carriages to automobiles a century ago, Americans reinvented America’s whole way of life -- for higher speed and greater distance. <br><br>But when people in Southeast Asia changed from grass to gasoline, they just replaced their horses with motorcycles, their carriages with pedicabs, and kept their speeds and distances about the same. They also kept the local social structure unchanged: In American towns in 1910, automobiles were only for the wealthy, while ordinary people were horse-driven. In Dumaguete, that’s still true today, although the horses have  become motorcycles.<br><br>Many intellectuals in Dumaguete, like their counterparts in other cities here, are constantly searching for a True Filipino Culture. To this end they have invented largely imaginary Pre-Hispanic tribal costumes, music and dances which are dutifully performed at schools and universities and featured in textbooks, with little effect on the cell phone and facebook generation they’re trying to reach. <br><br>But the true Filipino Culture is right there in front of them, as in this picture: A  tri-lingual English-speaking woman in Dumaguete descending an American staircase toward a Japanese motorcycle made in China. This picture, this situation, is uniquely Filipino. It could not be seen anywhere else in the world. <br><br><img src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport8-15-10.jpg\" align=\"LEFT\"\" border=\"0\"><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Educational institutions with quality academic programs usually prescribe strict performance standards that athletes must meet to play and satisfy the academic requirements. <br><br>Recruitment of athletes for school sports is a controversial practice which, in the case of the United States for example, merited the intervention of the US Congress because of abuses committed by member institutions of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, an intercollegiate sports league that early Filipino sports directors and founding members from UP, UST, FEU, and NU, ever manifesting the Filipino trait of proverbial copycats, have adopted back in 1924. <br><br>Perusing the internet, I noted several laws passed by the US Congress which prescribe regulations on the recruitment of athletes. The most recent of these are the Uniform Athlete Agent Act of 2000, and the Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act of 2004. Both laws define the procedure which recruiting agents must observe when dealing with potential athletes to enroll in college institutions. <br><br>Still more recently, the American NCAA, after a four-year investigation on recruiting violations, imposed the following sanctions on perennial collegiate athletic power University of Southern California: “The USC football team cannot participate in Bowl Games for the year 2010 and 2011 seasons which will cost the Trojans millions of dollars…and it will lose 10 scholarships and severe recruiting restrictions.” <br><br>In the Metro Manila NCAA, the recruitment of foreign athletes to beef up local teams had been questioned as it unduly paces smaller and less- financially-endowed schools in a disadvantaged position. <br><br>Foreign players from Southeast Asian countries, Asia, Australia, Africa and the USA were paraded in the opening of current 86th NCAA basketball competitions. While some schools justify the use of foreign players who come to the Philippines for cheaper quality education, others complain that their athletic budget cannot support the cost of subsiding the studies of recruited foreign athletes. <br><br>Just how much does an institution subsidize the studies of varsity players recruited to represent it in athletic leagues? The following figures are estimates from the cost of tuition and other expenses that FU provides for its athletes this academic year: a) tuition for grade school football – P372,086, b) tuition for high school football– P359,944, c) tuition for college varsity football men & women, volleyball men & women, basketball men, athletics, sepak takraw – P934,200,   d)  lunch at cafeteria for 10 months – 920,000,  e) Saturday post- run breakfast for 10 months – P72,000, f) uniforms – P50,000, g) kettlebells strength training – P211,806, h) Unigames fees – P43,000. These adds up to P2,963,036. <br><br>The above total does not include the cost of participation in local and out-of-town competitions, and taking part in the PRISAA which is a requirement for all institutions collecting the PRISAA fee. Sports Director Paultom Paras tells me that the FU annual sports budget is about P3.5 million. <br><br>When we recruit athletes, we emphasize to them that playing and winning championships is secondary to their studies, and the quest for a college degree. All athletes who fail the prelims, mid-terms or final examinations immediately lose their scholarship. <br><br>We provide tutorial services for athletes needing help in passing their subjects. We team up with parents, guidance counselors, and secure the support of college deans and instructors. We regularly monitor their health and fitness. And as seen above, we provide them one free meal a day taken either as breakfast or as lunch. <br><br>At FU, we judge the success of our varsity program not on the number of championships won by our athletes in league competitions but on the number of athletes who, at graduation time, march across the stage to receive their diplomas. <br><br>This piece about collegiate varsity sports budgets reminds me of the time the late Jose Ravello, then director of the SU Athletics, and my coach in the Third Asian Games in Tokyo, visited me at the UP Institute of Sports, Physical Education & Recreation. I asked him how much was his sports budget. “My God, Coach, that’s my budget for one month!” I exclaimed when he revealed to me his program budget. <br><br>After his visit, I recommended to my President OD Corpuz that we abrogate the annual UP-Silliman Dual Meet. There was no way SU could be competitive with UP which, at that time, was the over-all UAAP back-to-back general champion. <br><br>Speaking of SU, here’s a happy note that I hope the local SU community will consider emulating.The Silliman University Cebu Alumni will stage the Silliman Run 2010 this Aug. 22, 2010 at the Terraces in Ayala Center-Cebu. There will be three race categories: 3K, 5K and 10K. This will be a fund-raising activity. The registration fee is P250. There will be a P50.00 price cut on the registration fee for those who register early. On- site registrants will pay an additional P50.00 registration fee. The SU alums in Cebu are in tune with the current running boom. <br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "The Philippine Opera Company brings its re- staging of the Tony Award- winning show Master Class to the Claire Isabel McGill Luce Auditorium in Sillliman University, Dumaguete City, after a successful Manila run. The play, starring Cherie Gil as the legendary opera diva Maria Callas, is set to have its Visayan premiere on 20 August 2010, and will have a repeat on August 21. {{more}}<BR><BR>Master Class, written by Terrence McNally and directed locally by Michael Williams of Miss Saigon fame, was first produced by the Philadelphia Theatre Company in March 1995. It opened at the Golden Theatre in New York City in November that same year. It is based on a series of master classes given by the renowned opera singer Maria Callas at the Juilliard School of Music in New York in 1971 and 1972. <BR><BR>Callas was the greatest dramatic soprano of her generation and also a controversial figure. Her restless and tempestuous personality often led her into disputes with opera managements and feuds with rival singers. However, she was adored by her fans and was the subject of constant media attention, including gossip about her jet-set life with the wealthy Greek ship owner Aristotle Onassis. <BR><BR>Although Master Class does delve into the triumphs and tragedies of Callas’ life, its primary focus is the art of dramatic singing. As McNally’s fictional version of Callas teaches her class, she explains to her students—two sopranos and a tenor—just what it takes to invest the music with real feeling, revealing as she does so how demanding the profession of opera singing is. She also reveals her own contradictory personality—proud and egotistical yet also vulnerable and self-pitying. <BR><BR>In spite of all the flaws of its main character, however, Master Class, written by a man who has been a Callas fan since he was a teenager in high school, is a tribute to the dedication of a great singer and actress to her chosen art. <BR><BR>The play features television, film, and stage actress Cherie Gil, in a very rare performance as the opera icon Maria Callas. Gil as Callas was cited twice as Best Actress in Philippine Daily Inquirer’s Best of Theater in 2008. The Philippine Star’s Rosalinda Orosa also wrote: “Master Class captured the fiery, explosive temperament and passion for perfection—traits which Cherie Gil magnificently conveyed.” <BR><BR>For inquiries, please call (035) 422-6002 loc. 520 or loc. 250, or 09173235953.

Descuatan with Victor Vicente ‘Dean’ G. Sinco, chairman of Foundation University. </span><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;\">GTD: Reliable information has reached us that there is a challenge to the leadership of Foundation University and this group claims that they are legally correct and that they are the majority. I understand there was a meeting on July 7 where there was an attempt to question your leadership. We heard that you are an overstaying chair and that there is an attempt by your side of the family to continue the leadership here at Foundation University even if there already is a serious challenge to your leadership. So tell us,  Dean, what is happening here at Foundation University? </span><br>VVGS: At the July 7 meeting, there really wasn’t anything presented challenging my position. What was presented on July 7 was the need to  examine   the terms of certain trustees.  At that time we didn’t have information so we called for a recess. Everyone agreed, including the lawyers who represented the family members. So we scheduled the next meeting for July 29 but two or three days before that, we sent a letter that we wanted to postpone it because we were in the midst of accreditation. Based on what happened on those 3 days of accreditation, it was looking very, very positive and we wanted to focus on that and not be distracted by other things. Now, the other members claimed that they never got to see the notice. We have affidavits stipulating that one of the members opened the letter, called his lawyer, and his lawyer told him not to receive it and give the letter back to us. Okay, so basically he received it. In our eyes they were informed. We weren’t on campus because we were busy addressing the accreditors. So what I heard is they attempted to come in at first. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: were they prevented from coming in? </span><br>DGS: Yes, because the two lawyers that came in on the 7th brought in armed guards. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: Armed? Were they publicly displaying their firearms? </span><br>DGS: There was a bulge and one of our security forces saw the butt of a gun when the bodyguard shifted. So, CHED has a policy [against the bringing of guns in campus] and we were just following security for our students and our employees to not allow the bodyguards in. <br>So on July 7th there was a little bit of exchange in the front. The lawyers insisted that the bodyguards accompany them into the board room and I said, “no way” because that’s just against the policy and CHED regulations. So, that was settled and the guards stayed outside on the July 7th meeting. On the 29th, they appeared again, this time, with four guards, but they were a little bit more careful…the guards stood across the street. But they were not supposed to be here because the meeting was cancelled, so as far as I know, they held their own meeting. <br><br> <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: Foundation University is a family corporation, is that correct? </span><br> VVGS: Well, not necessarily. It’s composed of family members but first and foremost it’s a non-stock, non-profit. We’ve had non-family members in the corporation before. It is predominantly family but it isn’t a family corporation. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD:  The stock holders now are all family members? You don’t have an outsider? </span><br>VVGS: Presently, we have six outsiders. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: What exactly is the conflict all about? I know that in corporations, there are always challenges to the leadership and as the public sees Foundation now, it seems to be doing really very well. Is this the first that there is an attempt like this by the other members of the board and stockholders? </span><br>DGS: No, not really. This is not the first. You know, when it’s time to plant the rice, there are very few volunteers. When it’s time to harvest, everybody wants to come and harvest. And that’s in essence the problem we have. <br>My grandfather started this school in 1949 that would basically bring equality to all. Today--61 years later—we feel that that dream has been achieved. We are there! <br>And that is why the accreditation was very important to us. We had to pay attention to the accreditors because we were getting a feeling that we would get a confirmation from them. Basically, on exit interview, they confirmed that there are many things that this institution provides the students that don’t even exist in some of the prestigious institutions in Manila. And most of these accreditors were mostly from Manila—two from CEU.  So we were really quite happy we heard that. <br>Going back to history, my father was involved from day 1 of the institution and we stayed until 1968. You can look back in history the way education was before—it wasn’t high tech. We had classrooms, we had books, we had teachers, and I feel that we were doing okay. We were not yet at that time a premiere institution. We could not even consider ourselves a premiere institution but we had good quality education. We left in 1968 and basically, my father was absent between 1968 and 1995. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: For the reason that… </span><br>VVGS: More family problems… <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: So the family problem actually started way back then… </span><br>VVGS: It’s been going on for a long time. So anyway, between ’68 and ’95, I just have to say one thing--what happened? <br>Before 1995, I was living in Hawaii and my parents were living in Washington. My father was still working for the University of Washington and he would still attend the annual meetings for the corporations here. My mom told me of several telephone calls in 1994 or 1993 that really upset my father. He had read the financials and basically it read that the family corporations — including Foundation University--was bankrupt. So from 1968 to 1993, 94, 95…what happened? <br>I know the family doesn’t want to hear this, but in 1994, 1995, the family members decided to liquidate because it was that far gone and there wasn’t anyone interested in working to bring back the assets to where they should have been. So my father elected to take early retirement from the University of Washington. They all agreed that he would come and work on the school, spend a little bit and bring it up to speed, which is what he did. <br>In 1995, when he finally was able to stabilize the finances, he had asked me…I was in Hawaii I had my own office…he had asked me to… <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: To take over? </span><br>VVGS: No, no, no. See, that’s the thing. Everyone thinks that we always had it in mind that we will return and take over. That’s not so. I had my own firm in Hawaii. I had started in Hawaii in 1980. And by 91, I had my own firm. And by the time my father asked me to help out, he said, “just come over here, once or twice and year and design something for me.” And that’s what I did. The first project is the library over here. It was a really small project—it’s two gates--I designed two gates. (laughs). <br>He just wanted things to look better so that whoever was interested in purchasing the property would feel that the value was there. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: And he didn’t have to pay you to do that? </span><br>VVGS: No, just the plane ticket and a couple of weeks of my time and that was it. I was self employed and I was basically able to do that. <br>My second project is the social garden, that used to be the volleyball courts. And so one project led to another. And none of this had anything to do with me coming back because my wife is Japanese-American, my kids are all American, we lived in Hawaii all these years, basically that’s our life. <br>And so I just went back and forth just to help—just design this, design that, but never had any idea of coming back—never. In ’98, it was me that came up with the idea because I could see the difference. <br>We left in 68. I came back in 75 and I was wondering, “what’s happening here?” And my grandfather died in 1988 and I came back in 88 and I asked, “what is really happening here? There’s something wrong.” <br>When then when I came back in 95, I just couldn’t believe the state of the school. You could say I got the bug. I wanted to be part of the institution, and not because life is better here or anything like that. There’s definitely  a big sacrifice that we made. I had a talk with my wife and it took us one year to decide to transfer here. I closed up my office which was doing really well. I had eight employees. I can tell you now, I’m not bragging but I was earning ten thousand dollars a month and I went from ten thousand to five hundred a month. That’s insanity to do something like that (laughs). <br>But the mission was here. I felt that my presence here was more important than my presence in Hawaii. So we all agreed and came out here and we supported my father.  So from 95 until now, there were basically three people. First was my father, then there was me, then there’s my mother. And what we like to present is, “you judge for yourself--15 years from today up to 1995—what has happened in this place? And you judge for yourself what has happened between 95 and 68. And you can judge for yourself what happened between 68 and 49. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: So why can’t they appreciate that? We heard that you actually, with premeditation that your family, your mother, yourself, probably even your father, had orchestrated so that eventually you will be on top of the school? </span><br>VVGS: Well, (laughs), you have to ask them that question because I never get a straight answer. You can construe just about anything you want from certain situations but I never get a straight answer as to why these issues keep cropping up. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: Are they planning to sell this? </span><br>VVGS: No, it’s impossible to sell it because it is stipulated in the by-laws that if it is sold, the proceeds go to a scholarship. So you can’t take from it as an individual as you would with a stock corporation. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: Are you and your mom making money here in this school? </span><br>VVGS: We’re earning salaries that are comparable to other institutions in the country. But I don’t have any assets here in the country, I do not own a home in Hawaii. I’m renting. I don’t make enough money to even think about buying a home in Hawaii. I’m comfortable. But am I making hand over fist? I wish. (laughs). <br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: So how do you look at all these Dean? Do you consider this a serious threat? </span><br>VVGS: I can answer that in several ways. As an architect, you have good clients, you have bad clients.  You can’t pick them. You try as best as you can but when you end up with the bad clients, you don’t just walk away. You can’t. You have to finish the project. And in the end, it’s always the hope that you turn this bad client by having him appreciate what you’ve done for him. It’s the same philosophy here. You just have an environment that at times is not totally conducive to work. But on the other side of the token, we have graduation every year and we are constantly reminded as to why this institution must remain viable.  That was the fervent wish of the founder and I see it happen year after year. And so for me, that pretty much alleviates the frustrations every year because I may not be making money but people are happy! <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: There’s this group that is looking at the legal side and they have their battery of lawyers. How are you answering that? </span><br>VVGS: We have our own battery of lawyers also and we’ve pretty much come up with a strong defense. We’re confident. We have examined the by-laws, we have examined the corporate laws and we feel that we’re covered. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: You’re saying that when the postponed meeting was postponed, it was not deliberate? That it wasn’t a ploy by Dean to avoid answering questions that the other trustees would like to throw to you during the meeting? </span><br>VVGS: No, actually not. There are some things that forced us to look again, like  the question about the terms of certain trustees. It has helped us in administering the institution because even though this is not a family corporation this was run like a family corporation and I have to say that on the legal side it has created a lot of problems. To answer your question, it wasn’t concocted. We were applying for level three five years ago. And because of one simple mistake that we committed, here we are five years later!  And it’s frustrating for me because level three is semi- autonomous. That means as an institution, we can come up with our own programs without being handcuffed by government agencies. We have so many ideas we have so many ways to service our clientele. But without that level three, we can’t do it. We have to go through a process and everybody knows that that process is so drawn out. So this is very very important to the institution. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: So how would you want this issue to end? </span><br>VVGS: I believe that the mission of the founder, my grandfather, was that this eventually is to be an institution that will be guided by its own constituents. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s always family. I believe that family should maybe at some sort of administrative level, either as a corporate member or as a trustee. I have no ambitions for my children or my wife to take over if I die. If any of my children want to do something else, I’m fine with that. We are on a path to professionalize the administration. It’s in our by-laws that the administration doesn’t require a family member. That was already put together by my grandfather. He already had the vision that it doesn’t have to be a family member to see that this institution succeeds. And that’s the direction I want to go in. If I go out and none of my children or even my brother’s children take over, I’d be happy with a professional academician that for as long as the school sticks to its mission. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: so, the information that they have the numbers, meaning they’re more than  the numbers that you have--is that relevant? </span><br>VVGS:  that depends on the math that you use. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: The other side will probably have a different story to tell. How is this problem going to affect you as the person who’s at the helm of this university? </span><br>VVGS: well, it’s always in my mind everyday. But, you know, we need to get on with life. And there are bigger fish to fry. I’m not trying to make light of other people’s situations.  We’ve achieved in the last fifteen years what the founder had wished many years ago, but we have a long way to go. <br>You know, our biggest challenge right now is because our funds come from tuition fees.  We want to do more but who’s going to pay for it? How are we going to pay for it? These are some of the things I’m working on daily to resolve. Everyone thinks that the school has moved quickly but for me, I think 15 years is too slow. I wanted to achieve this, let’s say, half the time. But I’m still impatient. I want it to move faster. And so, we need to focus on the things that will help the institution and eventually help our students, help the community, help the country. That’s our mission. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: so, what is the philosophy of financial management that you have? I know that Foundation University’s one of the schools that do not increase tuition as much as you would want. And, in comparison with the other private schools, basically, your tuition is a lot lower. So, how do you address the increasing needs for resources, and payments of teachers and so on? </span><br>VVGS: well, on the increase of resources, this is why the accreditation was also very important because it put us on the map. It made us viable for philanthropists who have the funds and who want to support the program.  Now we can show them, “look, we’ve got it! You can trust us. You give us one million, two million, whatever… you’ll get results.”  <br>As far as everything else, just ask yourself, “how does a poor man manage from day to day?” You just have to do what you can do. And sometimes, you just have to ask people to trust you. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: Can you still call for a board meeting for them to come? </span><br>VVGS: well, actually, there are two meetings. We have the membership-slash-corporation meeting and then we have the board of trustee meetings. We just concluded the Board of Trustees meeting this morning because it is the third quarter, and we hold meetings every quarter. And the continuation of the membership meeting requires, I believe, 10 days. But I’m already departing, so we’ll probably continue in September when I return. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: Are you going out of the country, Dean? </span><br>VVGS: (nods) That’s another thing that people don’t know. I’m not always here. See, what happened six years after we moved here, my wife’s family also needed some attention. My father-in-law suffers from Dementia and my mother-in-law is getting old. So my wife felt that it was her duty to be there and take care of them. So, again, we transplanted the family, after bringing them here, we’re bringing them back to Hawaii. Now, because of my commitment here to the institution, I couldn’t just say, “Sayonara.” So, a compromise is I commute back and forth. So I spend four weeks there, four weeks here. And this is my fifth year in doing this. And, you know, for those people who say, “wow, you must be really rich to travel”-- it isn’t that. My salary here in Foundation covers my plane fare. The school doesn’t pay for my plane fare, this is out of my own pocket. And for the expenses in the U.S., my wife works, and my income supplements her income. Not her income supplements my income – I supplement hers. So, I’m an add-on. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: But you’re happy here, Dean?  Are you happy with what you’re doing? </span><br>VVGS: As much as frustrations can crop up from time to time, I’m happy and most importantly, my family is happy. Without their support, I really would have been gone a long time ago. And they also understand the mission. It’s vital. It really has to be attended to. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: What else would you want to do, finally, here at Foundation University that you haven’t done yet? I mean, in relation, your understanding of the original mission of your grandfather?</span> <br>VVGS: I have this really wild dream to open up a 20-hectare campus in Valencia. But I know it’s takes billions of pesos to do that. But I think I could maybe achieve a small piece of that before I go because we’ve done so many things here. If you asked my father in 1999 if you could put 15 to 20 million for the gym extension, he would say, “Forget it!”  As the saying goes, “How do you eat an elephant?” Just take a bite at a time. That’s all we did. I think Valencia is doable. All I have to do is take many bites at a time. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: Have you taken some bites already?</span> <br>VVGS: Yeah, yeah, tastes bad. (laughs) <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">GTD: What message you would like to tell to the family of Foundation University students and families? </span><br>VVGS: Well, we owe it to the community. Since day one of the institution, we’ve had many generations of families sending their grandchildren, their cousins, their nephews to this institution. So we owe it to them to keep this place running because there is that level of trust. How you achieve that level of trust, I have to thank my father and my grandfather because they  probably went through the same frustrations I’m going through. It takes a lot of dedication and we are dedicated to the community. We will be here through thick or thin, we will be here to serve your generation and subsequent generation. That is our mission. We will be here and we will provide you the best that we can at that moment. <br><br><br> <br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Not everyone, however, does. {{more}}<BR><BR>But if the concept of putting money to work is enough to give a person a big headache, there are simpler concepts that may be studied. One such concept is not to spend money before it is earned. <BR><BR>Just last week, we were able to catch a glimpse of how some of our elected public officials in Dumaguete view money. Mayor Manuel Sagarbarria asked for money from the City Council to buy two reconditioned heavy equipment — a bulldozer and a backhoe — for the purpose of rechanelling the Banica River in preparation for the rains. The need is immediate, considering that the rainy season has already arrived. <BR><BR>The Council initially thumbed down the Mayor’s request. Most of those who voted against the measure said they did not want the City to buy reconditioned units but they wanted brand new ones. In the absence of brand new units, they suggested that the City instead content itself with renting its equipment. <BR><BR>This reasoning may have gotten them some pogi points with voters but this clearly wasn’t carefully thought about. First of all, there is no money available to buy brand new units. Secondly, the cost of renting heavy equipment for several months would be equivalent or more than the price of the said equipment. <BR><BR>The choices are actually simple. For as long everyone is agreed on the need to buy the heavy equipment, there should be no debate on what type of equipment to buy. Unless, of course, there are other reasons that are better left unsaid. <BR><BR>Finally, the Councilors came up with a common position on this matter and decided to support the Mayor’s request to buy the reconditioned equipment. We laud them for their cooperation. Surely, when the next flood comes around, all the survivors (i.e., those who stand to benefit from the purchase of this heavy equipment) will remember to vote for you again. <BR><BR>",

Mining has money. So, in a debate, guess who wins?” Oposa, a 2009 Ramon Magasaysay Awardee, said.<BR><BR>Oposa was in Dumaguete for an assessment on the Protected Area Management Effectiveness at Silliman University, organized by the Dr. Jovito Salonga Center for Law and Development and the German Development Service.<BR><BR>Oposa said the DENR has a highly difficult task to fulfill the mandate in their laws. “Show me a mining company that has been closed down because of pollution without causing an uproar – none, because mining has money,” he said.<BR><BR>He said the plan to abolish the DENR and come up with two separate agencies each for conservation and mineral utilization, was conceived  before the elections and he is pursuing this move with friends in congress. In its place, the plan is to put up the National Environmental Protection Agency as a separate office from the Department of Natural Resources which will deal with the utilization of the natural resources.<BR><BR>He said the concern over the protection of the Philippines’ natural resources is urgent because the Philippines has among the richest terrestrial ecosystems in the world.  “Pound for pound, hectare for hectare, the Philippines is the richest land on Earth, but the budget for protected areas is only P70 million—only 70 percent of one percent of the national budget,” Oposa said.<BR><BR> The idea of fusing the offices of the Environment and Natural Resources was a good idea in the beginning, Oposa admitted, but in the end, “you cannot have a person who is thrifty and at the same time is an addicted gambler. You have, in the department, people who are thrifty for conservation, yet you have the thrust of  the same department where people who are gambling irreparably and irreversibly on the natural wealth of the country. You cannot have that. You will have Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde,” he said.<BR><BR>Oposa said he has talked with some senators about this idea. I have talked to Sen. Migz Zubiri and I support that bill that has been filed in the Senate. He said he has not yet heard of a similar bill filed in the House of Representatives.<BR><BR><BR>",

But the test case, he said is the case filed in 2008 against a Bukidnon farmer who shot and killed a three-year-old juvenile male Philippine Eagle, an endangered species and one of the world’s largest and rarest eagles. <br><br>The farmer, Brian Balaon, is facing charges punishable by up to 12 years in jail and P1 million in fines. <br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Early last year, the District and the city of Dumaguete pooled their resources amounting to P25 million to construct the said facility. “It is a rare partnership”, GM Dicen said, pertaining to the joint undertaking. <BR><BR>Also highlighting the anniversary celebration is the inauguration of the DCWD water testing laboratory. Mindful of its responsibility of providing safe and quality water to the concessionaires, the District embarked on establishing its own water testing laboratory which is capable of bacteriological, chemical and physical analysis of drinking water. <BR><BR>Various activities were already held starting early August for the purpose of creating awareness and involving the public sector in the celebration. These include the invitational sportsfest (basketball, volleyball, chess, billiards and tennis), inter-HS poster making and exhibit, free concert at Robinson’s Place, Thanksgiving Mass and tree planting activity at Lunga, Valencia, Negros Oriental. <BR><BR>Today the District serves close to 22,000 concessionaires in the city ranging from residential, commercial, government and educational institutions.

This was naturally very disturbing as we haven’t heard of his wife having passed on to the hereafter recently. Mind you, we were not just two nosy ladies putting one and one together and coming up with eleven.  That sweet young thing with her nubile body kept resting her head on his shoulders. Now tell me, what were we supposed to think about that?  Of course, they could be father and daughter bonding together. But at past 11pm in the company of drinking buddies? Right! <br><br>It was none of our business of course.  But I am making mention of that incident because it led up to this topic and my admission that what I saw is forcing me to confront my own insecurities as a wife and has left me obsessing on thoughts of marriage and infidelity. <br><br>These “demons” – as I call them – are never far away from me. They are always present in the fringes of my mind. But I had always been able to keep them at a safe distance until this forced confrontation brought about by what I saw. <br><br>I would suppose that this is also the case with every woman of every status, age, color or creed the world over.  Any woman reading this would probably understand when I say that no matter how happy and secure our marriages or relationships are, no matter how loving and caring our husbands or partners may be, and this is very important ... no matter how young and beautiful, or sexy and desirable, or intelligent and accomplished we may be ... those demons still come from time to time to tease and taunt us, to cast a dark shadow over our lives and upset that delicate balance we call marital happiness and contentment. <br><br>These taunting could come in different forms.  It could be in the news about movie stars breaking up because of “third parties” or it could be what’s happening to people close to us – friends, relatives, or simply people we know from a distance.  But in whatever form the taunting may come, it always gives us pause and makes us contemplate our own marriage or relationship ...  because whether we are watching as a wife, a girlfriend, or a partner, and no matter how vehemently we may deny it to ourselves, deep inside, we cower in fear at the thought that what is happening to other women could also happen to us. <br><br>I am particularly vulnerable to these demons because my husband is a seaman.  Not that he has given me reason to doubt his fidelity, but we are dealing with realities here, not the ideals, and it is a fact that seamen can commit countless acts of infidelity with impunity simply because they are too far away. The normal controls do not apply to them.  The risk of getting “caught” is minimal to nil.  <br><br>Of course, not all men do it. I am certain that we can still find men who take their marital vows to heart. And seamen’s wives, as probably ALL wives do, cling to that hope ... that our husbands are among those few men. Kind of naive, that’s true, but what else is there? <br><br>As I mentioned earlier, this prickly subject has been gnawing at my equilibrium lately.  It is not only that encounter with that sweet young thing that triggered this.  Somebody I know is going through the very same thing that we all fear.  She is, like me, a seaman’s wife and she just recently discovered her husband’s infidelities and her life is falling apart right now. My heart goes out to her as I am painfully aware that, sharing parallel lives as we do, it can easily be me in her place right now. <br><br>In fairness to the male species though, I have to mention here that it is not only the men who can be unfaithful. We women are just as capable of cheating as men are on their wives. There is no question about that. It is simply a matter of letting go with our conventions and making the decision to do it.<br><br>But do all of us do it?  Of course not! My personal opinion is that there are more faithful wives than there are husbands. We take our vows more seriously than men do. But then again, this is only my opinion. <br><br>So how am I coping now?  First of all, I do not go into denial.  I am perfectly aware that my husband, by the mere fact that he is a man whether seaman or not, is as capable of cheating on his wife as the man next to him. Again, this bears repeating: we are talking of realities and generalities here. <br><br>Has he been doing it?  I have no idea and I hope and pray that he never has and never will.  <br><br>But what if he has been doing it all these years? Let me share something with you. When the question as to whether or not he had been unfaithful to me and continues to be so came up in one of our discussions, I asked him to do three things for me: please do not ever let me know, please do not bring me any form of disease, and please do not ever fall in love. <br><br>Come to think of it, don’t we all women want the same things when it comes to our marriage? We dream of a perfect husband and a perfect marriage. But if we can’t have perfection in the area of fidelity, we might as well settle for the next best thing: we ask for ignorance ...  for isn’t ignorance bliss?  <br><br>Do I trust my husband?  My heart does. My man is a good and decent person and a wonderful husband and father and I love him and I thank God for him every day.  And most of all, my heart trusts him because I completely trust his love for me. <br><br>But my mind sometimes disagrees with my heart. Why? Maybe because it sees too much of what is actually happening in many marriages around us? That’s me. I am too realistic for my own good.  So realistic in fact, that I can’t give my husband my unquestioning faith because I can’t ignore what I know about men and human nature and what happens in the real world. <br> <br>This is the reason why I am sometimes vulnerable to my demons – as they are always present, chipping ceaselessly at that wall of trust that I carefully built and is continuing to build around my marriage. <br><br>I wonder. Is it just me or is this something that I share with every woman out there? Is there a constant battle being waged within you too?  Are you also lost in the midst of this silent war that is raging between our hearts and our minds?  Have you also been told to just trust?  And like me, did you answer: “Yes, I’d like that ... to trust fully ... if only I could stop thinking!”  I would really like that. If only it were that simple. <br><br>I wonder. Is there any woman out there who can truly and honestly say that she completely trusts her husband without any shred of doubt whatsoever?  I envy her.  I wish I could be that kind of wife. <br><br>So going back to that question I asked earlier: how do I cope?  I hold on tightly to that trust and I pray and pray and pray ... <br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

In his dream, God said to him, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple of sacrifice.”</span>  At that moment, King Solomon understood more deeply the purpose of God for that sacred temple.  Verse 13 reads, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“When I shut up the heavens so that there no rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people…”  </span><br> <br>The temple of the Lord was God’s anointed place where the Israelites could cry out to God when there was no water in the land; or when their crops were being devoured by pests or when there is plague destroying the people. In other words, the Holy Place of God was God’s concrete and visual reminder of his faithfulness, his power and his eternal love for his people.   Furthermore, the Temple was God’s special  and powerful way of assuring the people that no natural calamanity, no pestilence or even no deadly plague could ever destroy the people whom God has chosen and called.  But you see, the conditions set by God for his people to experience his faithfulness, his power and his eternal love were also clearly stated. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Humble yourselves and pray</span> <br></div><br><br>        Israel as a nation during Solomon’s time, had a proud and arrogant past. As descendants of Jacob who were escaped death during a great  famine that hit the region, they were miraculously preserved by God by bringing them to Egypt during the time of Joseph. In Egypt, they enjoyed the blessings of the land, but after Joseph died, they lost favor in the eyes of the Egyptian government and were soon subjected to hard labor. But God had a mighty plan and saved them miraculously again through the leadership of Moses. But despite all these, the people often backslid and their hearts were quick to turn away from God in moments of difficulty. Their pride and arrogance often resulted in their constant grumbling, their endless complaining and their never-ending rebellion and disobedience to God.  Prayer is powerful. Every time we pray, we are able to powerfully acknowledge our utter dependence on God, confess our innermost weaknesses and yield to his grace and power- not only individually, but even as a nation. <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Seek God’s face </span><br></div><br><br>        During the Old Testament times, no one was permitted to see God’s face. Because of sinfulness, no one could ever be able to stand the intense glory and holiness of God and live. The face of God therefore, was a symbol of holiness. Therefore, seeking the face of God means desiring God’s holiness in every aspect of our lives. Many politicians have  promised to eradicate the problem of corruption in our nation. But you see, eradicating corruption entails more than just punishing corrupt officials, changing the systems in society and government and enforcing new laws in the land.  The Bible already gives us a stern warning on these powerless approaches. The Israelite’s for instance were given the 10 commandments and so many other religious and cultural laws, but all these laws failed to change them and their way of life. That’s why prophet Jeremiah prophesied the word of God who said, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“I will put my law in their <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">minds</span> and write it on their <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">hearts</span>. I will be their God and they will be my people.” (Jeremiah 31:33).</span>  Seeking the face of God therefore, is getting into the heart of our problem. It is believing that only a changed mind and changed heart can ever change our nation in the truest and deepest sense.  <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Turn from wickedness </span><br></div><br><br>        Many of us have already heard the phrase “prophetic voice.” This phrase became very popular in the Philippines especially  during the martial law years when many churches and religious groups defended the poor and the oppressed against the dictator. What we need to understand however is that genuine spirit of prophecy is more than just speaking against the ills of government or  defending  the poor and the oppressed. Genuine prophets are men and women who truly love God and people. They have genuine understanding of God’s word and God’s purposes. This is the reason why we must remain discerning.  True prophets do not only draw people away from wickedness. Real prophets lead people to the Lord and not to personal or political ideologies  and loyalties. <br>   <br>Only a nation whose God is the Lord can never be destroyed.  Let us humble ourselves and pray, let us seek God’s face and let us turn from our wicked ways; and let us believe the promise of God that he will heal from heaven, forgive our sins, and heal our land. God bless the Philippines!<br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

There she was, bundling my clothes, her pregnant belly like a balloon <br><br>“Manang Biday,” I said once, “you’re pregnant again?” <br><br> “What can I say, my husband is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">gwapo</span>,” she said.<br><br> “’Nong Fidel looks like Cachupoy on good days,” I said. <br><br> “Oh yeah,” she said, pausing for a bit, and then punctuating it all with an abundance of laughter. “What can I say? We make mistakes all the time. Better to make mistakes with so much pleasure.” <br><br>I don’t know what she meant by that. But she laughed, and so I laughed, too. I guess that’s how we exorcise the mistakes we make, with much introspection in some gesture of learning, and to end such exercise with mirth. Because what else can one do really? And life—and the maturity that eventually becomes its measure—is graded by our ability to look at ourselves and laugh. <br><br>All these are clichés, of course, but that’s how we know we are this serious about the place of laughter in our lives, especially in lives that demand it, or else we teeter on the brink of insanity. <br> <br>As author Alain De Botton recently put in a tweet: “With age, you realize certain things just can’t be fixed—and so you start to take frivolity more seriously.” <br><br>I am looking for unscripted frivolity soon, right before I turn 35. <br><br>There is the Silly People’s Improv Theater, of course, to look forward to. SPIT, as it is more known as, is the premiere improvisational theater group in the Philippines, and it is set to conquer Dumaguete today, August 15, in an unscripted comedy showcase titled “SPIT Live in Dumaguete!” This is, of course, part of the 48th cultural season of the Silliman University Cultural Affairs Committee. <br><br>What SPIT does is nothing short of amazing. They do comedy on the spot—its improvisational, after all—taking note of the most general guidelines for a comprehensible story arc, doing humor with the instinct of a drop of a hat. Whenever I see shows like this, I always think: can I do the same? make jokes out of thin air? See something or someone in the audience, and make that the material for sustained laughter. And my answer is “no.” I have the comedian’s instinct the way hippopotamuses make the most graceful ballerinas. And so to watch this laughing magicmen do their instant wonder on stage—I seethe with envy, and I go home, always, with a belly full of laughter. <br><br>SPIT was founded in 2002 by entertainer Gabe “Okay Ka Ba Tyan?” Mercado and a group of friends after Gabe trained with legendary Second City founder Paul Sills, the acknowledged Father of Modern Improv, at the Wisconsin Theater Games Center. Since then, SPIT went on to organize <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Spontaneous Combustion: The First Philippine Improv Festival</span> at the Cultural Center of the Philippines, and participated in the 3rd National Theater Festival where they premiered <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sarskwela: Ang Sarswelang Kwela</span>, a completely improvised twist on the traditional Filipino <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sarswela</span>. <br><br>In 2009, they premiered two works at the CCP, including <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Cambiar!</span>, an improvised educational environment themed show for the Earth Day Celebration, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dingdong! Death is at the Door,</span> an improvised long- form murder-mystery show for the 5th Virgin Labfest. SPIT also represented the Philippines in the prestigious Los Angeles Comedy Festival in Los Angeles in 2004. <br><br>SPIT is composed of thespians, teachers, and other professionals from varied fields, and does regular shows to packed audiences in some of the best entertainment spots throughout Manila. With close to five hundred performances to date, SPIT has delighted local and international audiences with their unscripted unrehearsed and totally spontaneous shows. <br><br>And that is what I’m looking for now. Unscripted, spontaneous comedy. The way life really works. <br><br>The show is a co-production of Little Boy Productions. Tickets are available at P200 and P300 for both the matinee and gala shows. For inquiries, please call (035) 422-6002 loc. 520 or loc. 250, or 09173235953. <br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

This girl seems to have come from a special occasion of some kind. She’s nicely dressed, and there’s an I.D. hanging down from her neck. Maybe she’s a team leader, or just a delegate. In any case, she’s young, she’s pretty, and she probably belongs to educated upper society here. Maybe that’s her family car behind her, complete with a waiting driver.<br>But she doesn’t seem happy. There’s a strange look in her eyes, a slightly haunted look, as though there were something important she failed to do, or someone she left behind in anger and now is trying to forget. And passing beside her like an unseen shadow, there is this ragged child.<br><br>It’ s a different world passing her in the night. The ragged girl certainly is not part of upper society, has no car, has come from no particular occasion, and is probably not only uneducated, but hungry. She’s very young. If she’s on the streets this late, maybe there’s trouble at home and she’s afraid to go there, or maybe she doesn’t have a home to go to; it’s not unheard of. <br><br>In any case, she is no more aware of the society girl than the society girl is of her. They’re just shadows to each other, and will be all their lives. Even if the ragged girl gets lucky and winds up as a helper or a maid to the social girl, they will never really know each other in any real sense. <br><br>Although it’s common, and often true, to hear how little the rich care for the poor -- the reverse is also true.  The poor cannot see those above them as people, but only as  possible sources of money. They smile and obey, but  not because they care. <br><br>How could they understand the sorrows of those who have cars and good clothes and plenty to eat? They can’t see that those sorrows are just as real, and painful, as the ones they feel. They can only care for people like themselves; their husbands, unemployed- their children, often sick- their cousins, on drugs- or in jail.<br><br>The social girl with the haunted eyes will get in her car and go home now. Whatever disturbed her will be forgotten. Perhaps, after all,  it was only the cold wind from this ragged child, passing beside her in the night.<br><br><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport8-22.jpg\"><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

That’s what the FU Institute of Youth Sports for Peace, in cooperation with Robinsons Dumaguete, will organize on Oct 10, as a component of the Buglasan Festival celebration.<br><br>Everybody, children, young and old, love a challenge. “Challenges are what make life interesting; overcoming them is what make life interesting…The challenged life may be the best therapist,” authors Joshua Marine and Gail Sheehy tell us.<br><br>“The marathon—the ultimate challenge” was the belief in the 50s and 60s. No more. Because of the fitness and running boom starting in the 60s and resurfacing today in many parts of the country as part of the wellness lifestyle movement, there are now millions of ordinary men and women who have ran the marathon and in the process, the mystic of the marathon, as the ultimate challenge, is gone. The ultimate challenges nowadays are ultra marathons with distances 10åç0 kilometers or more, and extreme sports such as the triathlon, duathlon and the Ironman.<br><br>The triathlon is an event consisting of long distance swimming, biking and running. A duathlon, staged for the first time in Dumaguegte last month, consists of a long distance run, a much longer bike ride, and finishing off with another long run. <br><br>Today, what is considered the ultimate challenge is the Ironman. It is a grueling version of the triathlon with longer distances in each of the three events of swimming, biking and running. This international event is promoted in the Philippines by a milk company whose owners have close links with Silliman University—the Uytengsus.<br><br>Fred Uytengsu, chairman of Sunrise Events, a sports management company formed to stage the Ironman, and project director Princess Galura, are on top of every detail involving the conduct of the Ironman 70.3, consisting of  a 1.2 mile (1.9km) swim, 56-mile (90.1) km) bike, and 13.1 mile (21km) run, or a total distance of 70.3 miles (113.1km). <br><br>Ironman 70.3, with over 840 participants from 34 countries is held in Pili, Camarines Sur, today, Aug 22. <br><br>An interesting sidelight is the staging of the Ironkids, participated in by children ages 6 to 14 years old, with varying distances for the swim, bike and run legs. <br><br>Uytengsu acquired the rights to promote Ironkids from the World Triathlon Corp. (WTC), the same body that owns the globally-recognized Ironman brand.<br><br>Uytengsu said the Ironkids program will inspire and motivate the youth to lead an active, positive and healthy lifestyle. “First and foremost, it’s about participation, provides the participants and their families with a weekend-event experience that is educational, interactive and fun. It’s an enjoyable activity that makes kids feel positive about themselves. The platform of competition inspires and teaches children to improve in all endeavors of life by working hard and persevering.” Amen, we say to that and we hope that a local version of this challenging event for children can be replicated here in our University Town.<br><br>While the challenge of participating in the triathlon, duathlon and ironman attracts that sector of the general population which is willing to bear the great personal sacrifice and endure the extremely physical, mental and emotional hardships of training and preparing for successfully participation, many of us, or most of us ordinary mortals, will not take up the challenge. So, is there another challenge for us—the average fitness and wellness enthusiasts, that is worth considering?<br><br>Yes, there is, and it is within everybody’s capacity to accomplish: the quarter marathon (10.5km) walk.<br><br>As of this date, we at FU have about a thousand people who have successfully finished the quarter marathon, a requirement in our PE program. Some members of our faculty and staff, as part of our institutional wellness program, have likewise walked the distance. This encouraged us to provide opportunities for others in our community to take up the challenge and experience the joy of achievement.<br><br>The staff of the IYSPeace had presented the proposal to Mesdames Christine Tomas and Naddie Orillana, marketing officers of Robinsons, for the staging every three-months of the Robinsons Wellness Challenge: Quarterly Quarter-Marathon Walk. <br><br>As the project denotes, a 10.5-kilometer wellness walk will be held every three months at the Robinsons grounds. Participants will walk 15 laps around the mall. Finishers will be awarded a Certificate of Achievement. We are also currently seeking sponsors for post-walk free coffee and biscuits for the participants. We will also invite the walkers at the Rizal Boulevard and Perdices Stadium to take up the wellness challenge. The choice of the Robinsons Mall for the event is to ensure a safe, traffic hazard free environment for the walker, drinking water for everyone when needed, and immediate medical assistance when necessary. Post-walk repast will be available as we will request the food outlets to open earlier than the usual hours.<br><br>I have likewise proposed to Dr. Nick Elman, Chairman of the Negros Oriental Tourism Council committee in-charged of the celebratory activities for the Buglasan 2010, that we include a Buglasan wellness walk, followed by a wellness exposition promoting our local herbal medicine, spa industry and the local hilot which are all part of the tourism industry program.<br><br>We invite all wellness buffs and enthusiasts in University Town to take up the wellness challenge. To prepare for the event, I advise that one should walk at least one hour a day, three times per week. The walk should be leisurely and the duration should not be less than one hour. Towards the month of Oct, the frequency of walking can be increased to 4-5 days a week. Anybody who could walk for one hour, at least 3 to 5 times a week, should easily meet the challenge of the quarter marathon wellness challenge. <br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

If there are highly- populated, filthy, polluted areas in this metropolis, it is these wetland areas. <br><br>What further adds to the seriousness of the present concern is that these sites are near important landmarks of the city of Manila such as Malacanang Palace and several universities in the University Belt. <br><br>The wonder of it all is that almost everybody in Metro Manila seems to be ignoring the presence of  these pockets of pollution as if they do not exist at all. Yet, when one travels in the city and happens to pass by  these ugly, foul-smelling, heavily-polluted (with trash, garbage, domestic wastes) sites that serve as indicator of environmental neglect,  he cannot ignore them because, like the malodorous Manila Bay, they are in a real sense an insult to our reputation as a people.<br><br>Before I proceed any further, let me confess that having served as the Secretary of the Department of Environment & Natural Resources in 1992-1995, I regret I was not able to do something about these sites. <br><br>Our attention then was focused on fighting a losing battle to stop illegal logging in our rainforests. <br> <br>But let us not talk much about what were not done in the past. The more important thing is to clean up these polluted sites. <br><br>I believe there are many expert people who know about sanitation and drainage systems. Poor drainage or lack of drainage to the sea or to the Pasig River appears to the main reason for the stagnant water in these wetlands. <br><br>Do we need an explanation why dengue fever is rampant around areas with dirty, stagnant water? People in the vicinity throw their household wastes into the water below their houses, worsening the drainge and pollution problems. <br><br>In the past and even at present, many greedy developers have made money by building structures on reclaimed  creeks, obstructing normal drainage  to Manila Bay. <br><br>This reflects an utter ignorance or disregard of the natural functions of wetlands. Why were they allowed to do so? <br>Now, it appears next to impossible to do something about lapses in the past. But is it?<br><br>President Noy has shown that it can be done. If by just a single pronouncement, he was able to stop the much abused wang-wang habit, there is no reason why the esteros, canals and creeks of Metro Manila cannot be cleaned and cleared for  easy drainage to the sea. <br>But the agencies of government tasked with proper drainage should put their skills to action. They better do so; if  they do not,  people in the provinces will follow suit.<br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

For sure, the president, vice presidents,  deans, administrators, faculty  and staff would  have had better salaries and other emoluments elsewhere, but they chose to stay.<br><br>We salute President Ben  Malayang III and Board of Trustees Chairperson  Juanita Dy-Amatong for leading by example -- meeting the challenges of  fiscal  responsibility, in balance with the standard of a Center for Excellence, keeping in mind the foundations of  faith  woven into the fabric of the daily rigors of University Life.<br><br>Congratulations, Silliman University!<br><br>Welcome back to Dumaguete, alumni, friends and family.<br><br>Special congratulations to the Class of 1960 of the SU College of Nursing, especially former professors Cerlizita Cabote and Magdalena Sy who are celebrating their golden anniversary. <br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

She  chomped “magic cake” and  ballooned to  nine feet.  Lifted  from Lewis  Carrol’s  book (1865), the  phrase expresses   a disconnect  between the bizarre  and  the rational. <br><br>“Curiouser  and curiouser”  fits  the  Supreme  Court’s  flip-flop on 16  “cities”. Batac in  Ilocos  Norte,  Naga, Bogo and  Carcar in Cebu,  plus 12 others, were demoted into towns. The Court’s  “final” judgement”, however,  wilted into a  “not-yet-final” ruling. Busted towns were  restored -- unless the  Court decides otherwise, yet again, based on a League of Cities’ protest. <br><br>The 16’s  legal counsel  Estelito Mendoza  wrote a “For-Your-Eyes-Only” letter to the Court  in January 2009. Justices, who didn’t  participate  in  deliberations be allowed to  vote anyway, he asked.<br><br>“Unethical”, snapped  League Vice Chair Paulino Salvador Leachon. “This is completely against the law—to write the court seeking a favorable decision,” the Calapan mayor added…” We  were not provided with those secret documents.”<br><br>“Curiouser and curiouser” describes  adrenalin outbursts of a once-somnolent Ombudsman. Cases mouldered  in the  Ombudsman’s  dusty files. Among these were  the P728-million fertilizer fund scam, the  pillaged road user’s tax to the  ZTE broadband contract. The inaction “bordered on criminal neglect,” Sen.Miriam Santiago asserted. <br><br>Merceditas  Gutierrez shredded raps against the former President and then First Gentleman. By happenstance, he is Gutierrez’s  school chum. Then, she found herself on  the wrong end of an impeachment rap. Overnight, the Ombudsman waddled off to wage  unaccustomed battle against accumulated sleaze.<br><br>She even  retrieved a seven year old case over looted   Cebu  Girl Scout  funds.  Rep.  Clavel Asas-Martinez allocated slabs from her pork barrel for scouts. But  some turned up, on Sept. 22 in  2003, in the lady’s  personal account at BPI  in Pasay City. Pag may salaping tangan, pusa ma’y napapasayaw, the  proverb says. “Money can make the cat dance.”<br><br>An Ombudsman in overdrive also  rapped  the “Euro generals” for toting undeclared 105,000 euros through Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow. “Excess funds from the intelligence budget of the PNP,”the cops stammered. Nonsense. That’s  “private funds,” probers  replied. <br>  <br>Two years late, the Ombudsman  urged  graft raps be lodged against former Philippine National Police comptroller Eliseo de la Paz,  Gen. Avelino Razon Jr., plus  Samuel Rodriguez, Orlando Pestaño, Tomas Rentoy III, Elmer Pelobello, Romeo Ricardo, Emmanuel Carta, Ismael Rafanan, German Doria, Silverio Alarcio Jr., and Jaime Caringal.<br><br>What did the  confidential letter to high court justices, on  allowing 16 towns to rehoist painted–over city hall  signboards,  seek?<br><br>In  his Jan. 19, 2009 letter, Mendoza asked the  Court:  “Allow the participation of  judges who were not physically present  during the deliberation of the Nov. 18, 2008 order.”<br><br>That order  “declared with finality”  that  turning  16 municipalities into cities were unconstitutional. All  16 -- including  Baybay in Leyte;  Lamitan in Basilan; Tabuk in Kalinga; to  El Salvador in Misamis Oriental – flubbed  the P100-million income requirement.<br><br>None of the 16 are qualified, Magsaysay Awardee and DILG secretary Jesse Robredo said from the sidelines. “Let’s wait for the Court’s decision.”<br><br>Did  anyone jump through Mendoza’s  hoop?  The League protested that  Justices  Diosdado Peralta, Lucas Bersamin, Mariano del Castillo, Roberto Abad and Martin Villarama Jr., who didn’t sit in earlier hearings, participated in  December 2009 sessions. They reversed  a  “final” decision.<br><br>“Why  should  a counsel  make a  request to the Supreme  Court when (that) Court  already declared, with finality,  that conversion (of the 16)  was unconstitutional,”a bewildered LCP president  and San Fernando Mayor Oscar Rodriguez asked.  <br><br>The Girl Scout  fund  scandal  stemmed  from  the release of P26 million in three tranches -- two in 2002 and one in 2003. Intended as  “financial assistance”, the cash  was to go  to the GSP Council in Cebu,  reported Gulf Times of  Qatar (Aug 17,2004).<br><br>The  transfer to Martinez’  personal  BPI   account  was not  authorized  by a GSP Council  resolution, the Girl Scout committee report said. Neither were two  separate transactions.  <br> <br>Bogo town – where Martinez’s son, Celestino Martinez III,  was   mayor -- received P7.5million  from Martinez’s  pork barrel. These were deposited in the GSP Council’s trust fund. But  funds were converted into GSP checks payable to cash -- and vanished.<br><br>The transaction took place when Martinez was president of GSP-Cebu. Her daughter Ma Cielo served  as  treasurer, Gulf Times added.  GSP learned  how its funds  caroomed  only  when the Land Bank-Bogo office asked for appropriate  “resolution” from GSP officials.<br><br>“Hogwash”, Martinez  said. She dared the whistleblower to surface.  Regional  Deputy Ombudsman  Virginia  Santiago, however, was not impressed. Instead, she  asked  COA to do a special audit.<br><br>After a seven-year  hibernation, the Ombudsman  suspended  Bogo City treasurer Rhett Minguez and accountant Cresencio Verdida.  ”The order did not mention any action on Clavel Asas-Martinez,” Cebu Daily News noted.<br><br>Minguez attested to  availability of funds. Verdida  certified that  supporting documents were complete. The suspended officials conspired in  laundering of GSP funds, the Ombudsman claimed.<br><br>Is this where the buck stops? “This is getting curiouser and curiouser,”Alice would have murmured.<br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Amante, dean of the SU Medical School, said they prepared their students by giving them a one-year review after graduation.<br><br>Faculty members of the College of Medicine had earlier expressed confidence in the graduates, and at least one was overheard as saying he would stop teaching if their students did not pass the board examinations.<br><br>Of the new doctors, Cabristante, Partosa, Salindo, and Saycon were scholars of the Province of Negros Oriental. The scholarship program, which was started by the late Gov. Emilio Macias II, requires the doctors to serve the province for a few years before they set out for private practice.<br><br>Gov. Agustin Perdices congratulated the new doctors, as he expressed hope for an improvement in the delivery of basic health services in Negros Oriental  with the new doctors joining the Province. However, the number of government doctors, which stands at 44 with the addition of the four scholars, is still short of the 90 doctors needed throughout the province.<br><br>The oathtaking ceremony of the new doctors will be held on Sept. 5.A total of 1,597 examinees passed out of the 2,300 who took the Physician Licensure Exam. <br><br><br><br><font size=\"2\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">Related articles:<br><br>        </span></font><br><br>        <link style=\"font-family: arial;\" rel=\"File-List\" href=\"file:///Users/joelpal/Library/Preferences/Microsoft/Clipboard/msoclip1/01/clip_clip_filelist.xml\"><br><br>        <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml><br><br>        <o:documentproperties><br><br>        <o:template>Normal</o:template><br><br>        <o:revision>0</o:revision><br><br>        <o:totaltime>0</o:totaltime><br><br>        <o:pages>1</o:pages><br><br>        <o:words>114</o:words><br><br>        <o:characters>654</o:characters><br><br>        <o:company>Yorktown Heights, New York</o:company><br><br>        <o:lines>5</o:lines><br><br>        <o:paragraphs>1</o:paragraphs><br><br>        <o:characterswithspaces>803</o:characterswithspaces><br><br>        <o:version>10.2418</o:version><br><br>        </o:documentproperties><br><br>        </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml><br><br>        <w:worddocument><br><br>        <w:zoom>0</w:zoom><br><br>        <w:displayhorizontaldrawinggridevery>0</w:displayhorizontaldrawinggridevery><br><br>        <w:displayverticaldrawinggridevery>0</w:displayverticaldrawinggridevery><br><br>        <w:usemarginsfordrawinggridorigin/><br><br>        </w:worddocument><br><br>        </xml><![endif]--><br><br>        <style><br><br>        <!--<br><br>        /* Style Definitions */<br><br>        p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal<br><br>        {mso-style-parent:\"\";<br><br>        margin:0in;<br><br>        margin-bottom:.0001pt;<br><br>        mso-pagination:widow-orphan;<br><br>        font-size:12.0pt;<br><br>        font-family:Times;}<br><br>        a:link, span.MsoHyperlink<br><br>        {color:blue;<br><br>        text-decoration:underline;<br><br>        text-underline:single;}<br><br>        a:visited, span.MsoHyperlinkFollowed<br><br>        {color:purple;<br><br>        text-decoration:underline;<br><br>        text-underline:single;}<br><br>        @page Section1<br><br>        {size:8.5in 11.0in;<br><br>        margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in;<br><br>        mso-header-margin:.5in;<br><br>        mso-footer-margin:.5in;<br><br>        mso-paper-source:0;}<br><br>        div.Section1<br><br>        {page:Section1;}<br><br>        --> </style><br><br>        <p style=\"font-family: arial;\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--><font size=\"2\"> <a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index76.htm\">Editorial -

   "body": "Will renaming the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital into the Gov. Emilio Macias Provincial Hospital give a bad name to the late Governor? <BR><BR>Board Member Melimoore Saycon thinks so. “It would be much better to improve the services at the NOPH before renaming the hospital. The NOPH is being attacked with complaints because of poor services,” Saycon said during last week’s public hearing of the Ordinance proposed by Board Member Liland Estacion.{{more}}<BR><BR>Complaints, however, are not new to the NOPH, Dr. Felix Sy, NOPH chief, said. <BR><BR>“The hospital has a capacity of only 250 beds but is currently serving over 400 beds because of the influx of patients not just from Negros Oriental but also from neighboring provinces,” he said.  At present, there are only 40 doctors--short by 50 doctors to attain the ideal workforce. The NOPH also lacks other personnel, such as nurses and other hospital staff. <BR><BR>The proposed ordinance aims at giving due recognition and honor to late Governor Macias, who was responsible for the successful implementation of the provincial health system. <BR><BR>Dr. Dante Domingo, chief of the Provincial Hospital System said among the accomplishments of late Gov. Macias is the establishment of Community Primary Hospitals in the hinterland barangays of the province. The establishment of CPH has earned the province a Galing Pook Award in Public Service. In fact, it has become a model program to other provinces in the country because of its innovative concept.<BR><BR>Dr. Domingo said the late governor also established the Negros Oriental Diagnostic Laboratory which is the first diagnostic center established by a Provincial Hospital in the county. Macias also allocated funding for the residency training of Ob-Gynecology doctors, acquisition of modern health care facilities and laboratory equipment, computerized information system, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), new x-ray machine, CT scan, computerized radiology system and the ongoing four-story construction of central block building.<BR><BR>Leo Mamicpic, a resident of barangay  Banilad, however, said changing the NOPH name may cause confusion. “The NOPH is already established and besides, not all people were supporters of the late Governor,” he said. Mamicpic then proposed to leave the name NOPH alone and instead, rename the Provincial Diagnostic Center after Macias. <BR><BR>Board Member Edmund Dy, meanwhile, challenged his colleagues to improve the services of the NOPH. He said he hopes that everyone will take their inspiration from Gov. Macias, who was known for his priority programs towards health.<BR><BR>Dr. Estacion said they will consider all ideas and suggestions raised during the public hearing. She said a second public hearing has been scheduled for the second week of September. She is optimistic that the proposed ordinance will be passed and approved.

CENTROP is the first captive breeding facility established in the 1990’s at Silliman University.<BR><BR>It maybe recalled that former Vice-Governor Jose Baldado batted for a rescue center where recovered wildlife can be kept and bred in captivity.<BR><BR>The confiscated or rescued wildlife species in the province can be brought to CENTROP for rehabilitation, safekeeping and propagating. <BR>Illegal possession, trade and transport of endangered species are punishable acts under Republic Act 9147, or the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act.

   "body": "Power consumers in the province and the entire Negros Island will expect more power outages in the coming months as the power supply deficit affecting the entire Negros Island is expected to stretch until December this year.  {{more}}<BR><BR>This was disclosed by Engr. Elvin Dennoyo, chief of operations and maintenance division of Negros Oriental Electric Cooperative I based in Bindoy during a Kapihan forum held in Mabinay town recently.<BR><BR>Dennoyo said that the power deficit is the main reason behind the rotating brownouts experienced by NORECO I’s coverage areas.<BR> <BR>He explained that the Visayas power grid- spanning Panay, Negros, Bohol, Cebu and Leyte islands – is controlled by a system operator which is the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP).<BR>NGCP is in charge of the power transmission in the Visayas and during the time there is a lack of power supply, they contact the electric cooperative to inform them that they need to drop a couple of megawatts of power. <BR><BR>“So what we do is we rotate the brownout feeder by feeder from 30 minutes to 1 hour,” said Dennoyo.<BR><BR>He added that there are even times when NORECO I is åcaught unaware and its entire coverage area is plunged into a blackout. “These are times, especially during emergency situations, when NGCP will shut us down without any prior notice. These are during cases when the power voltage has sunk so low and the frequency has run down that NGCP needs to immediately shut down the power,” he said.<BR><BR>Dennoyo explained that the problem on the power deficit in the island will only be addressed once the two power plants in Cebu start operating next year. <BR><BR>As early as now, NORECO I has inked a contract with KEPCO, a coal plant in Cebu to ensure that power supply in Negros Oriental will stabilize next year. “Naniguro mi nga makahatag  mi ug ensakto nga power supply sa among consumers,” he stressed. <BR><BR>Dennoyo expects the power supply in the Visayas to stabilize once said power plants start operating commercially. <BR><BR>Four of the five provinces covered by the Visayas power grid are experiencing a power deficit. <BR><BR>Foremost is Cebu province which only generates 141mw of power yet its demand is pegged at 403mw.<BR><BR>Negros Island’s actual power generation is at 118 mw while its power demand is at 157mw.<BR><BR>On the other hand, Panay needs 102mw of power but its actual power generated is only at 69mw while Bohol’s power demand is at 36mw yet it only generates 17mw.<BR> <BR>Leyte is the only province whose actual power generation, which is at 514mw, is higher than its demand of 161 mw.

Our own graduates don’t have to go elsewhere to study medicine. They can save a lot of money by getting quality medical education right in their own hometown!<br><br>In any course, especially one that requires a board examination, the pioneering batch is always the most difficult, because this is the batch that everyone will be waiting for. This batch’s performance will either make or break the college. But with the stunning 100 percent passing, the SU Medicine School can be assured that it will not be wanting in students in the coming years.<br><br>This is a wonderful achievement not only for Silliman but for the team of doctors in Negros Oriental led by Dr. Jonathan Amante, who had long been toying with the idea of starting a medical school. It was an idea whose time had come.<br><br>The 100 percent passing average is also a triumphant moment for the province of Negros Oriental because four of the seven new doctors were scholars of the Province. <br><br>Under this scholarship program initiated by the late Gov. Emilio Macias II, these doctors will be required to serve Negrenses for a few years before they go out to more lucrative frontiers.<br><br>With so many reasons to rejoice, the success of the seven new doctors is not just Silliman’s success.

The contingents will dance to the synchronized beat of the music, which will be heard over Killer Bee DYSR through business establishments along the city streets that have signified to tune in to the station in the duration of the Parada.<br><br>Other members of the Silliman community who are not part of the Parada can choose to wait for the contingents at the Filemono Cimafranca Ballfield (SU Ballfield) where a Unity Service will serve to culminate the occasion.

They believe the night air is filled with dreams. To spare their children from bad dreams, they hang a dream catcher over their beds. <br><br>The web dream catcher allows only beautiful dreams to teach the children natural wisdom. The web traps the bad dream, exposes it to the light of a rising sun to evaporate like the morning dew.<br>  <br>The dream catcher, a hoop of willow, helps its recipient to attain his goal by means of the beautiful dream’s idea and vision.<br><br>This is the challenge which confronts Victor Vicente “Dean” Sinco to save Foundation University from a bad dream, and allow only the beautiful dream to secure the education of students from poor families in Negros Oriental and from the neighboring provinces. <br> <br>In running the gauntlet, Dean Sinco steps into the big shoes of his illustrious grandfather and namesake Dr. Vicente G. Sinco, who established FU in 1949 to serve the needs of financially-challenged students.<br><br>Dr. Sinco is endeared in the hearts of the gentle people of Dumaguete not only as a founder of FU. He is remembered as well as the ninth president of the University of the Philippines.  <br><br>On top, Filipinos recall that Dr. Sinco signed the UN Charter in behalf of the government as Philippine Commissioner of Foreign Affairs.  <br><br>In Dean’s recollection, his GrandDad and the Sinco siblings latched on to a dream, and set on a mission to establish an education institution for the common people.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">FU’s Bad Dream</span><br></div><br><br>        Dean’s Dad Leandro Sinco’s involvement with the school started on Day 1 until 1968 when the family left for the USA. Things then were going well for the institution.  From 1968 to 1990, FU blipped out from Dean’s radar screen, except for a brief moment in 1988 when his GrandDad passed away.<br><br>In 1994, Leandro decided to opt for retirement from his teaching position in the University of Washington to go home to Dumaguete.  He made the hard choice after being appraised by long distance calls that FU was floundering.  <br><br>FU’s finances were on the red. On the verge of bankruptcy, the Sinco family members wanted it liquidated, perhaps for a song, in Dean’s recollection. No one wanted to touch the University anymore. Still, his Dad persevered and invited him as well to join in masterminding the University’s turnaround.<br><br>It was a hard decision to transplant his family from Hawaii to Dumaguete.  After a year of soul-searching, his family chose to join a father-and-son team to resuscitate an ailing University.  In doing so, he left his own architectural firm in Hawaii that had eight employees and which earned for him some $10,000 per month.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Dream Inheritor</span><br></div><br><br>        Father-and-son duo became the inheritor of Dr. Vicente Sinco’s dream when no one else dared to assume responsibility of a University that was on a downhill skid.  <br><br>An architect by his calling, Dean threw and lost himself out in giving a brand new look to FU’s broken down physical plant. <br> <br>With limited resources, Dean applied his belief that the path to success requires proper surroundings. To reinvent FU’s state of mediocrity, he started by designing and constructing two campus gates that gave a spark of life to a decaying foundation.  He also gave a sparkle to the Sylvan Amphitheater which inspired Mayor Odol Gonzalez to duplicate it in Valencia.  <br><br>The re-invention process reverberated to the classroom, canteen, and library buildings. The sprucing up was done until the rundown and worn out school got the look of a premier university.<br><br>FU students’ old drab uniform did not escape the Architect’s discriminating eye. Dean changed the plaid table cloth material, and morphed it with an avant garde comfortable design that FU students now wear in campus, and anywhere else, with heads up high.  <br><br>But what is creating a double impact is equipping the students with the latest technological skills, and affording them with the latest electronic gadgets.  <br><br>The entire FU campus is now on a WIFI wave blanket.  Any student with a computer anywhere in campus can access the Internet.  The Elementary and High School laboratories are made conducive to being techno-savvy as they are equipped with Apple Macintosh computers on a 1:1 ratio to the students.<br><br>The teachers’ competency and character likewise get a good deal of attention from the Dream Inheritor.  Dean wants higher credentials for all.  He puts Dr. Aparicio Mequi in-charge in assisting the teachers diligently to acquire Master’s degrees and possibly PhD’s. <br> <br>Far more important is the sharing and publication of relevant research and dissertation, as Dean instills to the teachers that credible research garners credible respect.  <br><br>A CHED certificate citing FU as a “Center for Excellence in Research and IT”, the Inheritor underscores, only comes from hard work.<br><br>The CHED accreditation team which visited the University last July confirmed the great leap forward FU has made in the past years.  Team members noted that FU has acquired infra- and academic facilities that some premier universities in Manila have been found wanting. <br>    <br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Dream Inception</span><br></div><br><br>        To hitch the dream a notch higher, Victor Vicente as chair of the Board of Trustees is taking a bolder step.  He is morphing from dream catching to dream inception -- from dream catcher to dream extractor.  <br><br>Like Leonardo DiCaprio in the sci-fi  action movie Inception,  Dean intends to implant his own ideas on the dreamer. The Grand Dad’s dream is now the Grandson’s dream, with a significant difference. <br>Dr. Sinco conceived his dream at a time when high tech was not yet available.  The grandson is turning his dream into reality when cyberspace is transforming the world into a global village.  It is the high-tech edge that Dean is working conscientiously on, to infuse into the bloodstream of the FU populace to give its graduates the incisive quality in any highly-competitive field of a shrinking world.<br><br>With an Apple iPad in his hand, Dean showed a staff member how it’s going to change everything in education. With an on-campus WIFI, FU is digitizing its entire library. The iPad will enable its student to read a digital download without going to the library. The student may even read a book download from any digital library of the world whether it be in Tokyo, Paris, London or New York.  <br><br>Dean is encouraging the students and staff to keep in step with the latest advances in technology. He is also reinventing their annual exhibit Digital Dumaguete. He is treating the upcoming event as a job fair for the FU students and graduates, to give them better employment opportunities over their competitors from other schools. This time around, FU students and their work will be the stars of the show with exhibitors/employers from outside Dumaguete as the side show.<br><br>The reinvention underscores the need to get people to appreciate the talent that has been developed in Foundation University over the years.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Dream Web</span><br></div><br><br>        Victor Vicente is a believer in the exponential power of networking.  With FU having limited resources in pursuing a preferential education for the poor, he has enlisted the support and trust of philanthropists.  The Board of Trustees is giving moral support.  <br><br>Just recently, the Board admitted  seven corporate members who have given significant contributions to the University’s academic and extension programs.  They are well-established and respected in their chosen fields of profession or discipline, and lend prominence to FU’s academic standing here and abroad. <br> <br>An IT Development engineer at Microsoft Corp., academicians from premiere universities in Manila and abroad, successful entrepreneurs, the president of Royal Savings Bank -- to name a few -- will give FU a network of well-established names.<br><br>The chairman of the Board, Dean Sinco, said the addition of the new members will greatly enhance FU’s ability to address incoming challenges and opportunities. He said he hopes to widen the partnership in days ahead.   <br><br>Waiting to be tapped is a big reservoir of goodwill from FU alumni scattered all over the world.  An alumni network can easily be reached via the on-campus WIFI of the University.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Dream Catcher</span><br></div><br><br>        Dean surrounds the University with a beautiful physical plant. The Board oversees FU with trusted names in their chosen fields of profession or discipline. The teachers are happy upgrading their qualifications and competencies. The students are proud even in merely wearing the University uniform. With glee, the parents enroll their children at FU as a University of the Common Tao. A number of philanthropists are supporting the mission. All of these are consequences of the good intention and handiwork of the Dream Catcher.<br><br>Above all, Victor Vicente is happiest because of the support of his family through thick and thin.<br><br>The impulse of dreaming, however, is catching up on the Dream Catcher. Dream Extractor becomes him. He is superimposing his own dream at a time when there is a challenge to his leadership. Seeing the downgrading of the learning environment in a congested small city,  Dean dreams of Foundation University atop Valencia where the greeneries still aplenty and the air afresh.  The new University campus will be nestled on a 24-hectare area above sea level, and the other educational institutions in the low-lying plain.<br><br>Victor Vicente is confident the plan is doable. In an interview with Glynda Descuatan of SkyCable, Dean  asked, “How do you eat an elephant?”  <br><br>In answering himself, he mused, “Bite by bite.”  <br><br>Dean has the track record for all FU stockholders to trust him to do it.  <br> <br>Given the trust and support of all FU stockholders, Victor Vicente, already a winner, can sketch, design, and construct the FU of his dream chunk-by-chunk.  <br><br>That is where Dean, the Architect, is good at -- turning a dream into reality.<br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>The Ateneo School of Government were in Dumaguete City on Aug. 16, 2010 to call on the Hon. Mayor Manuel “Chiquiting” Sagarbarria to discuss matters regarding the possibility of having a partnership between the Ateneo and local government unit of Dumaguete and the civil society group.   The goal? To improve the systems on the effective delivery of services to the constituents. <BR><BR>One way of doing this is by launching their program called “Government Watch.” Their first visit to the Mayor was their initial assesment of the possibility of having the program here in Dumaguete, leaving the City Mayor’s Office with encouraging remarks. <BR><BR>The Mayor discussed with them his 4 Ps of governance: private,  sector, public sector, people’s organizations, partnership. He emphasized that he believes in participative leadership as the secret of productive and effective governance.<BR><BR>Other issues discussed during the visit with the Ateneo School of Government included environment protection. <BR><BR>It was on this light that Mayor Sagarbarria informed them that he was requesting the four universities in the City, namely Silliman University, Foundation University, Negros Oriental State University, and St. Paul University, to conduct surveys and relevant studies on environment impact to determine the core problem and come up with concrete solutions.<BR><BR>Another concern that the Mayor discussed with the Ateneo folks was his goal to improve the financial aspect of the City government. <BR>Mayor Chiquiting said he was also proposing the setting up of a new building that would house under one roof the City’s financial systems. He envisions this to materialize by January 2011, including a  Taxpayers’ Lodge.<BR><BR>Another concern the Mayor emphasized is the systematic processing of business permits that can be completed in a single day. He lamented that the current processing of permits for as long as one or two weeks indicates a faulty system, causing inconvenience to the businessmen. Mayor Chiquiting said such system must be changed.<BR>The concluding note of the discussion was about the creation of the two-week- old Task Force SAGARR or Special Action Group Advocating Rapid Reforms.<BR><BR>Task Force SAGARR will serve as an umbrella of all the existing task forces without duplicating their respective mandates such as Bantay-Syudad, Market Task Force, Indecency Task Force, and others.<BR>With these happy developments, the City Mayor’s Office will continue to link with NGOs, POs, and civil society groups, carrying out their program “Government Watch”.<BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "<BR>All three of them had something in common. Pretty, smiling faces, exuberant, and in all cases, were from poor families. I knew all three of them personally. And I often interacted with them. Let’s give them fictitious names to protect their identity.<BR><BR>Weena was enrolled in my PE 1 class in the first semester of 2006. Fair-skinned with blondish hair and ready smile, she was easily recognizable on campus. Whenever I saw her between classes, I would ask her how her grades were, and smilingly, she would answer that they were good. She was taking up nursing, her schooling financed by a sister working abroad. In her junior year, she fell in love, and I often saw her and her boyfriend at Sunday mass, holding hands even as they bowed their heads in solemn prayer. I was thrilled at the sight of two young people deeply in love. <BR><BR>One day, I learned that Weena dropped out from school. Nobody knew where she was. Later on, I learned that she got pregnant. When she came back to school, what I saw was an entirely different girl. The healthy body looked frail, the smiling face looked drawn with premature wrinkles covering her forehead, and when I tried to talk to her, she was evasive and didn’t seem eager to talk to me. One day, I asked her if her baby was a boy or a girl and she quickly answered “Boy”, and hurried away unable to hear me say: “Good, when he’s grown up, you have somebody to protect you.” <BR><BR>Maryjane was taking a business management course, was a student assistant, and a member of the Junior Red Cross. She was the most responsible student I ever had assigned to help me manage the marathon clinic and sports events I organized. She was always the first to arrive at the Rizal Blvd. where I first held the Dumaguete marathon races; and assembly time was at 5 a.m. Arriving very early ahead of everybody, she would sit on one of the benches, bend over and rest her head on the medicine box she was carrying, and take a nap while waiting for the start of the race. When assigned to handle first aid in sporting events that would start at 7 a.m. and end as late as 9 p.m., she would be there, leaving only her post for short breaks. I think, it was her loyalty to her assignment that carried the Junior Red Cross to back-to-back awards as the most outstanding student organization on campus. In her senior year, Maryjane got pregnant and dropped out of school completely.<BR>Charisse had a bright future ahead of her taking up agribusiness. I encouraged her to get good grades, and who knows, I would tell her, “Someday, you might be manager of the FU farm in Amlan.” Towards the end of her senior year, she got pregnant by her boyfriend who was also an SA. She, too, had to drop out of school.<BR><BR>Another thing that was common among them was that they were required to leave school because of an institutional policy regarding unmarried girls getting pregnant. An unwritten rule of many academic institutions like Foundation University is that any unmarried girl who gets pregnant must file a leave of absence and leave school. No girl who fell into the predicament of pregnancy ever attempted to contest this unwritten code of conduct.<BR><BR>Let’s first consider the following statistics before we go any further: In the Philippines, a study conducted by the UP Population Institute and the Demographic Research Foundation in 2002 showed that 26 percent of Filipino youth nationwide, ages 15 to 25, admitted to have had premarital sex, and that 38 percent are in a living-in arrangement. <BR><BR>The 1998 National Demographic & Health Survey indicated that 3.6 million of Filipino teenagers (that’s 5.2 percent of our population) got pregnant. In 92 percent of these teens, the pregnancy was unplanned, and 78 percent did not use contraceptives the first time they had sexual intercourse. Many of them were ignorant of the fact that a single act of intercourse could get a girl pregnant. <BR><BR>These stats show that the stories of Weena, Maryjane, and Charisse are not isolated cases of teen-aged girls getting pregnant, who experience either an interrupted period of studies, or dropped out of school completely. <BR><BR>While some manage to come back to school, get their degrees, and rebuild their lives, others suffer the consequences of unfinished schooling, or the health risks of early pregnancy such as malnutrition, inadequate pre-natal care, abortion, fetal death, or cervical cancer.<BR><BR>Although abortion is illegal in the Philippines, it is shocking to note a higher abortion rate of 25/1000 women here compared to the USA where abortion is legal at 23/1000 women. The rate could even be higher if data on back door abortions resorted to with hilots  are available. <BR><BR>Not all co-eds who get pregnant are able to rebuild their lives by going back to school and continue with their studies. In an article titled Unwed, pregnant—and kicked out written by Rachel C. Balawid, she attributes the reason to why many teen-aged girls fail to rebuild their lives after getting pregnant: the “long-time policy of most Catholic schools…which consists of granting a leave of absence, or outright expulsion”.<BR><BR>The implementing rules and regulations of R.A. 9710, otherwise known as the Magna Carta of Women, forbids all forms of discrimination against women, including a school’s refusal to grant enrollment or work to unmarried pregnant students and teachers. <BR>Not all agree, however, as some sectors say the provision is not just unconstitutional, but may even be sending the wrong signals to the youth.<BR><BR>Section 13 of the MCW particularly provoked the most instances of debate among authors of the law and the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines: “Expulsion and non-readmission of women faculty due to pregnancy outside of marriage shall be outlawed. No primary or secondary school shall turn out or refuse admission to female student solely on the account of her having contracted pregnancy outside of marriage during her term in school.”<BR><BR>A congressman opposed to the law posited that this provision is “an impermissible intrusion into the practice of religion and the academic freedom of an institution. <BR><BR>Under state and civil laws, pre-marital sex and getting pregnant out of wedlock are not illegal and immoral. This is possible if a single woman who gets pregnant does not run counter to the mission, vision, or objective of a particular educational institution. <BR>It could be applicable in state colleges, universities and other private institutions that do not in any way adhere to a particular religion that abhors pregnancy out of wedlock. <BR><BR>But if they are going to insist on a particular theology, religion precept for that matter which insists on high standards of morality and decency, that is an exercise of religion. Therefore, it contradicts the freedom of religion of a constitution in a community. <BR><BR>A Catholic school’s role is to teach the Catholic faith and to inculcate in its students Catholic morals. Extramarital sex is wrong according to its moral theology. It is, therefore, a practice of the Catholic faith to impose sanctions on those who violate this moral teaching, among them, the denial of the privilege to teach or to study at a Catholic school. <BR><BR>A private educational institution has the freedom to choose whom to teach and who shall be allowed to teach. These people should be those who adhere to religion and standards of morality. So it’s just simple. Don’t enroll in a Catholic school if you do not want to follow their rules,” explained the congressman. <BR><BR>One of the authors of the law, however, pointed out that the issue was not about violating academic freedom of educational institutions but the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. “The right of academic institutions ends when the impingement of the human rights of individuals begin. This was the reason why the law was passed because of instances where society looked down on women because their decisions do not conform with what is believed to be morally right by some sectors.”<BR><BR>The opposing congressman also believes that letting pregnant students or teachers stay in school will create negative effects on other students. “If you allow her to stay, it will create so much confusion, antipathy, and antagonism. The concern is not only her, but the community. This goes for teachers who should be worthy of emulation. If they get pregnant out of wedlock, they will no longer be in compliance of their principal responsibility of being role models to the students.” <BR><BR>Balawid also reported that St. Scholastica College of Manila imposed the leave of absence policy on unmarried pregnant students which allowed them to re-enroll after giving birth and undergoing counseling. <BR><BR>However, in compliance with the Magna Carta, the LOA is now optional. The pregnant girl may continue going to school until two week before her due date, in which case, she will file for a leave of absence. <BR><BR>The SSCM dean of students said: “We are a Catholic school and one of the major values that Jesus taught us is compassion. This dictates that we don’t expel a student who’s suddenly in a quandary because she got pregnant and she’s not married, and is going to give birth to a child who will not have a father…Its all about being humane, compassionate and giving the much-needed second chances.”<BR><BR>The genesis of our University Town was laid down by two of the oldest universities in our country, one founded by Protestant missionaries and another by Catholic nuns. Foundation University, a non-sectarian institution may be characterized as conservative, meaning, it strictly adheres to traditional standards of conduct and moral values. <BR><BR>Which makes me ask the question: “What is our University Town’s attitude towards teen pregnancy?” Do we have a collective and shared mindset regarding this social problem which, because of the provisions of the Marna Carta of Women, challenge our traditional beliefs about young people indulging in premarital sex and suffering the consequences of this behavior?<BR><BR>As an academic community, we pride ourselves as champions of environmental ethics. But where are we positioned in terms of human ethics? To answer this question, there is an urgent need for all of us in academe to break out from the walls of our campuses, parochial turfs, and mindsets, come together and address this issue of youth sexual behavior. <BR><BR>I dread the thought that one day, we shall have adopted the model in other countries where a girl, upon reaching the age of menarche, is advised to take contraceptive pills. I shudder at the thought that one day, our school clinics will be dispensing “morning-after pills” to girls and condoms to boys. <BR><BR>There must be a sensible and intelligent way to confront and solve this urgent problem. Will somebody in University Town take the initiative to lead?<BR><BR>",

It’s true that women always need more room to sit in the CR, while men can mostly stand; still it’s doubtful that they need twice as much room. <br><br>It’s not only in CRs that women get preference. They do better in boarding houses, which commonly  advertise rooms “only for Lady”; they dominate the work force, where service and  salespeople are usually female; and they are a majority in colleges, where most of the students and faculty are women.<br><br>Women are not usually construction workers or stevedores, which is understandable; certain occupations are reserved for men. But as these men make their way home, they often stop at  little stores to have a few beers with their friends; and the store is almost always owned -- by a woman.<br><br>Women may also be Presidents; but men usually get to be Generals, Cabinet Secretaries and Chief Executives. Below that level, women increasingly rise. In the Upper Middle sections of the culture, women already have an edge; in the working middle, and in the home, they dominate the culture completely. Only at the very bottom do the men rise again. On the streets at night, the drug addicts and the sleeping drunks are rarely women.<br><br>In a place so heavily dominated by women in the school, in the <br>workplace and in the home, the “macho” attitudes of boys and men seem defensive; more gestures of defiance than  a show of real strength and leadership. Even the drunken violence of  some men toward the women in their lives seems not  to come from a desire to dominate, but from the frustrations they feel at their lack of power. <br><br>Still, any human population is always evenly split between men and women in number; so whatever relations between them persist must happen by mutual consent. Despite protest, there are advantages in being dominated. If women hold the power, they also bear the responsibility; <br>and the men are content to be irresponsible from boyhood on.<br><br>This sign on the wall, with 2 CRs for females and only one for males, is colored a pale pink -- not the most masculine color.  But notice also that the light switch on the wall is slightly tilted, skewed off center, badly mounted by the construction workers, who were certainly men.<br><br><br><br><br><img src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport8-29-10.jpg\" align=\"LEFT\"\" border=\"0\"><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></html>",

It is a common observation that coastal areas exposed to the northeast monsoon develop rough seas but those on the opposite rain-shadow side are calm. This situation is especially pronounced if there exists a high mountain on a moderately sized volcanic island, such as Negros.<br><br>The point I would like to emphasize in this column is that, although coral reef fish recruitment took place the year round, the peaks in species richness and density occurred during the relatively calm months with minimal winds in the marine waters on the lee side of southern Negros. <br><br>Factors associated with the relatively calm season included temperature but not rainfall. This is demonstrated for the first time in the recently published paper of Rene Abesamis and Garry Russ. <br><br>Abesamis is a research Fellow of the Silliman University-Angelo King Center, and Garry Russ is professor at James Cook University, Townsville, Australia.<br><br>This phenomenon was first hinted by Daniel Pauly, one of the great fishery scientists, but demonstrated by Abesamis and Russ. I will not be surprised if this significant finding will trigger more research activities on reef fish recruitment in an archipelago like the Philippines. Those who read this column will understand why research to better understand nature is necessary. <br><br>The role of monsoon-related fish recruitment patterns just described must have evolved in the past, just like most other biological or ecological trends in nature. This is the academic lesson learned.<br><br>But we must ask about the implications for the present and for the future. <br><br>The present status of the coastal areas of the country is not one to be proud of. Fishery experts and marine scientists are worried that most fishery productive marine areas have become depleted, and management effort to restore the productivity should be their urgent and priority concern.  <br><br>Certainly, the finding must be applied to strategies of conservation. For one thing, it is clear that conservation needs to be done during the whole reproductive period of the species on which we depend for our well being. <br><br> One of the problems beyond our ability to control is the extreme weather conditions expected because of climate change. If the weather changes involve extended periods of rough and stormy seas, the expectation would be less fish recruitment and less fish catches in the future. <br><br>Under such conditions, what are we to do?<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

SULAW President Lester Nuique, with  a touch of humor, but  with rhyme and reason, celebrated his journey from Aggie to the Bar in the most literal sense,  sharing growing pains, trials and tribulations of a law student’s ordeal -- with foremost Bar buddy Enteng dela Plaza and his drinking family who may be too embarrassed to be mentioned by name.    <br>  <br>Probably this mix of serious intent and dedication to “tongue in cheek” humor, Lester decided to invite two prize fighters to the activities of SULAW -- Dr. Rolando del Carmen and Cong. Manny Pacquiao.<br><br>When Rolando Del Carmen  was  appointed dean of  the SU College of Law in 1962, his first graduates were the golden batch of Class 66 with a 100 percent passing in the Bar:   Humilde  Serate, Joshua Capunong, Jose Hernando Jr., Rene Gutierrez,  Arturo Santos,  Fructoso Villarin II,   and two Bar topnotchers:  Francisco Dy Yap (4th place), and Delia Sutton-(13th place). <br><br>Dean Rolando Del Carmen is now an expert on Criminal Justice in the United States where he lives with his lovely wife, Josie, and is  an author of books and publications which are quoted in Supreme Court decision all over the world. <br><br>He shared his thoughts on justice which he considers innate in the nature of man. It is primordial since the beginning of time, and is a constant theme in  biblical writings. <br><br>The struggle for justice is continuing, for “there can be no justice if there is no rule of law, and no one should be above the law”.<br><br> Del Carmen said it is obvious that President Ninoy’s No wang-wang policy is a simplistic and symbolic concept of what it is all about. He concluded with the suggestion of changing the lyrics of the song Let there be Peace on Earth with the  word “Justice”, and that this would be more apt and fitting to remind everyone of his or her duties towards Justice for All. <br><br>              *****<br><br>Cong.Emmanuel  ”Manny”  Pacquiao was a giant among the legal Eagles. His life story is inspiring   and known the world over that he was introduced very briefly like a bikini -- covering only the essential  parts -- by his Sillimanian constituent lawyer Antonio Delim of Saranggani. <br><br>Manny came through as a very sincere person, with a transparent desire to share his blessings and positive karma.  One cannot help but like the guy, and even be held in awe by his mercurial success. <br>But Manny is like a lawyer with his fists, bringing honor to his country with each fight. <br><br>A lawyer has to  do legal duel in advocating for his client. He uses his mental skills, but we have heard of tales of those who have used their fists to settle an issue. <br><br>Well, if Manny was a lawyer, we would all want to watch him fight to victory with his fists. <br><br>But one cannot be a champion in any field without brawn and brains. For that, Manny is the best “Pound for Pound Boxer” in the world. <br>It is was a draw  because Dr. Lando Del Carmen admitted he is an avid fan of Manny, and collects the  films on his fights; Manny was also in awe of all the lawyers,  but his idea of “horizontal leadership” impressed Dr. Del Carmen.<br> <br>Being members of the mutual admiration club, SULAW, with Lester,  Dean Mikhail Lee Maxino, and former Dean Myles Bejar, really made the anniversary memorable, and allowed for time for reunions, renewals of friendships, recollections, especially with the presence of Cong. George Arnaiz and classmates especially Justice Ramon Bato. <br><br>Before parting, the words of the Silliman song rang out: Loyal will we be to Silliman!”<br><br>Happy trip to all alumni, friends, and family!  Come back to Silliman soon.<br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Three years ago, a deranged man held his own wards hostage in the same area under similar circumstances. Since no one died then, I suppose there weren’t any lessons in media coverage worth learning?  <BR><BR>And to cap off this dubious achievement, said deranged person became the subject of several interviews while the latest crisis was ongoing.<BR><BR>And now they talk of guidelines and rules: that perhaps, just perhaps, a news blackout might work for the best in critical situations. <BR><BR>But really, what’s new here? Didn’t ABS-CBN impose a news blackout when the Abu Sayyaf abducted their star reporter Ces Drilon? Didn’t they ask the same of the other news agencies? Since no ABS-CBN reporter was held hostage this time, I suppose they didn’t think a news blackout worth considering?<BR><BR>If only the broadcast media would come out quickly and decisively with a statement of regret, with a firm resolution to act responsibly in the future. <BR><BR>But no, what we get instead is an extended drama of self-justification drawn out, it seems, for the things that truly matters to the network: airtime, coverage, viewership, and self-promotion.<BR><BR>",

Josy Limkaichong said while she respects the decision of the Supreme Court, she feels sad for Guihulngan and the first district.<BR><BR>“The increase in the Internal Revenue Allotment could have helped develop economic activity in Guihulngan. Guihulngan used to get an IRA of 80 to 90 million a year but with cityhood, it became P340 million. This will undoubtedly have an effect on the entire District,” she said.<BR><BR>On the other hand, Limkaichong said this should be an eye-opener for people who take shortcuts, which many people feel was how Guihulngan’s cityhood came about. <BR><BR>The 16 affected local government units are asking the Supreme Court that they be allowed to present oral arguments, considering that the composition of the Justices has changed. “But there’s a reason for everything so if it will not be granted their request to present oral arguments, Guihulngan will have to prove what it is worth and resort to local initiatives to raise money.”<BR><BR>The reversion of Guihulngan back to a municipality will also have an impact on the salary scale of its employees as well as the status of additional positions created like the schools division of Guihulngan, and the fate of its ninth and tenth councilors. Cities require ten councilors while municipalities only need eight. <BR><BR>“I hope the Department of Interior and Local Government will allow them to continue serving the people because they were elected by the people,” Limkaichong said. <BR><BR>She also said that a Representative, she will revisit the law creating cities as embodied in the Local Government Code. “I’m looking at the possibility of sharing the IRA between cities and municipalities so that only a local government unit’s population and land area will be the basis for the determination of cityhood.<BR>With the drop in IRA, Guihulngan as a municipality should come up with innovative ways to earn funds. “I will be there to help them,” Limkaichong assured.<BR><BR>Apart from Guihulngan, the other cities which were reverted to towns are Baybay in Leyte, Bogo in Cebu, Catbalogan in Samar, Tandag in Surigao del Sur, Lamitan in Basilan, Borongan in Samar, Tayabas in Quezon, Tabuk in Kalinga, Bayugan in Agusan del Sur, Batac in Ilocos Norte, Mati in Davao Oriental,  Cabadbaran in Agusan del Norte, El Salvador in Misamis Oriental, Carcar in Cebu and Naga in Cebu.<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

The total number of dengue cases recorded in the government and private hospitals in Negros Oriental stood at 594 cases as of August 26. The good news, if you can call it that, is that this year’s total dengue cases is still lower than last year’s 762. But this could still increase due to the rains, the Department of Health officials tell us.<BR><BR>This time where dengue fever is at its highest is a regular occurrence not only in Dumaguete and Negros Oriental but in the entire country, where a total of four strains of dengue have already been recorded. <BR><BR>The dengue-carrying mosquito has been around for quite some time now. We have come to know that dengue can be fatal but its deadly effects can be effectively mitigated by prevention, early detection and treatment. <BR><BR>Maintaining clean surroundings and getting rid of plants or waste materials that hold stagnant water is an effective way of preventing the Aedis egypti mosquito from multiplying. Another way of preventing dengue is to wear clothing that covers a big part of your body--wearing tubeless blouses and short shorts should be discouraged at this time of the year. <BR><BR>Dengue cannot be totally eradicated but if we adopt the simple risk-mitigating measures, we can remain dengue free in the months to come.<BR>",

   "body": "LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA -- Four years ago, The LA Times generously donated some used equipment to Foundation University, a non-profit college in the Philippines founded by my grandfather.  The gift included a pair of well-worn Canon EOS 1Ds, a 28-70mm zoom, a 70-200mm zoom, and two strobes. These hand-me-downs proved to be a godsend to the School, located in the provincial town of Dumaguete City where decent camera equipment doesn’t come easy. <BR><BR>Hersley Ven Casero, then 21 and working toward a bachelor’s degree in marketing, dove in immediately when the cameras arrived. Through the lens, he found another way to express his love of art. <BR><BR>Since 2006, I have visited the Philippines each year to see my family and attend to business. I also make it a point to mentor students like Hersley, who hunger for expression through visual imagery. <BR><BR>It’s been 40 years since my family left the Philippines. Sometimes I am overwhelmed by the immense inequities between rich and poor that exist there.  I want to help bridge that chasm with photography — an innately democratic art form that can change the way we see our lives. <BR><BR>I’ve taught Hersley technique and execution. He knows F stops, shutter speeds, composition and light. He understands how the machine works. <BR><BR>This year, we talked about imagination and vision.  “I put my heart into every picture I take,” Hersley told me. “It’s about passion — the challenge to freeze moments in time.  That slice of reality probably won’t happen again. And that’s the image I want to share.” <BR><BR>Pleased by the eager response of the students and the results they have produced, the University scraped together funds to supplement the donated equipment with a pair of Canon Rebels. <BR><BR>Hersley’s photography is winning him recognition. He recently outshined 850 other photographers to gain free admission to an upcoming five-day photography gathering in Malaysia called CreativeAsia. <BR><BR>Meantime, he posts pictures on deviantart.com, and recently received inquiries from Stern, the German newsmagazine, about his images. <BR><BR>For now, Hersley is paying the favor forward with a series of summer workshops for Dumaguete’s youth. He teaches the basics, and hopes to find diamonds in the rough — like Alma Zosa Alcoran, whose work is included here.<BR><BR>Why take time off to teach photography to kids far away? I could be kicking back with a cold beer. But sometimes, the answers don’t always come from your head — but from your heart. My heart tells me that photography must survive as an important form of communication and understanding. <BR><BR>The photo gallery is a  cooperative project between me and a couple of talented young students. Dedicating vacation time to teach photography puts life in perspective, and helps bridge gaps in age, experience, and understanding. (Luis Sinco /LA Times) <BR><BR>",

Nehru Yurong. The launching was attended by Gov. Agustin Perdices, former Gov. Jose Petit Baldado, and FU President Mira Sinco.<BR><BR>Under the terms of the memorandum of agreement, the Municipality will encourage the participation of all barangays covered in the experiment, while the FUAAI will ensure the<BR>participation of FU alumni in monitoring the project's progress.<BR><BR>In his speech, Governor Perdices hailed the Manjuyod experiment as timely and relevant to the food security program of the Province. He said he felt happy in the significant community involvement it would generate as it is to be implemented in the barangays all over the Province.<BR><BR>Thirdly, he added, it would be Negros Oriental's contribution to the globalwide waste management effort. Saving the waste for the mechanical goat, instead of burning it, also contributes to the reduction of carbon emission.<BR><BR>In anticipation on the use of BMG-made fertilizer in all the 555 provincial barangays, the Governor inquired as to the reliability of the fertilizer quality-wise.<BR><BR>FU officials assured him it is better and much cheaper than commercial fertilizer.<BR><BR>For his part, former Governor Baldado expressed hope the Manjuyod experiment will<BR>become the center of organic fertilizer production not only for the Province but for the<BR>Visayas region as well. The propagation of the innovation is expected to gain momentum with the participation of the Manjuyod National Agricultural High School. Students led by school principal Lemuel Anfone, who were actively participating in the lecture held by the FU faculty and staff on the proper and actual use of the BMG.<BR><BR>The students' parents are expected to take an active role in utilizing the BMG in all  the town's barangays.<BR><BR>For a man who had watched Foundation University grow with the community, Baldado said he couldn't help but comment on its rapid improvements both on campus and in the<BR>University's outreach programs.<BR><BR>\"FU used to be a school that was not that prestigious but now, FU is different. It has greatly improved,\" Baldado said.<BR><BR>FU School of Industrial Engineering & Technology Dean Marlon Tanilon said one BMG will produce one fourth sack of fertilizer in three weeks. For one BMG, a farmer will earn about<BR>P50.00 in three weeks from rubbish and waste materials.<BR><BR>The fertilizer produced, which is even better than commercial fertilizer, also costs much less.<BR>With BMG, FU Agriculture Dean Mark Espedilla chimed in that composting is sped up four<BR>times over.<BR><BR>Composting waste materials on an open pit will take one year while regular composting that involves using the BMG takes about three weeks.<BR><BR>The waste material inside the BMG is turned a few times each morning to hasten the conversion of the waste materials into fertilizer.<BR><BR>Dr. Aparicio Mequi, dean of the FU Graduate School and coordinator for the university's environment program, said the Manjuyod experiment is off to a good start. \"The dedication of our public officials in waking up very early just to be in Manjuyod for the turnover<BR>ceremony was a good sign.<BR><BR>It shows that our top provincial officials are interested to see the project through to a successful beginning.\" (Romeo G. Capilitan)<BR>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>olgaluciauy@yahoo.com<BR><BR><BR>I don’t like her!”  This was my 10-year old’s pronouncement 30 minutes into Master Class, a play based on the series of master classes given by legendary opera singer Maria Callas at the Julliard School of Music in New York City in 1971 and 1972.<BR><BR>I must say that I agree with my daughter’s observation.  Arrogant, insulting, dismissive, condescending, haughty, difficult, impatient ... are but a few of the words that I could think of to describe this diva.  She spoke her mind at will, and with a wave of her aristocratic hand, trampled on people’s emotions as if they were dirt under her feet.  Yes, she wasn’t likeable at all.  <BR><BR>But likeable or not, Maria Callas must have been an awesome human being.  And this very quality, this essence that was Maria Callas, was brought to us by Ms. Cherie Gil with such clarity and intensity that left us reeling.  That was some emotional roller coaster ride Ms. Gil made us go through.<BR><BR>Ms. Cherie Gil was Cherie Gil when we first met her during the press conference.  But the person who came to the stage was Maria Callas, a formidable woman who, with the slightest tilt of her chin, made it clear to us that we mere mortals being graced with the presence of a goddess.  From that point on, we were not seeing Ms. Gil.  We had Maria Callas before us. <BR><BR>At the beginning, we hated her with as much fervor as her “victims”, as she called them, must have hated La Divina herself.  We laughed at her wicked humor and we sat in awe as we witnessed her live her art and delve into the passion of the characters she played in the opera.  <BR><BR>But something unexpected happened towards the end.  We stopped hating Maria Callas.  And this was where Ms. Gil’s acting genius came to full force.  She revealed to us a Maria Callas who was just as human as we all are ... she was lonely and she wanted to love and be loved just like any one of us. We cried for her as she gave up her unborn child for the love of a man who treated her with as much disdain as she treated those around her.  And we held our breath as, letting go of every bit of pride she ever possessed, she begged and pleaded for him to marry her. She did not want to be alone.  But it was all in vain.  The love of her life chose another woman over her.  We felt her pain. We felt her despair.  Ms. Gil made us feel all that.<BR><BR>Ms. Gil as a consummate actress came to be as Maria Callas.  The bratty Lavinia who hissed, “You’re nothing but a second-rate, trying hard, copy cat!!!”  to a hapless Sharon Cuneta a long time ago is a far cry from the commanding figure we saw on stage, an aristocratic woman who could cower an entire auditorium into silence with a single look.  <BR><BR>Admittedly, that line has achieved an almost-legendary status and continues to tickle our fancy through the years.  Young children, including my 10-year old daughter, can deliver it with as much venom as Ms. Cherie Gil did in the movie Bituing Walang Ningning.   This is a richly-deserved honor for Ms. Gil.  But it’s time to move on.<BR><BR>Ms. Gil shouldn’t be known as Lavinia alone for she shone even brighter as Maria Callas.  Her strength as an actress has never before been laid out to an audience with as much intensity as it was in Master Class. <BR><BR>Forget that copy cat line.  Ms. Cherie Gil has outgrown Lavinia.  She is now Maria Callas, a woman, who without any shred of doubt in her being, could dismissively declare to the world: “How can I have rivals when no one can do what I can do?”<BR><BR>And those very same words could very well apply to Ms. Gil herself.  For who, indeed, can do what Cherie Gil can do?  Kudos to our favorite villainess.  Keep the passion.<BR><BR>",

She moves out.  She moves on.  She moves like the moon gliding through the ocean blue.  She moves like the sun dazzling the sky white. <br> <br>A dance is all about movement.  From the click-clack of the fingers to the rhythm of the beat, from the swaying of the hands to the sashaying of the hips and shoulders they all pulsate to breathe life to dancing feet.  <br><br>It is a movement in space, movement in time, and a movement in grace.  Movement personified.  In method acting, dance and dancer fuse into one.  Dance becomes Lucy.  Lucy Jumawan Sauer, crowned the 2010 Outstanding Silliman Awardee for Dance.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Moving in Time</span><br></div><br><br>        Moving back in time, she remembers how she got initiated to her passion, the mission, and the dance of her life. She got started with a motherly advice.  <br><br>Back in time, she was the little girl chasing butterflies in a meadow of Dauin.  It all began when she asked her mother for food. Food being scarce in a wanting family, mother told Lucy “to dance with the butterflies”.  <br><br>She went to the meadow and flitted after the fluttering butterflies. She tiptoed after the jumping grasshoppers as if to grab and eat them. She wandered. She wondered at the undulating body of the fish beneath the meadow stream.  <br><br>In a little while, Lucy forgot the pain and pangs of her hunger.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">     <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Moving in Space</span><br></div><br><br>        For Lucy, any place is a dance studio. In the meadows, her innate inclination grew. From the meadows in Dauin, she went to Dumaguete to study and learn the formal discipline of dancing. From thereon, Lucy’s passion for dance had taken her from Dumaguete to a lot of prominent places all over the World.  <br><br>At 17, she established the Lucy Patrimonio Dance Studio here in Dumaguete mainly to teach ballet to young aspiring students. She later became the directress of the Dance Department at the School of Music in Silliman University.  <br><br>In these ventures, she was able to produce dancers who became members of the world renowned Bayanihan Dancers of the Philippines.  Her effort was recognized when the First Lady Mrs. Imelda Marcos presented her a plaque of appreciation for pioneering classical ballet in the Visayas in 1976. Received also the Immigrant of the Year citation from SBS in Sydney.<br><br>Her interest in dance went beyond the classical ballet genre. She studied American primitive dances in Massassuchetts, USA.  Did research on Suban-on Muslim tribal dances in Mindanao.  Worked for the bridging of Native Australia to Asian dances in Sydney after immersing herself in Black Theatre.  And taught contemporary dance in Bangkok.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Moving in Grace</span><br></div><br><br>        Body movement can’t lie.  It’s the language of the heart.  It communicates the range of human emotion, which the dancer likes to explore. To experience the emotion she projects.  <br><br>This spark of curiosity is what led contemporary dance pioneers like Isadora Duncan to break away from the formal discipline and stricture of classical ballet. <br><br>Lucy fully subscribes to the idea and breakaway movement without losing the traditional dance values.  Isadora-like, she adapts some of time the pioneer’s fetish of wearing a flowing silken scarf over the shoulders to underscore graceful body movement.<br><br>Lucy learned and taught ballet in Dumaguete.  She pirouetted the Swan Lakeand The Nutcracker at the Cultural Center of the Philippines in Manila with Alexandra Danilova, then one of the world’s four most renowned prima ballerinas.  <br><br>She graced her way to the Opera House in Sydney in front of Australia’s number one then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.  And choreographed Australian Aborigine dances in Paris.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Moving Spirit</span><br></div><br><br>        She moves in time. She moves in space. The Spirit moves her. Lucy is living in accord to the will of the Heavenly Father.  She declares, “He is the Choreographer for us all.” <br> <br>God choreographs the respective, unique and intertwining dances of our lives.<br><br>That’s why she’s ticking with a grateful heart. Thanks the people who have profound influences in her formative years like music director Mimi Palmore and piano virtuoso Prof. Albert Faurot. Thanks Silliman University for instilling in her the pursuit of excellence that remains a constant guide in resolve to perfect her chosen Art. She thanks God for her late husband Max Jumawan who stood by her side. Max stood by her side when she formed the Silliman Dance Troupe in Dumaguete and oversaw the Aborigine Theatre Arts in Sydney. She is grateful for Walter Sauer who is now standing by her side. She is eternally grateful for her life’s entire blessing.  <br><br>Lucy is homecoming to her Alma Mater. Not solely to receive the accolade, but also to give back what she has taken. Hoping to establish a Dance Company to teach the art as a vehicle for discipline, even as a means of national discipline. Has faith in the Filipino when it comes to dancing. Asserts Pinoys have the edge in body movement over all other races.  Believes keeping in touch with the dance fashion will move the Filipino nation forward.<br><br>To establish an SU Dance Company is the new dream in her late years.  Walter commits to stand by her side. Her former students like Mariant Escano-Villegas, Pamela Teves, and the Serion sisters are behind her.  The Sydney-siders like Dodo Lado, Toto Garcia, and Alice Dumlao are with her all the way from Sydney.  Perhaps, the entire Silliman community spread all over the world will watch with keen interest for the realization of this dream. <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">         <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Moving on</span><br></div><br><br>        Once there was a girl who danced with butterflies in the meadow. She grew to be a woman with dancing feet. Then she pirouetted into a corridor of dancing halls from Dumaguete to Manila, from Sydney to Paris and Bangkok. From acclaim to accolade, she is dancing on. Even after receiving her latest diadem as Silliman’s prima ballerina, she is moving on. <br><br>Like a river, the dance motion flows.  Lucy lives via, veritas, vita.  Dancing is her way, her truth, and her life.   She dances to soar on eagle’s wings.  Like poetry in motion, she lingers on to touch the soul. Nevertheless as she learns from Silliman it is all about Him, still. The Silliman spirit is burning within her heart. Lucy, the instrument of her Choreographer’s will.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Leopoldo Cabanag Jr. where he emphasized on peace and order.<BR>  <BR>He noted that more than 90 percent of resolved crimes can be attributed to the cooperation of concerned civilians. Therefore, he said, there is a great need for more civilian intelligence to be deployed in the 30 barangays of the City. <BR> <BR>He further said that in order for the PNP-Dumaguete to be effective  in their peace-keeping efforts and to speed up their response to solving crimes, there must be a sustainable and reliable Intelligence network in the system.<BR><BR>In this connection,  the City Mayor said he is bent on deploying at least two Intelligence personnel in each barangay, totaling 60 Intelligence experts to be added to the PNP force.<BR><BR>Once again, the Mayor Sagarbarria lauded the PNP (Task Force 24) for the arrest of a certain Clyde Estocado for violation of Republic Act 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.<BR><BR>The arrest took place during the raid conducted by Task Force 24 on Sunday, Aug.22 at 2:00 p.m. along Looc Bypass Road.<BR><BR>The Mayor added that the five pillars of the criminal justice system which is composed of  1) law enforcement, 2) prosecution, 3) the courts, 4) correctional, and 5) the community must be well coordinated to achieve the people’s dream of a peaceful Dumaguete, paving the way for a better and sustainable economy, and for the industry to flourish so that the City can provide real opportunities to our constituents. <BR>                                            <BR>The City Mayor said he envisions a peaceful, orderly, and clean public market, one that could surpass among other cities in the Philippines, such that it could be one of the City’s tourist attractions.<BR><BR>He also convened all Public Market Task Force headed by Engr. Jose Ronnie Fortin and discussed with them a) the Task Force’ duties and responsibilities in keeping the cleanest and orderly public market,  b) implementing market rules and regulations without harshness and force,  c) and being present at all times in their respective posts.<BR><BR>The City Mayor added that all comfort rooms within the public market must be clean at all times.<BR><BR>Having all these concerns, the City Mayor stressed that making Dumaguete City a better place to live is everybody’s goal, and that everyone must do his share.<BR><BR>",

   "url": "pregnant-students-p470-104.htm",
   "body": "<BR><BR>In his column on \"Unitown and Teen Pregnancy\", Dr. Perry Mecqui quoted a study whose findings struck me as odd.  I wonder if anyone else noticed?<BR><BR>From Dr. Mecqui's article: \"In the Philippines, a study conducted by the UP Population Institute and the Demographic Research Foudnation in 2002 showed that 26 percent of Filipino youth, ages 15 to 25, admitted to have had premarital sex, and that 38 percent are in a living-in arrangement.\"<BR><BR>I don't quite know how to interpret that.  Taking the statement at face value, I would conclude that 12 percent of Filipino youth who are living in together are NOT having premarital sex.  Frankly, I think it's kind of incredible: do they mean to say that they're really just playing house?  If so, the researchers missed the opportunity to ask the respondents the secret to their abstinence.<BR><BR>In the interest of due diligence, I searched the Internet for the original study.  I turned up several references in the popular media, and they all quote the same thing that Dr. Mecqui does.  Of the original study itself, I found nothing.  Oh, well.<BR><BR>Dr. Mecqui also quotes another article, \"Unwed, pregnant -- and kicked out\", written by Rachel C. Balawid.  According to the article, the blame for the teenaged mothers' failure to rebuild their lives rests on the \"long-time policy of most Catholic schools...which consists of granting a leave of absence, or outright expulsion.\"  <BR><BR>And yet, the girls in the three stories that Dr. Mecqui presents all come from Foundation University which is not a Catholic school. Did the university force them to go on leave?  Did the university expel them?  I should hope not.<BR><BR>This is not what I've seen at Ateneo de Davao University which, by the way, is a Catholic school.   Now, I know I'm treading on sensitive ground here -- I took up some units in English with undergraduate students two years ago, and now I teach full time at the school -- but I think we need to balance out the picture with instances when unwed teenage mothers did manage to continue their studies...in a Catholic school.<BR><BR>I personally know of two instances, one a classmate in English, and the other  a former student. Their situations are so similar as to be practically indistinguishable.  The pattern went thus: frequent absences and missed assignments, but other than that no noticeable indicators.  Then they would disappear for a semester or two but eventually they come back and proceed with their studies.<BR><BR>If I found out, it was because I would remark to one of their classmates: \"It's good to see so-and-so back, I haven't seen her in a while.\"  And the response: \"Didn't you know?  She gave birth!\"  Fortunately, the instances of teen pregnancy that I personally know of are rare, compared with the population of the student body that I have come in contact with.  In any case, I am naturally oblivious to matters such as this.<BR><BR>On the other hand, I'm not so oblivious as to be blind.  If I didn't find out about these students' pregnancies, it's because pregnancy is not so very readily obvious.  The bulge starts to show at three to four months, but for some women it can take as long as six.  To their credit, none of the girls' classmates ever bothered to mention it to me (because it was none of my business); and the normally-tough teacher who did know about my classmate's pregnancy actually went very easy on her.<BR><BR>Yet they still had to go on leave!  So terrible of the big bad Catholic school, right?  But of course they had to go on leave!  They were pregnant!  They were going to give birth!  If expecting working women go on maternity leave, shouldn't expecting students get to do the same?  In the Philippines, maternity leave is 60 days; if you knew you would be out for two months out of five in a semester, do you think it would be prudent to enrol?<BR><BR>What matters in the end was that, in the case of these two women whom I know, they were able to continue with their studies.  Did the big bad Catholic school pose any obstacle to their return?  No.  If these women had been studying in Foundation University, would they have been expelled?  I don't know (but I suspect an official answer will be forthcoming). What made for the difference between women in the stories presented by Dr. Mecqui and the women in mine?  If I had to hazard a guess, I would think it would be their supportive families and communities.<BR><BR>",

   "body": "<BR>The dictionary defines trivia as “matters or things that are very unimportant, inconsequential, or inessential; trifles.” So, read on and just enjoy this piece.<BR><BR>Silliman University holds the distinction of being the first in the Philippines to offer coed boxing in its collegiate physical education program. I searched the internet for any other institution in any part of the globe that offers coed boxing, but found none.<BR><BR>Women's boxing, first came to prominence in England in 1720 and appeared as a demonstration sport at the 1904 Olympics. However, there was no attempt to bring it back into the Olympics and the  IOC rejected its inclusion in the 2008 Olympics “over concerns about medical safety and low participation worldwide.” <BR><BR>The London Olympic Games in 2012 will allow female boxers to compete for the first time. Last August 2009 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decreed that 36 places would be available in London to the world’s elite female fighters, who would compete across three weight classes: flyweight (48-51kg), lightweight (56-60kg) and middleweight (69-75kg).<BR><BR>In London, there will be 12 slots available for each of the three women’s divisions, making a total of 36 fighters. To make room for the female boxers, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) scaled down the men’s divisions from 11 to 10, removing the 48-kilogram lightflyweight category from where the Philippines has collected a silver and two bronzes. <BR><BR>The Women’s International Boxing Federation was formed in 1993 by woman boxing legend Barbara Buttrick. \"Battling\" Barbara Buttrick (born 1930) was a world champion in women's boxing in the 1940s and 1950s. Born in England, Buttrick is considered a pioneer of women's professional boxing. Known as \"The Mighty Atom of the Ring\", Buttrick, at 4&#8242; 11&#8243;, fought from 98 lbs. to being the World’s unbeaten flyweight (112) and bantamweight (118) champion from 1950 to 1960. Buttrick allegedly fought many exhibition bouts against male opposition. She retired from boxing in 1960. (Wikipedia)<BR>On February 9, 2006 the Games and Amusements Board (GAB), the government’s regulatory body for professional sports, unanimously voted to conduct women’s professional boxing in the Philippines. <BR>Gretchen “Chen-Chen” Abaniel of Puerto Princesa City, Palawan is the current WIBA or Women's International Boxing Association minimum weight champion. She successfully defended her title last March against Fahpratan Looksaikongdin of Thailand.<BR><BR>Last June 30, 2010, a Filipina, Ana “The Hurricane” Julaton, won the Super Bantamweight Championship of the World Boxing Organization (WBO), in Ontario, Canada by a split decision over Maria Elena Villalobos of Mexico. <BR><BR>Mitchel Martinez was the first world-class female boxer produced by the Amateur Boxing Association of the Philippines (ABAP). She won gold medals at the Southeast Asian and Asian level and two bronze medals in the World Championships. She retired recently and joined the ABAP coaching staff.<BR><BR>The name Annie Albania became synonymous with Philippine women’s amateur boxing since that day when Freddie Roach singled her out as the amateur boxer that really impressed him. This was when Roach was in Baguio training Manny Pacquiao for Miguel Cotto and saw the amateur fighters in action. Roach told the Philippine sports press corps that the female boxers were “better than the boys.” Albania lived up to the hype when she won a SEA games gold and another gold medal at the 2009 Asian Indoor Games. <BR><BR>Recent Manila visitor Nieva Tesoro Embuldeniya, vice president of the AIBA (Association Internationale de Boxe) Women’s Commission and the only AIBA female executive committee member, said she expects Asian countries to show the way in the race for medals in the London Olympiad. Embuldeniya, who is based in Sri Lanka with her husband and former AIBA executive committee member Herbert, said Asian countries which are unsuccessful in winning an Olympic gold in men’s boxing are now turning their attention to female fighters as potential medal winners. The Philippines and Sri Lanka are prime examples.<BR><BR>At the fifth World Women’s Boxing Championships in Ningbo City two years ago, host China topped the medal standings with five golds, two silvers and four bronzes. Three Asian countries finished in the top five among 17 of 42 participating countries that won medals. Aside from China, the others were fourth placer India and fifth placer North Korea. The Philippines tied with Sweden and the US with a silver and two bronzes for 10th place. Bantamweight Annie Albania took the silver while pinweight Josie Gabuco and lightflyweight Analisa Cruz settled for bronzes for the Philippines. <BR><BR>In 2001, Laila Ali, the daughter of “The Greatest” Muhammad Ali, fought Jacqui Frazier-Lyde, the daughter of “Smoking” Joe Frazier, in a continuation of an old feud billed as Ali-Frazier IV. In a exciting showdown that drew a lot of media coverage, Laila won a majority decision. She would go on to win multiple titles at supermiddleweight and light heavyweight in an eight year career.<BR>Steve Acunto, who served on the New York State Athletic Commission for 49 years, proclaimed that boxing is a manly science and art. In 1995 he taught the only accredited boxing course in the USA at Westchester Community College. He said that women signed up for his class and were entering the ring. Acunto who fought as a professional in the 1940’s declared that he does not think women should box. <BR><BR>Cuba has the best amateur boxing program in the world. That's because they've done the hard work of building up a top-flight program, and also because its best boxers are forbidden from leaving the country and has to defect under cover of darkness if they want to turn professional. After Olympic officials announced the addition of women's boxing to the lineup --Cuban officials have announced that they will not be fielding a team. \"We have no plans at the moment to participate in any international events because we don't think the sport is appropriate for women,\" Jose Barrientos, president of Cuba’s boxing association, said as reported by Cuba's official news service, Prensa Latina. Cuban head boxing trainer Pedro Roque told Cuban radio that while he recognized that the discipline was under development for women elsewhere, Cuban women \"are made for beauty and not to take blows around the head.\"<BR>In Nov 1996, Dr. Adrian Whiteson, chief medical adviser to the British Boxing Board of Control, said: \"I’m terribly concerned about this. I don’t think enough is known about the potential risks to women for such a decision (allow women boxing) to be made.  Blows around the breast or chest can induce bruising, and the nodule which is created is difficult to distinguish from cancer.<BR>After the death of a male fighter in October of 1997, the Federazioni Pugilistica Italiana outlawed female boxing entirely. They even stopped a televised WIBF flyweight fight that was to be in Milan to enforce this ban. <BR><BR>The Vatican newspaper L’Oservatore Romano in an editorial said: “The basic argument (against boxing) is a moral one, the question always the same: Is it legitimate to continue to accept a sport whose fundamental aim if to ‘inflict corporal damage to the adversary,’ as the World Medical Assembly held in Venice some months ago defined it? Physicians are in their majority of one mind in responding that it is neither legitimate nor moral. But opposition is manifold…Nonetheless, boxing remains a violent sport, if not in the intention of the contestants at least in its form of expression…No sporting discipline nor any king of ‘show’ can be accepted by a civic conscience if it endangers human life. Much worthier causes call for putting live at stake.”<BR><BR>Dr. George Lundberg, editor of the JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association wrote: “The scientific articles that we have  published in our journal, plus those in other journals, have become general medical knowledge now, and these articles indicate that chronic brain damage is a very frequent occurrence among fighters who’ve had a significant number of fights.”<BR>The Amateur Boxing Association of the Philippines and the Philippine Olympic Committee believe that our country’s first Olympic gold medal will be won by a Filipina boxer in the 2012 London Olympics. Basketball association President Manny Pangilinan promises a P3 million cash prize for the Maria Clara who will bring home the gold medal. <BR><BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>This is a boy with a motorcycle near a native house by the sea.<BR>The motorcycle is a small Honda, a common type seen all over the country and in many other Asian countries as well, basic transportation. It’s not very fast or powerful, but it can be decked out with shiny exhaust pipes loud enough to attract attention to its owner, and annoy everyone else. <BR><BR>The house does not belong to the boy; he’s just visiting. The motorcycle doesn’t really belong to him either; he has it on a payment plan from the dealer, who holds the title. In fact he’s months behind on his payments, and has  just been served notice that the motorcycle will be repossessed if he doesn’t come up with the money by the end of the month. That’s why he looks so sad and upset.<BR><BR>The motorcycle means everything to him: his service to his sisters, the respect of his friends, the smiles of the girls he passes along the streets. It is his freedom and independence. Without his bike he would feel like a marathon runner in a wheelchair. He’s desperately trying to think of some way to come up with the money in time; he’ll do almost anything to get it.<BR><BR>That’s why it’s nice to be a motorcycle dealer. A motorcycle is an emotional  necessity for your customers; most of them cannot pay cash and go on payment plans; they often wind up paying you more than double the purchase price with interest charges; they would rather go hungry than let you repossess; but if they finally default, you can take back the bike, clean it up and sell it again.<BR><BR>But of course the dealers are not demons, just business men. And their customers are certainly not angels either. Many will use fake ID’s and  fake references and lie about everything on their credit applications; some will even will wreck and ruin the bikes they financed and make their dealers search for the remains, while they laugh and disappear somewhere without payment. <BR><BR>This boy hasn’t done any of those things, and he probably won’t. He just wants to keep his bike, and doesn’t have the money he needs. But he’ll probably find a way to get it; if he doesn’t, and loses the bike, he will, eventually, find a way to get another one.  And so the dance goes on.<BR><BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport9-5-10.jpg\"><BR><BR>",

   "url": "learning-from-kenya-p473-98.htm",
   "body": "<BR><BR>One of the benefits of traveling abroad is the opportunity to learn lessons from experts of other countries. On August 21 through September 3, 2010, I served as member of the Group of Experts for Asia for the United Nations Program for the Review  of Assessments of the State of the Marine Environment meeting in the United Nations main office in New York City. Our group of more than 20 members met with the Ad Hoc Working Group of the Whole to the 65th session of the UN General Assembly. One of the members of the Expert Group  was Dr. Renison Ruwa, Deputy Director of the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute at Mombasa, Kenya. He and I have common interest in marine protected areas. Here I write about  lessons in coastal resource management that may be of interest to our people.<BR><BR>Kenya, as we already know, has unique terrestrial biodiversity, such as large species of mammals not found in the Philippines. However, the marine biodiversity has many species in common, especially fish and marine invertebrates. One of the marine ecosystems common to both countries is the coral reef.<BR><BR>In terms of human populations, Kenya has 40 million and the Philippines 90+ million. About 10% of Kenya's population occupy coastal areas. In the Philippines, an archipelago, about 60-80% of the people live in coastal areas within 50 km from the shoreline. Both Kenyans and Filipinos  are dependent on coastal and marine resources. <BR><BR>Because of the differences in the proportion of coastal populations to the total populations (10% versus 60-80%), it would appear that the Philippine coastal ecosystems are subjected to a relatively greater degree of exploitation pressure compared to Kenyan ecosystems. The Philippines should be concerned with this situation.<BR>According to Dr. Ruwa, about 60% of coral reef areas in Kenya are marine parks that are totally protected by armed guards, leaving a smaller proportion (40%) for fishing by the people. In fact, Kenyan fishermen are complaining about this arrangement.<BR><BR>In contrast, only less than 5% of the Philippine coral reef area are protected, not by armed guards but mostly by coastal communities. There is a lesson here that we can learn: Kenya appears to have done a better job at protecting their reefs. Of course, our reef system is more extensive than Kenya's, requiring more manpower and financial resources.<BR><BR>Tourism is a popular activity in both countries and both countries derive much income from tourists. In Kenya, very little of income from user fees goes to communities, but in the Philippines, as much as 75% go to the communities. In this regard, the Philippines has an edge over Kenya. But the drawback is that only few marine reserves in the Philippines are earning income from tourists. A lesson can be learned here: The national government and the local government units should promote more sustainable use of coastal areas for tourism purposes. To be able to do this, more marine reserves need to be established for sustainable development purposes, such as protect fisheries and bidiversity. To ensure success, dedicated and well trained teams should be hired to protect marine reserves, and not just by unpaid guards who volunteer their services.<BR><BR>Even though tourism is an income generating activity, we must not lose sight of the fact that the priority of Philippine marine protected areas in both Kenya and the Philippines is to conserve biodiversity to ensure high levels of fishery production now and in the future. This is because a certain critical density of any fish species is required to produce eggs and larvae that will replace the adults that are being continually fished by fishermen.  <BR>   <BR>For purposes of maintaining a high level of commitment on the part of those involved in marine protected areas, the Philippines needs to periodically invite experienced experts from other countries that have successful programs of protection of coastal and marine ecosystems and their resources. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

Did the neon lights also &#61441;t this Supreme Court ‘s &#61442;ip-&#61442;op-&#61442;ips on 16 towns that masqueraded as cities?<br><br>In a 7-6 decision, the Court this month whacked 16 cities back into towns. That reversed its December 2009 decision authorizing the 16 to fund city halls . But then that overturned a November 2008 ruling which declared the 16 cityhood laws unconstitutional.<br><br>Got that? No? <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hindi ka nagi-isa.</span> Consider this judicial zig-zag one “zag” at a time. Start with the latest “zig”, as Inquirer reported: “SC: It’s a &#61441;nal no to 16 new cities.”<br><br>“With two justices abstaining, the Supreme Court reversed itself anew in the controversial case of 16 cityhood laws. This time, (the Court) reinstated its 2008 decision that declared these laws unconstitutional.”<br><br>Antonio Carpio is arguably the best Supreme Court chief justice we never had. The Constitution “expressly provides that no city shall be created except in accordance with the criteria established in the local government code,” Justice Carpio writes in this new decision.<br><br>“Clearly, the cityhood laws contravene the letter and intent of … the Constitution,” it adds. Congress, in fact, “exceeded and abused its law-making power.”<br><br>Justices Conchita Carpio-Morales, Arturo Brion, Diosdado Peralta, Martin Villarama Jr. and Jose Mendoza concurred. So did mint-new justice Maria Lourdes Sereno.<br><br>The clobbered 16 are: Baybay, Leyte; Bogo, Naga and Carcar in Cebu; Catbalogan, Samar; Tandag, Surigao del Sur; Lamitan, Basilan; Borongan, Samar; Tayabas, Quezon; Tabuk, Kalinga; Bayugan, Agusan del Sur; Batac, Ilocos Norte; Mati in Davao Oriental, plus Guihulngan in Negros Oriental.<br><br>The 16 opted for <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">palusot</span>. They badgered the 14th Congress to exempt them from a task borne by others, i.e. to generate P100 million in local income. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo winked at this cushy shortcut via exemptions by letting the 16 bills lapse into law.<br><br>The Court shredded a motion for reconsideration by the 16. By a 7-5 vote in March 2009, the Court slammed the door shut “with finality for lack of merit”. Following Entry of Judgment , the Court added: “No further pleadings shall be entertained.”<br><br>“We are not &#61441; nal because we are infallible,” Justice Robert Jackson wrote of the US Supreme Court. “But(we are) infallible only because we are &#61441;nal.”<br><br>In the Arroyo Court, alas, “‘final’ does not mean de&#61441;nitive, decisive, conclusive, unchangeable or unappealable,” <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sun Star</span> noted. It can also mean “changeable, inconclusive or revocable.”<br><br>Thus, the Court made a U-turn on Dec. 21 last year. Prohibited pleadings were entertained. And what lacked merit morphed into the meritorious. Read Justice Presbitero Velasco’s reversal ponencia.<br><br>A whiff of scandal surfaced. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Inquirer</span>’s editorial <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dear Justice</span> revealed that the 16 “cities” counsel Estelito Mendoza wrote a “For-Your-Eyes-Only” letter” to justices. In January 2009, Mendoza asked: Justices who didn’t participate in deliberations be allowed to vote anyway. “Mendoza did not deny the existence of the letters,” <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Inquirer </span>added. “It is clear… they tried to pull a fast one over us.”<br><br>“Unethical”, erupted League of Cities vice chair Paulino Salvador Leachon. “This is completely against the law—to write the court seeking a favorable decision,” the Calapan mayor added…”We were not provided with those secret documents.”<br><br>Today, the 16 must paint over city hall signs and shed new hire. They must yank their hands out from Internal Revenue Allotment of 121 other cities.<br><br>That “sweat-free” cash spurred the stampede to clone cities. In 1991, there were 60 cities. Many were of dubious viability. The total soared to 131 in June 2007.<br><br>Shell cities “strained national government’s ability to finance these units,” World and Asian Development Banks warned as early as 2000. “The small size of LGUs prevent them from generating their own revenues .”<br><br>Justice Velasco Jr. dissented -- as expected. He found the decision “rather startling“. Returning the Court to constitutional moorings is indeed startling. Now, will the Court start breaking free of the Sysiphus syndrome: “A perpetual circuit of never &#61441;nal litigations.”?<br><br>In the realm of the dead, Sisyphus was sentenced to roll a huge stone up a steep hill, Greek mythology tells us. There was an eternal handcuff. On reaching the summit, the stone would skid to the bottom.<br><br>The Carpio ponencia may have ended that syndrome insofar as the cities issue is concerned. What about equally jolting &#61442;ip-&#61442;ops, as in the Flight Attendants vs Philippine Airlines, to cite just one.<br><br>The new decision, meanwhile, scuttled plans of congressmen to send 27 more towns hurtling down ‘Exemption Highway” to become cities. It reinforces the Court decision to scrub Dinagat Island as the 81st province.<br><br>After a plebiscite, Dinagat had been proclaimed and of&#61441;cials appointed, then Gov. Geraldine Ecleo-Villaroman argued. The island’s failure to meet criteria of land area, population, and income “was irrelevant”.<br><br>This proposition is “fraught with mischief … and creates a dangerous precedent,” snapped Justice Peralta. The Court would “not passively accept a fait accompli for an illegal province…. The error should not provide the very excuse for perpetuation of such wrong…The Court should interpret and indicate what the law is and should be.”<br><br>Say that again, Your Honors please. Just “once more -- with feeling”.<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>When our newly elected leaders assumed of&#61441;ce on July 1, 2010, most Filipinos were full of hope, but were weary of the possibility of the same governmental malaise, with promises unful&#61441;lled.<BR><BR>But, no one could have foreseen, the bloody, violent end of the August 23, 2010, hostage crisis and all because of INCOMPETENCE. On hindsight, a review of the sequence of events, based on the facts at hand, will show that INCOMPETENCE, was the main reason why the outcome, was a global &#61441;asco for the Philippine government.<BR><BR>Consider the following points:<BR><BR>1. The hostage taker was a dismissed in 2009, due to extortion, commonly referred to as “HULIDAP”, and gang rape, why was he not in jail, or at least, in some form of limitation of movement-house arrest or kept in the barracks, or under the supervision and custody of a superior of&#61441;cer?<BR><BR>2. The hostage taker DID NOT SURRENDER HIS UNIFORM AND FIREARMS, after being dismissed;<BR><BR>3. The hostage taker was in uniform and fully armed, brandishing high powered &#61441;rearms, walking around Fort Santiago where tourist abound, where were the tourists police in the area?<BR><BR>4. The fully armed hostage taker was able to board a tourist bus, why was this allowed?<BR><BR>5. That upon notice to authorities, the team which responded were the colleagues of the hostage taker in the Manila Police Department, so, this is one of the probable reasons why they were hesitant to take him out, when they had many opportunities to do so;<BR><BR>6. The brother of the hostage taker and other family members, were able to approach the bus and meddle with the negotiations;<BR><BR>7. There was no crowd control, as well as media management of the whole episode;<BR><BR>8 . The unit that responded showed lack of equipment, skills, and showed hesitation, lack of determination to make use of the element of surprise in taking over the situation;<BR><BR>9. The hostage taker gave a deadline of 3:00p.m., and the responding team did not even have any idea on how to enter the bus, when it had exits on the right side, and on the &#61442;oor of the bus or the proper equipment to effect a quick entry;<BR><BR>10. There was no proper debriefing of those who were freed from the bus, to determine position, disposition of the hostages, and to meet their needs for water and other necessities, and employ means to divert the attention of the hostage taker;<BR><BR>11. That the crowd rushed to the crime scene after the shooting, with no provisions to keep the crime scene free from contamination;<BR><BR>There are still many other observations which can be gleaned from the incident- and to summarize, if there was only one ef&#61441;cient of&#61441;cial, with COMPETENCE, to implement the laws, the rules, and the protocol on crisis management, a more positive outcome would have been guaranteed.<BR><BR>In crisis management, the mantra is: “Expect the Worst but hope for the best” – the worst case scenario is embedded in any hostage scenario, only competent people can view the problem, in a wholistic manner.<BR><BR>No amount of blame game can reverse the outcome, but, it is sad and frustrating to note that because of INCOMPETENCE, those poor, helpless , tourists have to die. It is important to repeat the saying: “ONE MOMENT OF INDISCRETION, A LIFETIME OF REGRETS!” and to adapt and state it differently: “ONE MOMENT OF INCOMPETENCE , A WORLDWIDE NATIONAL SHAME!<BR><BR>With this incident, we hope that government will require full competence and integrity of all its officials and employees, especially those tasked with the maintenance of PEACE AND ORDER. And dispensation of Justice.<BR><BR>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>By Myrna Pena-Reyes<br><br>Loneliness shaped my father’s life, and circumstances deepened the loneliness  that accompanied him to the end.  Yet he accomplished his goals with a determination ever since, while still a child, he arrived at a singularity of purpose that would set him apart from the traditional path of his clan, farmers whose days were tuned to the rising and setting of the sun, planting and harvesting, courting and wedding, birthing and dying.<br> <br>By the time my father Alfredo Y. Reyes was born in 1907, the son of a farmer- <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cabeza de barangay</span> in Sinait, Ilocos Sur, the Americans had established an educational system that would educate the children of both rich and poor Filipinos.<br> <br>Alfredo loved school and learning and earned excellent grades.  When he and his boyhood companions would lie outdoors on moonlit nights sharing their dreams of the future, he didn’t let on what he wanted to be.  While the others talked of earning dollars on Hawaiian pineapple plantations, my father secretly nurtured his dream of becoming a teacher.  He admired his school teachers for their knowledge and fine clothes.<br> <br>But to become a teacher meant attending school beyond the seventh grade that  would impose great financial hardship on his family. To reveal his dream would elicit derisive laughter and ridicule from his friends.  So he guarded his secret.  He knew he could never be a farmer.  He chafed at the farm chores, and his family could not teach him how to plow.<br> <br>When he finished the seventh grade, one of his teachers strongly suggested to his father that he be allowed to continue his education “because Alfredo was an excellent student and not cut out for farm work.”  But Alfredo’s older brother thought his place was on the farm like all of them.  Still, their father must have felt proud and honored to have a son bright enough to pursue higher education.<br> <br>At the Vigan High School, Alfredo relished student life and excelled in algebra and science.  To stretch his funds, he developed sound habits in managing money and organizing his time, traits that would serve him well always.  All his life, he would live a life of strict discipline, but he would always be an anxious and lonely man.<br> <br>Though he was consistently in the brightest section of his class, a sadness tempered his life. At home, his older brother complained about his absence and questioned their father’s wisdom in sending him to high school. Alfredo’s guilt and sadness isolated him from his carefree peers.  While they made plans for college, he knew that that would be impossible for him because he wouldn’t allow himself to be a burden to his family again.  In fact, he determined never to be a bother to anyone, which would account for his pride in self-sufficiency and independence all his life.<br> <br>He was the first in his clan to finish high school.  College was made possible through a townsmate, Prof. Juan Campos, who taught botany at Silliman Institute.  He told Alfredo’s family about the work scholarship program at Silliman that covered tuition, board and lodging of needy deserving students. So arrangements were made for Alfredo to accompany him back to Dumaguete.  Alfredo’s older brother openly resented the plan.<br> <br>At Silliman, when Alfredo wrote home for additional funds, he learned how his older brother was making life difficult for their father.  The next year, Alfredo qualified as a lab assistant in botany, a job he would hold till graduation, showing his family that he could be on his own.  He was also put in charge of the Botanical Garden.  His success with plants was the only link he would keep to his farming heritage.<br> <br>He thrived at Silliman and would remember with humor his initial difficulty understanding the American accent of teachers like Dr. Robert Silliman, his history professor, and Dr. James Chapman, zoology professor.  But he would form a warm and close father-son friendship with Dr. Chapman who would help him get hired at Silliman later in life.<br> <br>Since he could not afford to go home, he stayed behind on campus during long school breaks.  From his dorm by the sea emptied of his dorm mates, he would watch the boats leaving the pier with other students headed home on vacation.<br> <br>But Mrs. Laura Hibbard, wife of then Silliman president Dr. David Hibbard, hired him to take care of their yard and plants, as well as their fat spoiled cat, when they went away on summer vacation.  Alfredo used his extra earnings for school supplies and clothes.  Like teachers and students then, he wore white <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Amerikana </span>and a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">korbata </span>to class.<br>  <br>When he had himself baptized as a Protestant, Alfredo embraced religion on a personal level.  For several days after his baptism, he was filled with a sense of euphoria that he took to be the power of the Holy Spirit.  From then on, his faith and his close relationship with God was a steadfast source of strength.  The wondrous mysteries of science that would occupy him all his life accommodated this abiding faith in a Supreme Intelligence who was benevolent and merciful.<br> <br>But he was a loner with very few friends.  Guarded and very private, he did not make friends easily.  Sometimes he would join activities of the Ilocano Students Organization where Elena de la Pena and her sister Petra were members.  The two were also in his botany class. Elena was warm and outgoing, as Alfredo was distant and fiercely private.  He may have noticed her, but she had a boyfriend.  Whenever she and her friends would visit the Botanical Garden, they couldn’t help noticing how hardworking and devoted to his job “Manong Fred” was. Their mutual friend, Ginesa “Gining” Gaoay-Heceta, asked him to sign her autograph book.  Decades later, she would show his children his message:  “I hope you won’t forget your friend, the loneliest of men.”<br><br>After graduation in 1931, Alfredo went home to see his family again after an absence of four years.  That was during the Depression, and he had to leave home once more to look for work and pursue his dream.   <br> <br>Mindanao, the “Land of Promise” beckoned with land available for homesteading.  But he wasn’t interested.  After several stints as a substitute teacher where he taught different subjects and struggled to make ends meet, he finally landed a full-time job teaching high school biology.   <br> <br>About this time, Alfredo’s path and Elena’s would cross again. Her closely-knit family in Cagayan, Misamis Oriental were impressed with the quiet, hard-working man and learned to respect his sense of privacy and fierce independence.  <br><br>After he and Elena wed, they settled in Cagayan where he taught high school and she, elementary school, and started a family.  My twin sister Lorna and I were followed two years later by a brother, Dion.  This was probably my father’s happiest time.  But it wouldn’t last, for my mother had to seek radiation treatment at the PGH in Manila for breast cancer.  In her absence, my father held the family together with the help of a loyal housemaid.  From school, he would rush home to take care of us.<br> <br>World War II would interrupt my mother’s treatment.  My sister and I had just turned three when our families fled to the mountains. For the duration of the war, we moved back and forth in the forests and jungle evading the Japanese.  My father could construct a hut from bamboo and cogon grass in no time; he made and laid out bamboo traps for fish, shrimps and crabs in rivers and streams, and knew what wild plants to gather for food.  <br> <br>But my mother weakened gradually.  Devotedly every day, my father would clean and dress the suppurating wound on her breast, braving its stench.  As children, we learned to be obedient and quiet.  <br> <br>Years later, he would tell us how my mother worried that she wouldn’t be around to help care for us.  She was especially concerned that we should go to college.  My father promised to give us a good education.  My sister and I were four when our mother was released from her suffering.  But life was a constant struggle.  Food was scarce, and we were always sick with malaria.  In a serious fall, my father broke his thigh while fleeing the Japanese, and he would always walk with a pronounced limp.<br>  <br>Because of his independence and need for privacy, our family would live separately from our relatives. Since we were still very young, he did all the work: gathering food and fetching water in a hollowed out bamboo tube, cooking, cleaning, washing clothes, bathing us at a communal spring. I remember watching him sometimes grinding corn on a stone <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">galingan </span>on the kitchen floor at night, a sad, solitary figure.  He was very resourceful, sometimes hiring himself out to harvest rice in exchange for a few gantas of rice; at other times he made <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lumpia </span>which he sold at the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">tabo-an</span> on Sundays. He was always working and had no close friends, but we were always together.  He showed us spiders spinning their webs, katydids and cicadas close up, birds’ nests, and taught us our ABCs which we practiced on the back of banana leaves, using pointed sticks for pencils.  <br> <br>At War’s end in 1945, we returned to Cagayan and started school a year later. Although our father left the public school system to become the first director (president) of Pilgrim Institute, a newly-founded Protestant high school in Cagayan, his dream was to have us educated at Silliman.  He figured that if we moved to Dumaguete, we could work our way later through college, as he did. Thus, when he was offered a job at Silliman on Dr. Chapman’s recommendation, our family moved to Dumaguete in 1950.  <br><br>We were aware that he always expected high grades of us. After elementary school and high school, as he had planned, my sister and I would become “work scholars” in college.  My brother would earn an athletic scholarship on the varsity soccer team.  When we all graduated from college, our father felt that he had finally fulfilled his promise to our mother.<br> <br>Professionally, he was a dedicated teacher and researcher, the botanist in the Biology Department which included Professors Dioscoro Rabor, Angel Alcala,  Rodolfo Gonzales, among others.  New species of army ants in Camp Lookout and marine algae (seaweeds) that he collected would be named after him.  He was included in the Directory of Selected Scholars and Researchers in Southeast Asia, and in 1993, the zoological garden in the Center for Tropical Conservation Studies (CENTROP) near the Silliman grandstand was inaugurated and named in his memory.  His contribution as a member of the Campus Beautification Committee is still evident around the Silliman campus. In this year’s Founders Day celebrations, he was honored as one of the University’s “Heritage Builders,” having worked at Silliman for twenty-nine years.<br> <br>In the early 1960s, my father’s older brother, who had objected so strongly to his pursuing higher education, sent his youngest child to stay with us here so that she could also attend college at Silliman.  In letters to my father, he expressed deep regret for the past and begged forgiveness.  My cousin would earn a BSE degree and had a successful teaching career here where she has made her home with her DumagueteÒo husband whom she met in college.<br> <br>A single parent before the term existed, my father never re-married.  He had been independent too long and didn’t want to complicate his life.  The sole ruler at home, he kept us in line with his strict discipline.  He would pass on to us his spirit of independence, sense of privacy, his work ethic and self-sufficiency, but most of all, his abiding faith in a higher power who guides our course in life.<br> <br>My father encouraged us to discover our full potential and be productive citizens. When we left home to pursue our own lives, he never complained that he would be left alone.  He had a full life after retirement, taking care of his fruit trees and renting out the extra rooms in the house to Silliman students.  He would keep attending campus activities, drawing strength and comfort from his spiritual life, and considered the Rev. Dr. Proceso Udarbe his best friend and confidant.<br> <br>When he died unexpectedly from pneumonia at 84 in 1991, none of us were around. But I’d like to think that, with God’s constant presence in his life, my father may not have felt so lonely after all.  A grateful Sillimanian, he had left instructions for the lump sum of his retirement to be given back to the school at his death to help fund scholarship programs.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

What is your life?  You are a mist that appears for a while and then vanishes.” – James 4:14</span><br><br>Early afternoon last Sunday, I received news from Manila that Em Silvino, a young man whose wedding I officiated almost two years ago, drowned during a family outing in Real, Quezon. It was Em’s 27th birthday.   Em’s condition was immediately declared serious.  He was already unconscious when his body was taken to shore.  After emergency interventions were administered in a nearby local hospital, Em was rushed Monday dawn to St. Luke’s Hospital and was immediately placed on intensive critical care.  <br><br>Em was first introduced to me by then fiancé, Rina Navarro, great granddaughter of the late Bishop Cipriano Navarro, one of the founding members of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP).  From that first meeting, I knew he was truly in love.  It did not surprise me when Em and Rina, after much prayer, decided to get married.  Together with Rev. Mina Navarro-Palomo, aunt of Rina and granddaughter of Bishop Navarro, I co-officiated their wedding on January 24, 2009 at UCCP-Cosmopolitan Church.  The Lord graciously granted their prayers for a child.  Zion Emmanuel was born December 2009 and was baptized 28 days before the drowning incident.<br><br>The doctors have already declared Em brain dead. Still, we --- his family, friends and prayer partners--- are hoping and praying for a miracle. Certainly, the odds are too great and the chances are very slim.  But you see,  in these kinds of situations, a miracle is the only thing that you can hold on to.  But while we are waiting in prayer, there is much to think and pray about for ourselves. It’s amazing how one incident can speak a thousand words to one’s spirit.  The lessons to learn are far too glaring. The insights to glean are profoundly  life-changing.   <br>     <br>Life is brief--- too brief than we can all understand or imagine.  In the words of James, we--- the complicated and convoluted creatures we call humans --- are simply mist.  We are here today, but so gone tomorrow.   In a flash of a second, our life can be snuffed out of us, and we cannot even bargain or complain.  This is why we all wonder, why we--- “mists”--- think so highly of ourselves.  Why do we have such lofty thoughts of our feats and exploits?  Why do we continue to live in our delusions that we are masters of our own destinies?  And why are we still fooling ourselves that God is not part of the equation we call life? <br>Renowned British physicist Stephen Hawking, speaking of his new book “The Grand  Design” which he co-authored with American physicist Leonard Mlodinow claims,  \"Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing. Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.\"  <br><br>Such statements send shivers down my spine. Certainly we are all entitled to our views.  But personally, I do not find value in using scientific jargons to exude a kind of profundity that challenges the very core of who I am, what I believe and what truly holds the whole world together.  When a young, promising and energetic husband and father who is in the threshold of  his career fights for his dear life--- and when the reality of exuberant hospital bills confront you or the inevitability of death stares at you squarely, it is absurd to think that it is not necessary to invoke God. <br> <br>These past days, I have become more grateful to the Lord for the gift of life--- for the blessing of being able to embrace my husband and hold my children close--- for being able to take each breath with unbelievable ease--- for being able to speak my mind ---- to go to places--- and to make a difference in the lives of people.  I am most grateful for the realization that we---  mere mists--- are unbelievably precious and of great worth in the eyes of God.  Indeed, we are here today and gone tomorrow.  But while we are still here today, may we find it in our hearts to be more cognizant of the purity and sincerity of Christ’s love --- to be more grateful  for what we have--- more appreciative of the family and friends who bring out the very best in us--- more attentive to what we are truly living for--- and more mindful of the truth that life is a gift--- a very wonderful  and prized gift that only God can give and take away. God bless you and be with you dearest Em!<br><br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

He said that Cebu, Bacolod, and other cities in the country have Soccer Football Team carrying the name of their respective cities, why can’t we have our own?<BR><BR>Funding such Sports activity seems to be the real problem, however the resourceful Mayor Sagarbarria was able to &#61441;nd possible source of fund, therefore, Dumaguete City Soccer Football Team is being eyed to be playing its role not only in the region but in the whole Philippines and maybe internationally carrying the banner of Dumaguete City, the city of Gentle People and the Academic community. The AIP, tagged as the Annual Investment Plan, will be the source of fund for this project.<BR><BR>Sensing that Dumaguete City is homed with soccer enthusiast, one of which is the City Mayor himself who, in his youth had passion for the said Sports. He strongly believed that Soccer Football players are just around the corner, ready to grab the opportunity and are willing to be trained for competence.<BR><BR>The City Mayor further stated that it was in the area of Sports that the World’s Boxing Champion and celebrity , now a representative of the lone district of Saranggani Province Manny “Pacman” Pacquiao came out as Brilliant Jewel.<BR><BR>The City Mayor’s enthusiasm of meeting with the World’s boxing champion Manny Pacquiao during his visit to Dumaguete City as guest speaker at Silliman University during its 109th Founding Anniversary was evident when he set a breakfast conference with the popular boxing champion at La Residencia along the Rizal Boulevard.<BR><BR>The breakfast conference was attended by some businessmen and prominent personalities and of course our very own 2nd district representative George P. Arnaiz as Manny’s tour guide.<BR><BR>The honorable Mayor Sagarbarria is hoping and assuring that Congressman Manny Pacquiao’s visit in Dumaguete City would encourange our young people to love Sports of any kind and get high on it instead of taking drugs that will destroy their lives and jeopardize their future.<BR><BR>",

   "body": "<BR>This boy and his little brother were just taking an afternoon nap one Sunday afternoon, and I was struck by the unthinking trust and devotion that was obvious between them. You often hear about brotherly love, and here it is, real and absolute.<BR><BR>Of course “Brotherly Love” is an abstraction, usually meant to encourage all human beings to love each other like brothers, but it’s difficult to imagine that as a actual reality. In this case, these two are brothers by blood, and in Dumaguete, blood counts for more than anything else. People love and are loyal to any relative down to their second and third cousins -- not for any good qualities they may have, but because they are tied to them, are actually a part of them, by blood and by upbringing.<BR><BR>They don’t even have to like them very much. But they will stand by them for better or worse; they will give them absolute priority over their most generous benefactor, their best friend, sometimes even over their wives and  husbands. For them to fail in this is disastrous. It brings not only guilt and shame, but actual loss of identity. If you’re not a part of your family here, you’re no one at all, not even to yourself.<BR><BR>But love and loyalty to anything but family is in short supply. Outside of  family, people’s feelings don’t run deep; with their friends, with their girlfriends and boyfriends, they just splash around like kids in a pool.  <BR><BR>They laugh and smile with each other, eat, drink, and even sleep with each other; but if in the middle of all this someone gets a call that his cousin has a problem, he’s gone- even if he leaves everyone else standing in the rain. Real love and loyalty does not extend to friends.<BR><BR>Nor does it extend to public welfare. When it comes to who makes the laws, who gets the city contract, family connections rule above even ordinary competence. If the person in question is a cousin, or even the friend of a cousin, he gets the support and the vote, no matter how unqualified he may be. The results are obvious.<BR><BR>This sleeping boy and his little brother dearly love each other. It’s certainly a good thing to love your family. But if you don’t love anything else in the world, you can’t expect much from it either.<BR><BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport9-12-10.jpg\"><BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>When a member of the family especially school age children are afflicted with   dengue, this is alarming and distressing   development.  Most parents would  be wrapped in serious anxiety and  emotional distress,  since medical management can only do so much, and there is no fool proof guarantee of the outcome.<BR>         <BR>Dengue is a mosquito borne disease,  and which  virulent  microorganism transmitted through bites,   attacks the  clotting mechanism of the  blood, reducing the platelet count. This is the most dreaded consequence, as internal bleeding  will result in shock, if not addressed timely and adequately.<BR>         <BR>This is the reason why the Department of Heath(DOH) officials should pay more attention to the dengue problem. Aside from the usual warnings, there has to be concerted effort and partnership between the health officials and the community, to   eliminate the source of the  problem. The recent outbreaks had distressed community resources, as the need for platelets, requires four(4) blood donors for each patient. The local Red Cross made the announcement of that their blood supply is stretched to the limit, and they have to have stores for other emergencies requiring full blood. Most LGUs have already conducted blood typing to have a list of possible donors, who are pre-qualified and pre-screened, for its constitutents.<BR><BR>        Public  and private hospitals have been filled beyond their usual capacity to accommodate dengue afflicted patients-young and old alike. <BR> <BR>At the risk of sounding ancient, some people are asking, if there are SANITARY INSPECTORS, in the plantilla positions  of DOH or the local government. The reason is that, in the past, SANITARY INSPECTOIRS would inspect all households, with regards to the cleanliness of the surroundings , proper disposal of garbage,etc. Each household can be located in each barangay through a spot map, at the  Rural Health Unit. With all the health alerts regarding dengue, there had been no mention of the sanitary inspectors. Are inspections conducted in the barangays? <BR>         <BR>The reason why the role of the Sanitary Inspectors had come into focus, is because, if one household cleans its environs and the neighbor does not, then, the dengue mosquito  will just transfer its  location, and  still endanger the whole neighborhood. In other countries like Singapore, sanitary inspectors can inspect even flower vases for the presence of  “kiti-kiti”, and impose the corresponding fine or penalty for anyone who has “kiti-kiti”, in his household. <BR>         <BR>Dengue carrying mosquitos bite from sunrise up to 9:00 a.m. and from 3:00p.m. to nighttime. But, can the DOH , LGUs and the community do more, in terms of prevention and stopping it at the source?<BR>        <BR>Dengue is a serious health problem, and there has to be more efforts done, to eliminate the problem.<BR>         <BR>Calling the attention of DOH, LGUs and barangay officials, please enact and implement  measures to address the dengue problem!<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

Locals were divided on whether to go to Bais City or to Dauin town, which were both celebrating their fiestas.<BR><BR>But in one room at the Silliman University Institute of Environment and Marine Sciences (IEMS),  some people ignored the social significance of that day to focus on an interesting event. Biology students from Foundation University were working hand in hand with renowned marine mammalogist  Louella Dolar and her staff in a project that involved the assembling of the female dolphin bones. These assembled dolphin bones will soon be hung on display at the Foundation University library.<BR><BR>But it doesn’t stop there for there’s more to it than meets the eye. The act by representatives of Silliman and Foundation Universities of assembling dry dolphin bones was actually giving flesh to a consortium entered into by the four universities in Dumaguete four years ago.<BR><BR>In signing the consortium,  the higher educational institutions represented by SU President Dr. Ben Malayang III, Negros Oriental State University President Dr. Henry Sojor, Foundation University Chairperson Victor Vicente Sinco, and St. Paul University of Dumaguete President Sr. Nilda Masirag agreed to share each other’s expertise in promoting common programs (sports, cultural, and academic) that will not only benefit Dumaguete City but Negros Oriental as well.<BR><BR>Last Friday’s simple activity was no less than historic in the intellectual development of our University Town.  It showed us all that there is more to Dumaguete than the competition towards academic excellence. Schools can actually sit down and work together for the common good.<BR>Through this consortium, students of our universities may be able to enhance their learning in a different environment, culture and discipline.<BR><BR>The generosity of Silliman University in sharing its resources and expertise with Foundation University should hopefully encourage all schools to think of ways to further cement linkages with each other.  They could also look beyond the members of the consortium and extend a hand to other educational institutions in need.<BR><BR>We remember the assistance given by St. Paul University in Dumaguete and Foundation University to the St. Francis High School in Vallehermoso, which was razed by fire over one year ago. Both schools donated chairs for that school’s more than 500 students. That simple gesture meant so much to the fire victims.  <BR><BR>Little things mean a lot. This is the Unitown concept at work.<BR>",

Anti-crime crusader Teresita Ang See slashed with that blade at the killing of eight Hong Kong tourists probe..<BR><BR>“You had the line (to hostage-taker Rolando Mendoza),” a furious Ang See told Radyo Mo Nationwide’s Michael Rogas and Jake Madarzo. . “But you didn’t bother to make an appeal to free them.” <BR><BR>“Ma’am Ang See was right,” Erwin Tulfo, TV5 chief correspondent told Justice Secretary Lila de Lima. Media tried to “out scoop” each other. The rat race was for ratings that ping cash registers, not save lives. Did the tourist hostage crisis morph into a “captive” of broadcast competition?<BR><BR>Among jostling broadcasters, Tulfo squeezed in a line to Mendoza ,. The bus TV monitor, showed arrest of the gunman’s brother, SPO2 Gregorio Mendoza, he reported. That triggered Mendoza’s massacre. <BR><BR>When was the Kapisanan Ng Mga Brodkaster’s rule book jettisoned? Or Poynter Institute’s “Guidelines for Covering Hostage-Taking Crises”?<BR><BR>“Strongly resist the temptation to telephone a hostage taker”, caution Poynter ”One wrong question” from the untrained, “could jeopardize someone’s life.”.<BR><BR>“Calling could tie up phone lines or otherwise complicate communication efforts by negotiators, the guidelines warn. “Always assume that the hostage taker has access to the reporting”.<BR><BR>“Was a live report worth the hostage deaths?”, UP mass communication students pressed broadcasters. We violated no law, , replied RMN’s anchors. We only reported. We are not negotiators. It’s not our fault.“<BR>Inquirer columnist Rigoberto Tiglao agrees. “The State’s overarching job is to save the victims, by whatever means,” he asserts in “Media Will be Media” commentary. “Cruel as it may sound, concern about the safety of hostages can not be media’s concern, even if we applaud media people whose priority is such….”<BR><BR>Inquirer’s Randy David has such priority. So do we. In his column “Madness and Accountability,” David writes: “Where lives are at stake…one does not need an explicit protocol for media behavior….RMN anchors kept hostage-taker Mendoza on the air …<BR><BR>“(This prompted) investigating committee member Teresita Ang-See’s justified retort: “Your profession should never be more important than human lives.” David adds. “It is what a commonsensical orientation to law and order requires of all citizens…. <BR><BR>Common sense compelled KBP to shred blanket defense of members. Individual stations began internal reviews. GMA-7 said it would come up with revised guidelines.<BR><BR>ABS-CBN aired a report that pinpointed police deployment, wrote Kara Santos of Asia Media Forum. But it refused to air the hostage taker’s threats live .If negotiators called for a temporary blackout, the station would have complied.<BR><BR>The Ang See “slashes” are compelling media to re-examine standards hewed from painful experience. These include Somali pirates detaining seamen, , Abu Sayyaf hostages in Sipadan to terrorists bundling ambassadors from an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Austria.<BR><BR>Associated Press to Der Speigel in Germany work have guidelines that peg preventing of harm as first duty. . Here are excerpts from British Broadcasting Corporation protocols:<BR><BR>“We should consider ethical issues raised by providing a platform to hostage takers, especially if they make direct contact. We must remain in editorial control…Thus, we do not interview a perpetrator live on air… or broadcast any video and/or audio provided by a perpetrator<BR><BR>“We broadcast recordings made by perpetrators, whether of staged events, violent acts or their victims, only after referral to a senior editorial figure…. We delay broadcasting live material of sensitive stories, specially when the outcome is unpredictable…<BR><BR>“When reporting stories relating to hijacking, kidnapping, hostage we must listen to advice from the police and other authorities about anything which, if reported, could exacerbate the situation.<BR><BR>“Occasionally the police will ask us to withhold information situation. We will normally comply with a reasonable request, but we will not knowingly broadcast anything that is untrue”.<BR><BR>“The BBC procedure for dealing with such requests must be followed” Translation: Those who don’t are fired. Will that happen here?<BR><BR>Is our problem deeper than reckless broadcasters? Read the New York Times obituary on New York City police chief Simon Eisdorfer.<BR><BR>He foresaw, in the 1972 hostage and murder of 11 Israeli athletes, at the Olympics in Munich, an emerging threat. And he cobbled today’s world emulated hostage negotiation team.<BR><BR>His team, in 1973, secured release of 12 unharmed hostages in Brooklyn. The gunmen surrendered after 47 hours. --- the first of many bloodless rescues<BR><BR>“He demonstrated effectiveness of protracted negotiation over armed confrontation.” New York Times said “Mr. Eisdorfer de-emphasized confrontation, focusing instead on saving lives.”<BR><BR>Our broadcasters dashed to Quirino grandstand and reported the obvious. But who saw --- and pointed out--the subtle institutional start of such emergencies? <BR><BR>For almost a decade, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo’s Department of Interior coddled Joseph Estrada and the Ampatuans. But it never crafted a negotiating team. Such a team would have made all the difference at Luneta. <BR><BR>But “we are limited, alas, not by our abilities, but by our lack of vision.”<BR><BR><BR> <BR>",

   "body": "<BR>Negros Oriental businessmen have called on the two Negros Oriental Electric Cooperatives (Noreco 1 and Noreco 2) to seize the offer of the Green Core Geothermal Inc. to supply power to the two electric cooperatives in Negros Oriental once their contract with the National Power Corporation expires in December.<BR> <BR>The businessmen made the call during a power forum organized by the Negros Oriental Chamber of Commerce and Industry Inc. last Wednesday at the Bethel Guest House, which Nocci interim president Edward Du said was called to find a solution to the problems of insufficient power supply and low voltage affecting all electric consumers in the province.<BR><BR>Frederick Dael, corporate member of Foundation University and managing director of CEOs, Inc., said the economy of Dumaguete is growing faster than the capacity of the electric company to provide power. <BR><BR>“I guess many Dumaguetenos are willing to pay a higher price for reliable power,” Dael said, as he bared that an increase in the cost of electricity will still be much lower than using diesel power generators.<BR><BR>Dael said the Silliman Medical Center, for instance, generates its own power during brownouts at a cost of from P14 to P16 per kilowatt hour. Noreco 2 residential consumers pay a rate of almost P7 per kwh. <BR><BR>“Even, say, at P10 per kilowatt hour, that will still be cheaper than P16,” Dael said.<BR><BR>Dael reminded the power stakeholders that the BPO industry in Negros Oriental, which pumps in millions of new money into the economy every month, is dependent on power. “If we don’t have enough power, these businesses will go away and we haven’t realized the impact of such a scenario.”<BR><BR>Green Core, which bought the National Power Corp. power plant in the town of Valencia last year, is offering to sell power to both Noreco 1 and Noreco 2 at P4.70 per kwh. The Noreco 2 buys power from Napocor at a subsidized rate of P3.82.<BR> <BR>Most of the businessmen present in the four-hour forum which lasted until 11 p.m. appeared to agree with Dael’s suggestion for the Noreco to seal the deal, even as the two electric cooperatives pointed out that the Green Core offer is no guarantee that there would be no more rotating brownouts.<BR><BR>“Contracting with Green Core is not a solution to the crisis because they also have load shedding,” said Engr. Chito Lozano, Noreco 2 engineering services manager. Engr. Elvin Dennoyo, chief of the Noreco 1 operations and maintenance division, also pointed out that both the NPC and Green Core have been resorting to load shedding in the areas they serve due to limited generation capabilities.<BR><BR>“We are now on equal footing to negotiate with Green Core,” Lozano said. 23 electric cooperatives in the Visayas, which have banded together in an effort to improve their bargaining position, want to buy power from Green Core at between P3.00 and P3.50. “The price of geothermal energy today is only P2.80. The price of P4.70, which Green Core is offering, is too high because it is pegged on the price of coal energy,” said a source privy to the negotiations, who asked not to be named.<BR><BR>Lozano said the five electric cooperatives in Negros island have a plan to invite investors to put up a 50 mw diesel plant in the island to be used solely to address shortages during peak hours. <BR><BR>The contract between both Norecos and the Napocor will expire on December 30, although Napocor has already assured the two Negros Oriental electric cooperatives that they will extend their supply contracts for one year. Napocor will supply Noreco 2 with 16.6 MW next year, and Noreco 2 are in negotiations with Green Core and Kepco for an additional 14 MW.<BR><BR>Ricky Tantoco, president and chief operating officer of the Energy Development Corporation, of which Green Core is a subsidiary, said their offer to the two Norecos has been on the table for some time.<BR><BR>Tantoco said the Green Core offer is the best option for Noreco because of its close location. He said that if Noreco buys from them, they do not have to experience the present problem of low voltage. There are also fewer chances of power interruptions.<BR><BR>Tantoco also said that the electricity they will sell to Noreco will actually be cheaper because power from geothermal energy is VAT-free and there will be fewer transmission costs and power losses.<BR><BR>Arman Lapus, vice president of First Gen, another Lopez-owned company, said now is a good time for Noreco to enter into a contract with them because other power companies in Cebu are interested on buying whatever they can supply at 60 percent load factor.<BR><BR>“The name of the game is contracting. If you don’t have a contract, you’ll be the first [to have load shedding],” Lapus said.<BR><BR>Gov. Agustin Perdices and Dumaguete Mayor Manuel Sagarbarria, on the other hand, agreed that the need of the hour is for Noreco to get stable power at reasonable cost. Perdices also volunteered to help the electric cooperatives evaluate their options in order to come up with the best solution to the power problem.<BR><BR> <BR><BR>",

Rey Lyndon Lawas.<BR> <BR>Perdices made the announcement to the local media this week although the appointment of Lawas has yet to be made official by the Philippine National Police hierarchy.<BR> <BR>Lawas was among the three senior police officers nominated in a list submitted to the governor for review.<BR> <BR>The two others are Sr. Supt. Constantino Barot and Sr. Supt. Edgar Pataan.<BR> <BR>Perdices had earlier disclosed that he was considering both Barot and Lawas for the position in lieu of outgoing provincial police director Sr. Supt. Augusto Marquez, Jr., who has already an extended tour of duty in Negros Oriental after having stayed here for more than two years.<BR> <BR>The governor had admitted in a radio interview early this week that his first choice was Barot, however, even before he could make a decision to pick him, Barot had already been appointed as the new provincial police director of Bohol.<BR> <BR>Perdices, who had a closed door meeting with Lawas last Monday, further said in that radio interview that even though Lawas was his second choice, he described it as “destiny” the way he unexpectedly became the governor of the province after Governor-elect Emilio Macias II died last June.<BR> <BR>Meanwhile, Sr. Supt. Lawas said that it does not matter whether he was just the second choice of the governor as it is an honor and privilege to be chosen to serve Negros Oriental, which he already considers his home.<BR> <BR>Lawas said some people may have interpreted the governor’s pronouncements in a different manner, but what is important is that he is willing to deliver what is expected of him and serve the mandate of the people. <BR> <BR>Furthermore, his previous assignments at varied positions in Dumaguete and Negros Oriental have helped him establish good rapport with the officials and the people, plus he is familiar with the terrain. <BR> <BR>Lawas, who originally hails from Compostela, Cebu province, is married to Dumagueteña, Janine Flores, who now heads the Land Transportation Office in Bais City, with whom he has two children.<BR> <BR>He graduated from the Philippine Military Academy Class 1987 and had first served in Negros Oriental immediately after graduation as a young lieutenant in the then Philippine Constabulary’s Regional Special Action Force.<BR> <BR>Other previous positions he held included being police chief of Dumaguete, commander of what is now the 705th Provincial Mobile Group, chief of the PNP Region 7 Firearms, Explosives, Security Agencies and Guards Supervisory Section (FESAGSS) and deputy provincial police director of Negros Oriental, next in command of Sr. Supt. Marquez, Jr.<BR> <BR>Lawas is currently the battalion commander of the Regional Public Safety Battalion (formerly the Regional Mobile Group) in Region 7.<BR> <BR>He was a recipient of the prestigious Top 10 COPS award, or the Country’s Outstanding Policemen in Service, in 2003, and also earned a Hall of Fame slot for bagging the country’s best FESAGSS award for three consecutive years. The FESAGSS-7 was excluded on the fourth year of competition after the grand slam award it had received. <BR> <BR>The most recent achievement for Lawas was when the RPSB-7 was awarded this year as the Best PNP Maneuver Unit in the country, the award of which was given by then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo early this year during the PNP’s founding anniversary.<BR> <BR>No date has yet been set for the turn-over of command and installation of Lawas pending official appointment from the PNP hierarchy.

The bones, that of a female Fraser’s dolphin (Lagenodelphis hosei), were recovered from a dolphin which had died of malnutrition and was found near the IEMS building on March 1, 2009.<BR><BR>SU President Dr. Ben Malayang III had earlier approved a request from Foundation University to exhume the bones and assemble them, as part of a learning activity of students and faculty of the two institutions.<BR><BR>The bones will be placed on display at the Foundation University library, where Dr. Malayang said, “it would it will be hung on display from the library’s ceiling and shared for display for educational enhancement, enlarge the view of the students to these educational materials and promote our natural resources.”<BR><BR>This activity was made possible because of a consortium entered into by the four Negros Oriental universities four years ago, where they agreed to share resources “in order to give the highest level of education to the youth and their environs.” The consortium was signed by Malayang, FU Chairperson Victor Vicente Sinco, Negros Oriental State University  President Dr. Henry Sojor and St. Paul University of Dumaguete President Sr. Nilda Masirag.<BR><BR>The universities agreed to promote common programs in the field of sports, culture, and academics.<BR><BR>“There was also a time when we made available certain books to the FU library when they needed it and we were also lent the expertise of a faculty member of the Negros Oriental State University at one point,” Malayang said, citing instances when the consortium was put to work. <BR><BR>Malayang said he believes he speaks for all universities by saying that the consortium has actually helped all universities and their students. <BR><BR>Dolar said the activity signified the beginning of the accomplishment of that goal of sharing of resources, knowledge, faculty, time, and specimens between the two schools.<BR><BR>Dolar finished her biology degree from Silliman University.

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>By Ma. Cecilia Genove<br><br>Master performer Ryan Cayabyab, popularly known in the entertainment sector as Mr. C, breezed into Dumaguete last week to conduct auditions for a national songwriting workshop in Manila soon. The one-day event was held at the College of Performing Arts,  Silliman University and attracted a number of aspiring songwriters who were further shortlisted. The auditions likewise served as a precursor to a forthcoming concert of the Ryan Cayabyab Singers at 8 p.m. on Saturday, September 18 at the Claire Isabel McGill Luce Auditorium, Silliman University.<br><br>The Ryan Cayabyab Singers (RCS) is the brainchild of the world-renowned Filipino composer and musician Ryan Cayabyab. In the past, he was also responsible for other successful vocal groups including Smokey Mountain, 14-K, and the San Miguel Master Chorale (SMMC). Smokey Mountain produced the likes of Geneva Cruz, Chedi Vergara and Jeffrey Hidalgo, while 14-K catapulted Jolina Magdangal into stardom. Likewise, the SMMC was considered one of the premiere choral groups during its time.  <br><br>The RCS was realized with a series of auditions that sieved 170 aspirants within the 18-25 age range. Only 37 qualified for the callback auditions and that number was further trimmed down to 17 hopefuls who were required to sing, dance, improvise, and show how well they could fare as overall performers.  After having gone through several changes in personnel since their inception, Mr. Cayabyab’s current dream team includes Anezka Alvarez, Kaich Tiuseco, Celine Fabie, Poppert Bernadas, Erwin Lacsa, Anton Anternorcruz and Miguel Mendoza. Each of their voices is unique, bringing something different to the group. <br><br>Kaich adds soul to the group with her jazzy and bluesy style that instantly gives a warmer vibe, while the youngest member Anton brings a fresh, new sound. To complement this, Poppert and Miguel make use of their distinct pop sounds with the former effortlessly reaching top notes and the latter bulding the group’s strong foundation with his deep tones. Celine adds sparkling tones that reflect her rigid training in theater while Erwin and Anezka have a certain vocal brilliance brought about by their experience in singing with a choir.  Together, these seven power soloists are a force to be reckoned with when they sing as an ensemble. The group’s edge lies in the members’ distinctive, individual talents and personalities, coupled with the youthful enthusiasm that endears them to their numerous fans. <br><br>This talented group had signed with Sony BMG Music Entertainment last September of 2007 and released their self titled album a couple of months after. The track list includes the new compositions <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hiling, Ayoko Na, Ito Na Nga ang Pagibig, Ba’t Di Mo Sinabi, Paano Na ‘To, I’ll Make You Smile Again,</span> as well as revivals of Mr. Cayabyab’s old compositions such as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hibang sa Awit, Call Me, Call Me, Hideaway</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hello Joe, Goodbye</span>. While their carrier single <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Let Me Love You Tonight</span> won “Best R&B Song”, they also gained recognition with the disctinction “Best Performance by a New Group” in the 21st AWIT Awards, an award-giving body specifically for the recording industry.<br><br>Since their formal launching in December of 2007, the RCS has awed audiences all over the country and abroad. At their concert debut in Davao in 2007, they received six standing ovations for their excellent performance. They also took part in the Filipinas Heritage Library’s Bravo Filipino Concert Series which brought them to perform around the metro and in Cebu, showcasing the world-class talents of Filipinos through the country’s own music. In June 2008, the RCS embarked on their 1st international concert tour in Singapore. They graced the Philippine Independence Day celebrations of the Philippine Embassy with their heart warming repertoire of Filipino music. In October of 2008, they carried out a 12-city tour of the US to raise funds for the benefit of Gawad Kalinga. Last year, they entertained and inspired Melbourne and Sydney during their short stint there in October. Most recently, they did an all-choreographed production of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Motown and Beyond</span> in Bacolod where their performance got the crowd on their feet; and a few weeks later returned to Singapore for another set of shows.  Their concerts are always a tremendous success, making the Filipinos abroad proud of their native land’s own music and outstanding talents. <br><br>In the local scene, the RCS has done a string of shows in malls and commercial establishments such as Eastwood City, Shangri-La Plaza and The Podium, to name a few. They also provide entertainment at corporate events, and have dipped into helping several charitable institutions, with a particular keenness for Gawad Kalinga, by performing for fundraisers. They were involved in another worthy cause for the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mangaawit (OPM) and their project titled, “Kaya Natin ‘To!”; which, aside from having recorded a single, was culminated in an explosive concert at the MOA open grounds with the country’s biggest artists in December of 2009. Earlier this year, they proudly represented the country as ambassadors to an international project called, “Fair Play: Anti-Corruption Youth Voices” of Jeunesses Musicales International based in Brussels, Belgium. <br><br>The group has also appeared in various television shows and have been invited as guests on different morning and late night shows. At the moment, the group is in the process of training new members for future projects which include their second recording album. <br>With their inimitable and outstanding artistry combined with their deep love for music, the Ryan Cayabyab Singers will no doubt continue to make waves in the music industry, and will certainly keep on proving to the world that the Filipino talent is indeed a treasure to be proud of.<br><br>For ticket reservation you may contact the Luce Auditorium Office at (035) 422-6002 loc 520 and the College of Performing Arts loc 250.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>“Why, you do not even know that will happen tomorrow.  What is your life?  You are a mist that appears for a while and then vanishes.” – James 4:14<BR><BR>My dear friend Em, the young father and husband who drowned on his birthday- August 29, 2010- during a family beach outing, passed on to be with the Lord midmorning of Saturday, September 3.  He fought dearly for his life for almost a week at St. Luke’s Hospital in Manila.  He left a young wife, Rina, their 8th month old baby boy, Zion Emmanuel and  Chrissy, the 9-  year old daughter of Rina from a previous relationship whom Em had legally adopted.  <BR><BR>I had the privilege of officiating the very first vigil service in his memory on September 4 during a 4AM dawn service at UCCP-Cosmopolitan Church. While waiting for Em’s remains to be brought to the church, I  had a few minutes with Rina and Em’s mother.  My moment with them was precious.  It was a kind of moment that required no words --- but just sincere and whole presence on my part. Twenty-eight days before the drowning incident, their son Zion Emmanuel was baptized. The celebration was grand. Many of their family and friends thought it was too lavish.  More so, quite a number were surprised why Em and Rina included a renewal of their marriage vows in the program. They had not even reached their 2nd wedding anniversary! But you see, I learned from all these that there are things we can best understand in hindsight. There are actions that require time before being fully comprehended. Before leaving for the beach that day, Em had whispered to Chrissy many times, “This is the happiest birthday of my life.”<BR><BR> Rina decided not to open Em’s casket for viewing.  There was no need to.  Em left so much good memories to his family and friends that were enough to fill their minds and hearts.  Like most of us, Em had his own share of life’s adventures.  But  two years ago, he tearfully gave his life to Christ during a prayer meeting he and Rina attended.  Many noticed the changes in EM’s life.  He openly talked about his faith to his friends and associates, even during business meetings .  He generously supported the work of Christ through his resources.  And most of all, he endeavored to build a Christ-centered home. <BR><BR>During his week-long battle for his life, Em went into cardiac arrest three times.  And each time that happened, Rina would beg the doctors to revive him.  During his very last arrest, Rina desperately pleaded the doctors to save Em’s life one more time.  The medical team tried to revive him for nearly twenty minutes but to no avail.  In the midst of all that chaos, Rina took a deep and long breath, held her husband’s hand  and tearfully shouted at the top of her voice, “Em, I’m now letting you go.” <BR><BR>To this day, I still feel a heaviness on my chest when I think of all that has happened to Em and Rina. What comforts me is God’s absolute sovereignty -- the certainty of eternal life which Christ has promised to those who believe and the assurance that Rina and her children will never be abandoned.  For the past weeks, I have been doing my share in reminding people during worship services and prayer gatherings that we cannot keep on putting off our relationship with the Lord.  You see, many of us may not actually have the time we think we still have.  While there is still time, we need to make peace with God and with others.   This past week, I have had the blessed and awesome privilege of witnessing people give their lives to Christ in the spirit of faith and renew their commitment to bring others to a relationship with the Lord by sharing the gospel of salvation.  <BR><BR>A relationship Christ, like all other relationships is never ever assumed.  It is consciously, personally and intentionally entered into in good faith.  It’s amazing how one can assume a relationship that may not be there in the first place.  Friends, Jesus is reminding us all today that he will never tire offering this relationship to us.  But such a relationship calls for a choice that must be made. It is a choice that is ours and ours alone. It is a choice that is urgent and pressing. This choice is not about membership to a religious denomination or activity.  It is a choice to live our lives in full and humble obedience to Christ—to live by his truth—to serve him with sincerity and to obey his call for us to make a difference in the world we live in.  <BR><BR>If  you are being led to make that choice now as you are reading this article, you may pray this prayer in the silence of your heart, “Jesus, you shed your blood on the cross of Calvary so that the whole world may be reconciled with God.  I am humbled to realize that I am part of the world you redeemed and died for.  In faith, I ask forgiveness for living my life independently of you.  Would you now receive, O Lord,  my life which I humbly offer  to you today in faith.  Walk with me, O Lord and fill me with your Spirit that I may live the life that will make a genuine difference in the world and bring true honor and glory to Your Name.  Amen.”  <BR><BR>",

Public nuisance that would last until dawn at 4 am, with loud music and shouting and shrieking by the customers. <BR><BR>2. Broken glasses and bottles that are scattered everywhere along the street, causing hazard among early morning joggers. <BR><BR>3. Foul smell of urine filling the air in the area. <BR><BR>4. Selling of liquor even to minors, violating a national law as well as a City ordinance <BR><BR>5.

Furthermore, citizens in tourist spots are encouraged to care for the environment because biodiversity is in itself a tourism attraction. <BR><BR>Awards were given to the following: Julius Caesar Carballo (FU)-Best Rebuttal Speaker, Regina Clarina Elmaco (SPUD) - Best Speaker, Eduard Joseph Narciso (SPUD)- Best Debater and St. Paul University- best Debating Team. <BR><BR>The debate tournament was adjudicated by Vice Mayor of Dumaguete City, Atty. Allan Cordova and Youth Formator, Dr. Dave Saceda. It was sponsored by the FU - School of Hospitality Management. (PR) <BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "<BR>docmequi@yahoo.com <BR><BR> <BR>An intriguing question with equally revealing answers. But first, let’s backtrack a bit to my column two weeks ago titled: Unitown and Teen Pregnancy. <BR><BR>In July this year, the implementing rules and regulations  of R.A. 9710, otherwise known as the Magna Carta of Women was approved. A controversial provision of the law, as far as Catholic and private institutions are concerned is that which “forbids all forms of discrimination against women, including schools’ refusal to grant enrollment or work to unmarried pregnant students and teachers.” <BR><BR>There’s an unwritten rule adopted by most, if not all academic institutions, prescribing that when an unmarried student gets pregnant, she has to leave school. This prescription is not put down in black and white, except I understand, in the Silliman University College of Nursing. I was told by a member of our Administrative Council that the reason for zeroing in on SU nursing students is because they are “supposed to be models of virtue.” Aren’t all girls supposed to be models of virtue? <BR><BR>In the week following the publication of my column, I instructed my students in PE 1, composed mostly of entering freshman students, to read it and be ready to react to it.  I would like to share with you the following results of a survey I conducted among these students because the information they provided could be a source of guidance for us academicians, parents and local government officials, on what we can do to minimize or prevent unwanted teen pregnancy which could wreck havoc on the future of our young people. <BR><BR>I asked the students to respond to three questions: <BR><BR>1. What can we do as your teachers in Foundation University to help and prevent you from the risks of unwanted teen pregnancy? <BR><BR>2. Considering only the students of Foundation University, not your acquaintances outside, do you know of anyone who is at risks? <BR><BR>3. If you answered yes, where do they do it? <BR><BR>In the required textbook that we are using in PE 1, Foundations of Wellness, there’s a chapter on the subject of Sexually Transmitted Diseases, hence, I thought that the survey I conducted was relevant and pertinent to the course. <BR><BR>There were a total of 154 respondents, 56 male and 98 female, ages 16 to 22, in three classes which meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I didn’t poll three other classes scheduled on Monday and Wednesday. <BR><BR>Let’s first consider their responses to questions numbers 2 and 3. <BR><BR>Among the male respondents, 20 (35.71%) answered “Yes”, 16 (28.57%) said “No”, and 20 (35.71%) did not respond to the question. The females responded this way:  48 (48.97%) “Yes,” 38 (38.77%) “No”, and 12 (12.24%) had no answer. I must hasten to add that the number and percentages do not necessarily reflect the number of girls at risk because the respondents could be familiar with and referring to the same person. Nevertheless, the fact that almost half of the female respondents said that they are aware of girls at risk of getting pregnant because they are into premarital sex is a cause of concern. <BR><BR>Where do they do it? Here are their answers: (a) at home when parents are away, (b) boarding houses, (c) lodging houses, (d) hotels and motels, (e) beach resorts, and (f), “at the backof the house and the reason the girl does not get pregnant is because she takes pills,” as one girl puts it. Others said that they “don’t know.” <BR><BR>Majority of the respondents, in response to question number 1, recommended that they should be provided with sex education and guidance by their teachers (“being second parents”) not to get into a situation of unwanted pregnancy. And here is the gist of an interesting recommendation given by six girls: if they (girls) get into a situation where “it can no longer be avoided, the girls should be given contraceptives.” Several of the boys were more direct: “Give the boys condom!” <BR><BR>An FU official emailed response: “My concern about this aside from my own personal views, is that if we go ahead and have the real and mature sex education and provide contraceptives to our students we may, and I would believe will, decrease our student enrollment because parents, no matter how true it is that their children are sexually active, will not agree to this.” <BR><BR>He further adds: “The conscious choice made by a young boy or girl for abstinence can only be accomplished through decades of consistent, rational edification.  That is how it has become possible for the youth here in the USA to make the choice between abstinence or contraception. Decades, let start now with the real and mature education sans any religious, emotional and social baggage.” <BR><BR>I pondered over all these information and views expressed by our students and administrators and I came up with the following recommendations: <BR><BR>1.  Provide sex education and counseling to the students. Their attendance in these sessions should be with the consent of the parents. <BR><BR>2. In cases where girls get into an intimate relationship with their boyfriends, and seek assistance in obtaining contraceptives, with their parents consent, they should be provided with contraceptives.<BR> <BR>3. Parents should make sure that when they leave their home, their daughter who is left behind is not alone. Ditto for the boy because as one girl said, the boy will ask the girl to come over to his house. <BR><BR>4. Owners of boarding houses that admit both male and female student-boarders should exercise their role as “loco parentis” and make sure that opportunities for intimacy among their boarders are prevented. <BR><BR>5. The Provincial and City governments should consider enacting ordinances which will prevent unmarried young couples from checking in lodging houses, hotels, motels, beach resorts and similar establishments. <BR><BR>It may be an opportune time for the Consortium of Higher Education in Negros Oriental entered into by the heads of the academic institutions in University Town, to sit down together and come up with a strong and common stand to address this social problem which could render for naught all our work and investments in the education and formation of our young people in this part of our country. <BR><BR><BR>",

Except- behind one giggling girl, a lone woman is squinting with anxiety and pain; and a  dark, somber face pokes up from behind the huge woman with the red baseball hat. But these are minor exceptions.<BR><BR>“Don’t worry, be happy!” – this is a phrase you hear constantly here, repeated like a mantra, especially on any occasion that seems to promise harm. The first time I heard it was from a dentist who was about to drill my teeth. I heard it again from a doctor as she handed me a prescription for a strong pain reliever. “Don’t worry, be happy,” she said, and smiled. “We are a happy people,” she added, after a pause.<BR><BR>Well, the people you see certainly seem happy enough. Foreign tourists who come here frequently comment on the friendly faces and smiles they see around them as they pass, or when they stop to take pictures. “Sir! One shot! Me and my brother!” Smile. Click. And they’re gone.<BR><BR>A survey was recently conducted in many countries around the world. Only one question was asked of everyone: “ Are you happy with your life?” In the Philippines, unlike other countries, the vast majority of people asked said that they were happy. <BR><BR>The conclusion was that Filipinos were among the happiest people in the world. That clearly isn’t true. If, with all the problems ordinary people face here they were always happy with their lives… well, there would be something seriously wrong with them. But they’re not really that crazy.<BR><BR> When you ask people about their feelings, with questions like “Are you happy with your life?” you’ll get a revealing answer, but not a true one. The answer will tell you- not how they really feel, but what they think they should say, what they’ve been taught to think, what you expect to hear. <BR><BR>The people in this picture seem like a happy bunch, but who knows?<BR>People here are taught to look happy, to smile automatically with other people, to keep their bad feelings hidden and deny them- to each other, even to themselves. <BR><BR>This is more than just good manners; it’s a way to enforce social stability, to keep things as they are. “Don’t worry, be happy!” This is not friendly advice; it’s a command.  <BR><BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport9-19-10.jpeg\"><BR>",

But  for  the first time, impeachment  went beyond domestic walls. <br><br>The UN Commission on Human  Rights, on March 23, slammed  the Ombudsman for  inaction on the murder of  Navy Ensign Phillip Andrew Pestaño aboard the RPB Bacolod City. This 23-year old officer blocked   loading of  14,000 board feet of “hot logs” and shabu on the navy vessel. <br><br>The Ombudsman recognized, in August 2007, the need to  further investigate. “None ever took place”, the UN noted. Ms. Gutierrez would  not  even meet Pestano parents: Felipe and Evelyn. <br><br> “The State party is bound to conduct an investigation and ensure that there is no impunity,” the UN Human Rights Committee pointed out. The Philippines fractured the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.” <br><br>Pestano’s parents are principal complainants in the impeachment. They’re joined by former Akbayan representative Risa Hontiveros-Baraquel and General Danilo Lim. <br><br>After the UN statement, the Ombudsman shook off  years of  stodgy coma. Like the panicked  Pandora of ancient myth, it tried to slam shut  the Pestano case box --- with a hastily cobbled  dismissal. <br><br>Too late.  Years of  inaction  saw Pestano’s murder and forgotten Navy desaparecidos  displayed for the world to gawk at. Government must report within 180 days, “what enforceable remedies and solutions were taken,” the UN wrote. <br><br>“Impeach the Ombudsman,” Inquirer’s editorial  demanded. The House Committee on Justice will receive evidence to determine  “ sufficiency of  cause” on  Sept 21.  If  91 congressmen see the obvious, they’ll  lob  charges to the  Senate “We’re cautiously optimistic,” Rep. Walden Bello says. “Momentum is on our side.” So are key  administration legislators. Including Deputy Speaker Lorenzo “Erin” Tanada, Raul  Daza, and Isabelle Climaco. Arroyo turncoats signed up. <br><br>Is this the end of  impeachments hostaged by Malacanang? Joseph Estrada let Elections Commissioner Luzviminda Tancangco off the hook..  Lower House allies  opened escape hatches for  serial charges lodged against Gloria Macapagal  Arroyo. <br><br>Wedging the Ombudsman into the dock will test  political  scientist Arthur Schlesinger’s note: “The genius of impeachment lay in the fact that  it could punish (the office holder) without punishing the office” <br><br>Pestano’s parents look beyond their 15 year search for closure. They hope an opened “Pandora’s box” will also bring justice long denied to  lowly Navy enlisted men who disappeared. <br><br>Among  t he desaparecidos is Zosimo Villanueva. From  the naval station in Tawi-Tawi, he tipped Pestano  on the loading of  hot logs and drugs on. BRP Bacolod City. A Caviteno, Villaneuva  lived with his Muslim wife in Bongao .<br><br>After Pestano was murdered, Villanueva  “disappeared”  while on a mission. Lost at sea, said other sailors who returned. He’s still missing.  The Navy produced no official investigation report. <br><br>The Philippines, in fact,  glossed over Villanueva’s death. the UN pointedly observed.  The disappearance remains uninvestigated. “Foul play is suspected.” <br><br>Fidel  Tagaytay served  as  radio operator when BRP Bacolod City meandered all over Manila Bay before docking  off Roxas Blvd --- when Pestano’s body was found. As radio operator, Tagaytay, was privy to communications from Navy headquarters to the ship.<br> <br>In a  handwritten note,  Tagaytay’s  wife,Leonila  sent  the Navy a handwritten letter stating:  Fidel had been ordered to report to Navy headquarters. Since then, he too disappeared. There has been “no action / investigation by the Navy,” the UN  snapped. <br><br>What  was Ensign Alvin  Farone’s role?  He was aboard BRP Bacolod City. Pestano was slain somewhere on the boat and dumped in his cabin, Senate Report 800 notes. <br><br>Farone was hospitalized  at the Navy medical facility in Sangley Point,  following a fall. That is on record. It is known that he contacted Marissa, Pestano’s  sister. He wanted “to tell what really happened to Phillip”. <br><br>A long silence followed. The next time Farone called he was confined in V. Luna Military Hospital. His gangrenous  foot  was going to be amputated  Marissa and mother were turned away when they  tried  to visit  Farone at V. Luna. “No longer here,” was the reason offered. <br><br>Marissa learned later that Farone was brought to the Kidney Center. His leg had been  amputated. Apparently, Farone was returned  to V. Luna after the amputation.  After two weeks, Marissa learned that Farone died. <br><br>“Dead men tell no  tales.”  In their UN complaint, the Pestanos claim that  Farone’s  demise was “suspicious. It   should have been investigated’. Again,  the Philippines  didn’t  even comment on this case. Shouldn’t  have this this  death been probed, if only to shield  the good name of  Navy and  Armed Forces medical centers? <br><br>“They were  faceless, powerless  enlisted men,” notes  Counsel Enrique Angeles  who shepherded the case through the UN. “Like the Villanuevas, Fidel’s  wife  had  no resources to pursue the case. <br><br>“They were like  trees, felled in the forest. No one sees. No one knows. No one cares.  But perhaps, impeachment  may spark  a  glimmer of hope.”  Perhaps.” <br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "By Ramon Llera Vilar III <BR><BR>Shopping has become one of the favorite past times of people, even those that come from Dumaguete. One can truly say that shopping is both enjoyable and relaxing. Nothing beats the thrill you get from going to the mall to hunt for things that you like. And because of today’s modern technology, shopping has become just a click away from your mouse. {{more}}<BR><BR>There are so many things you can find and choose in online shops—from shirts, bags, organic soaps to even contact lenses. Name it, they have it. You just have to be patient in looking for the things that you want. <BR><BR>Gone are those days when you spend one whole day in a crowded place and only end up with aching feet. You don’t even have to worry about having the same shirt with the girl you meet along the boulevard— the dilemma that probably most Dumaguetenos encounter every day because of the limited clothing shops in town. <BR><BR>Online shopping has become the newest trend in the cyber world and it’s spreading like wildfire. <BR><BR>One of the first online sellers in Dumaguete, Engr. Veronica F. Valente, owner of Veronica’s Closet (veronicascloset.multiply.com) shares her experience:  “I started toying with the idea in 2006 but I it took me until February 2007 to get things going. I started out with six items. It all got sold within days. I loved the rush I get when someone buys a dress that I have redesigned.” <BR><BR>Alongside her profession as a licensed civil engineer, designer, personal stylist and part-time wedding coordinator, Rona started her online store three years ago because she was influenced with online vintage stores and her love for clothes. <BR><BR>She usually goes to thrift shops to buy unique and one-of-a-kind clothes and would alter, restyle, and resize them so she could wear them. “My friends would ask me where I usually buy my clothes, and I delightfully tell them that I found it at the ukay-ukay. Every chance I get, I would go to ukay-ukay stores and rummage through piles of clothes. Eventually, I realized I had bags full of clothes (not including my overflowing closet), and so I thought, why not sell some? So, I sold some clothes to friends. Not long after that, my client list started expanding. Eventually, I decided to sell online,” expressed Rona. <BR><BR>She plans to have a name for herself on the local internet market as the shop to go to for unique and vintage yet affordable clothes. <BR><BR>So how does it actually work? First, you browse for possible shops on line. Facebook and Multiply are among the top sites where you can check out these shops. The most important thing to understand when you engage in online shopping are the guidelines set by the sellers so as to avoid discrepancies in the future. <BR><BR>“It’s easier for both parties; we ask them to fill out the order form and I just send them a message after,” said Kharyl Mae O. Fulraman, co-owner of Trendy B Shoppe (kharylmae.multiply.com). <BR><BR>Payments are usually done through bank-to-bank services or through money transferring agencies. Usually the buyers pay for the shipping fee. They are also expected to send a copy of the original receipt or control number as proof of payment. And only after this is the seller be able to ship the item. Shipping usually takes just a couple of days. <BR><BR>This procedure, however, does not necessarily apply with all instances especially when both the seller and the buyer reside just along the same area. “They (buyers) just text me our meeting place and once we meet I give them the item and they just pay me directly,” says the owner of Guching Buynow Gucci Mae C. Florendo (facebook.com/guchingbuynow). <BR><BR>But you must be very careful when engaging with business online since you are dealing with someone whom you haven’t really met. Kharyl shared: “There was once when I was scammed worth Php 6,000 from online shopping and we tried to know who the person was behind it and after a month we finally found out and he ended up paying me more than the amount for the damages.” With that money and her new discovered interest, she opened her own online store.  <BR><BR>“You just have to be careful of ‘bogus’ sellers and scammers. If the person does not push through with the order and does not even update me, I simply put the item back ‘on the rack’ and deal with the buyer personally. I also mentally list her down as a buyer that I might have second thoughts dealing with again,” said Veronica. <BR><BR>Despite the risks, online shops still make shopping more convenient and practical. Instead of spending hours walking in the mall and finding nothing, you can be in the comfort of your own home, just clicking and shopping. <BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "Dumaguete City Mayor Manuel Sagarbarria has appealed to businessmen to increase their tax payments to the City to ensure the continued delivery of basic services. {{more}}<BR> <BR>Sagarbarria made the call in an interview after he noted that the supposed economic boom of Dumaguete due to the entry of call centers and other Information Communication Technology (ICT)-based businesses has not resulted in a corresponding increase in business taxes. <BR><BR>“Percentage wise, the taxes have even gone down over a three-year period,” the mayor said. <BR><BR>The business community had painted a rosy picture of a booming Dumaguete economy last year with the employment of about 3000 workers in call centers and ICT businesses. While these businesses are still enjoying a business tax holiday for the first five years, they are expected to pump in more than P20 million every month to the Dumaguete economy in salaries to their workers. <BR><BR>“The families of these 3000 workers would translate to about 15,000 people who directly benefit from the operation of these call centers,” said Engr. Gregorio Uymatiao Jr., chairman of the Negros Oriental Business Development Foundation during an investment forum in Dumaguete last week. “This is already good for the City.”  <BR><BR>The entry of call centers, and the increased flow of money into the Dumaguete economy, is thought to benefit other industries in the City like the hotel and restaurant industry and the construction industry, among others. <BR><BR>Sagarbarria, however, said that the increased economic activity has also resulted in an increase in the Dumaguete population which has also increased the demand for services in the City. <BR><BR>“Now, people want more lights on the streets, more policemen to patrol the streets, and there is also more garbage to collect. But we are hard put in responding to these needs because we do not have enough taxes,” Sagarbarria said. <BR><BR>Last year, the City collected P160 million in local taxes and got about the same amount in Internal Revenue Allotment. It operates on a P400 million annual budget. <BR><BR>Sagarbarria said that in January 2011, the City will need an additional P24 million to pay government workers under the Salary Standardization Law. “Where will I get the money to pay for that? If there is no increase in tax collection, some of the City’s services will surely be affected,” he said. <BR><BR>He said that the City does not have money to hire policemen. The National government is supposed to give the Dumaguete Police Station 300 policemen but the budget from the PNP is only good for 80.   <BR><BR>This paradox of a low tax take amid a supposedly booming economy has also puzzled officials of the Bureau of Internal Revenue in Dumaguete City. <BR><BR>A BIR official, who asked not to be identified, said they have been conducting surveillance activities on restaurants and other business who are expected to benefit from the supposed Dumaguete boom so they could also get more taxes for the national government. <BR>",

   "body": "The Philippine Export Zone Authority has rallied local government units in Negros Oriental to prepare for the expansion of IT companies in Metro Manila, which could follow the lead of call centers and other IT companies who have invested in Negros Oriental. {{more}}<BR><BR>Elmer San Pascual, PEZA promotions manager, have been PEZA to LGUs: Prepare for expansion of IT companies in Metro Manila. “We see double digit growth for these companies,” San Pascual said. <BR><BR>The Philippines ranks second to India worldwide in  the call center industry and is the leading provider for non-voice ICT services such as editing and medical transcription. <BR><BR>Negros Oriental has several ICT companies, like Teletech, SPI, PLDT e-Ventus, Qualfon, Entheos IT, and some smaller companies. <BR><BR>The PEZA grants a four- year tax exempt status for ICT companies which move to PEZA zones. A PEZA zone, San Pascual said, can be any building anywhere in the country which is endorsed by the local government unit, accredited by the PEZA and is proclaimed a PEZA zone by the President of the Philippines. <BR><BR>Because of the tax-exempt status of PEZA companies, local government units will simply postpone their income as they will start earning only on the fifth year. <BR><BR>After the expiration of the income tax holiday, these businesses will pay a five percent tax from their gross income to the government. Of this tax, three percent will go to the national government through the Bureau of Internal Revenue while two percent will go to the local government unit, to be paid to the municipal or city treasurer. <BR><BR>“This is big money,” San Pascual said. <BR><BR>Local government units, however, seemed reluctant to bite at the PEZA enticement as they would lose control over the PEZA business operations. PEZA firms do not need to get a Mayor’s Permit to operate their business because they are covered by the PEZA franchise. <BR><BR>Dumaguete City Administrator William Ablong said LGUs must have a say in regulating businesses inside the PEZA zone. “If they do not register with the local government, they have no name in our books. They may not be able to avail of the City’s services such as garbage collection, health services and police protection.” <BR><BR>San Pascual said that while the law says that all PEZA –registered firms are exempt from all fees and permits required by the LGU, the PEZA and the LGU may enter into a memorandum of agreement to identify nominal fees which the PEZA will pay for garbage collection and other services. This MOA will be patterned after an agreement the PEZA had entered into with the City of  Makati. <BR><BR>Engr. Greg Uymatiao, Jr., the chairman of the Negros Oriental Business Development Foundation, said that while local government units are not earning taxes from the operation of call centers in the PEZA zones in Dumaguete, it is already good that these companies support about 3,000 employees and their families. “This translates to about 15,000 people in Dumaguete who are supported by these call centers,” Uymatiao said. <BR><BR><BR>",

According to this stranding network, media is a powerful tool, and affects a large percent of the population. It also provides most of the information people know about stranding. The continuous sharing of information will lead to more accurate coverage and will encourage better public education. A more informed public is beneficial to them to raise awareness of the value of marine mammals and to motivate communities to be more concerned about the preservation of their marine resources as a whole. <BR><BR>Inao urged everyone if they find a stranded dead or alive marine mammal, it must be reported immediately to BFAR- Siquijor (035) 377-2486 or the Provincial Agriculture Offi ce (035) 377-2067 and provide crucial information useful for marine mammal conservation such as your location, name and contact numbers, and description and condition of the animal (size, shape, color and any wounds). <BR><BR>Meanwhile, marine mammals in the Philippines are protected by law.

In the last three years, Dumaguete has seen a tax increase of only P10 million. “It’s decreasing, percentage wise,” Mayor Manuel Sagarbarria said in a recent investment forum. <BR><BR>The irony is that while the City’s tax collection efficiency remains low, the increased economic activity in Dumaguete resulting from the money pumped in by these call centers estimated to be not less than P20 million each month has resulted in an increase in the demand for services from the City. <BR><BR>People now are calling for more police visibility to address criminality.

It’s so cheap and ordinary we don’t give much thought to it. You scribble on it, you read it, and that’s that.<br><br>Now what if, just consider what if, all the paper notebooks in the world were owned by the companies that made them. Those companies would have the exclusive rights to the manufacture, distribution, and use of notebooks.<br><br>If you needed a notebook, you would pay to get it from one of those companies... but... you wouldn’t really own the notebook. Having exclusive rights, the company you got it from would still own it. The company would only give you the rights to use the notebook, for your use exclusively, and to only use it for writing. At any time, the company can look into your notebook to see what you used it for.<br><br>If you violated those rights, let’s say by tearing out a page and making a paper hat, or by doodling flowers on it, or by letting a friend write on “your” notebook, the company reserves the right confiscate the notebook and throw you in jail.<br><br>That sounds like a crummy deal, right? And it is. But guess what: that’s the case with proprietary software nowadays. Consider the Microsoft End-User License Agreement (EULA). This is the document that governs the use of software like Windows. This is a legally-binding document, mind you, honored and enforced by the Philippine government. (It doesn’t matter that you didn’t read it, you agreed to it when you installed the software on your computer.)<br><br>Item 8 of the Windows 7 Professional EULA states:<br><br>SCOPE OF LICENSE.<br>The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the features included in the software edition you licensed. The manufacturer or installer and Microsoft reserve all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not: work around any technical limitations in the software; reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation; use components of the software to run applications not running on the software; make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation; publish the software for others to copy; rent, lease or lend the software; or use the software for commercial software hosting services.<br><br>Microsoft is my favorite example, but is by no means the only culprit. Several other software companies also impose similar restrictions.<br><br>If our notebooks were placed under the same set of rules as our software, there would be no paper airplanes, or paper hats, or doodles on their pages. You couldn’t tear out binding to see what glue they used. You couldn’t lend your notebook to a friend, much less give it away. You couldn’t do any of these things because the notebooks wouldn’t be yours.<br><br>It’s a crummy deal, right? For notebooks as well as software.<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

That line is cribbed from a 1955 Spanish film classic.<br><br>In this Cannes Film Festival entry, the orphan Marcelino snitches bread and wine from the monastery’s pantry. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tiene cara de hambre</span>, he explains on offering them to the Crucified. That film spun off into the ABS-CBN drama <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Philippines – May Bukas Pa</span>.<br><br>More visages, shriveled by need, is guaranteed tomorrow, unless decisive reforms are adopted, warn the Philippine Institute for Development Studies and United Nations Children’s Fund.<br><br>Chronically-famished youngsters increased by over a million in three years: these kids grapple daily with lack of water, medicine, a roof, or a school.<br><br>About 9.2 million— the population of 14 Sorsogons —cluster in rural barangays. The others meld into slums of Manila, Cebu, Davao and other cities. One out of 10 kids in the National Capital Region is an “informal settler”.<br><br>In this country, “the powerful buy the lowly for pair of sandals.” These children drew the short straw Barely had their lives started, their futures were shredded. Is it “almost too late” for them?<br><br>Traditional yardsticks, like per capita income, “ do not truly reflect what is happening in the regions,” PIDS president Josef T Yap cautions. PIDS and Unicef gauges “other deprivations”: shelter, health, education, water, simple toilets, an extra light bulb — and information.<br><br>Poverty rates in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao exceed 69 percent. This penury level quadruples that of the National Capital Region.<br><br>“ Metro Manila, Soccksargen and Central Luzon have the largest share of children who suffer from multiple deprivations,” estimate Celia M. Reyes and Aubrey Tabuga of PIDS.<br><br>Main poverty issues in the National Capital Region swirl around shelter and squatting. The number of children, in informal settlements, doubled in 21 years.<br><br>In five years, school dropouts bolted from 1.8 million to 2.2 million.<br><br>The National Statistical Coordination Board’s Child Development Index tracks that downward spiral.<br><br>Wasting from chronic hunger is often overlooked. But the last National Nutrition Survey stumbled across “the largest rise in prevalence of underweight kids” in three years. The proportion of stunting and thin children likewise bolted..” Tiene cara de hambre.<br><br>Progress has been spotty. “The proportion of children deprived of electricity has rapidly gone down. Those without access to radio, TV, telephone or computer also decreased. Access to water and sanitary facilities improved”.<br><br>But seven out of 10 in Lanao del Sur still drink from unsafe wells, notes Human Development Report. Compare that with one in Bulacan Daily, 3,700 migrate in search of jobs abroad so their kids can break free from a “lost decade”.<br><br>By happenstance, the network Social Watch Philippines also released its report <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Winning the Numbers, Losing the War.</span><br><br>Government will flub Millennium Development Goals on halving poverty, tamping down maternal and infant death rates, plus ensuring universal primary education, the “shadow report” asserts.<br><br>Presented to Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile and Speaker Sonny Belmonte, the study sketches a catch up plan.<br><br>“Many would still be left behind”, when curtains fall on MDGs in 2015, warns SWP convenor Isagani Serrano. “The Philippines is in a worse poverty situation in 2010 than in 2000 when 180 countries adopted the MDGs .<br><br>Don’t look now. But are those not the Arroyo years? In that decade, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Le Cirque</span> dinners, serial government corporation bonuses or diluted fertilizers commanded priority over destitute kids and wizened mothers.<br><br>In 2000, estimates already revealed serious budgetary shortfalls, former national treasurer Leonor Magtolis Briones stressed. But government didn’t bridge the gap. Applying the 2010 pork barrel for human needs, instead of waiting sheds, would be a good start to recover a “lost decade.”<br><br>“Those who suffer multiple deprivations… are often hidden and hard to reach, “UNICEF representative Vanessa Tobin …( But ) 44 percent of children living in poverty is too high We can, and must, take steps” to reduce that.<br><br>President Benigno Aquino whittled his delegation for the UN General Assembly – which will assess MDG goals. No congressman will sneak aboard. Having a profligate Rep. Imelda Marcos strut at the UN as House chair of MDG committee, would have been gross.<br><br>PNoy should refuse to paper over failures in achieving MDGs. His UN audience is savvy. They know Gloria Macapagal Arroyo dumped this mess on him.<br><br>The President must resist the temptation to seek refuge in similar failure by other countries. Indeed, “the gap in child mortality is widening, in some nations, by as much as 10 percent…”As in the Philippines, “children from the poorest households run twice the risk of dying before age five”.<br><br>The only acceptable currency is reform. The President must focus on the poorest and the most deprived. Supported by World Bank and Unicef, ongoing conditional cash transfers aim to reach four million families by 2012. Aquino must harness local governments and civic society in similar initiatives.<br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Do you hear the children crying, o my brothers/Ere sorrows come with the years?”</span> Browning asked.<br><br>Few hear in a country of leaders deafened by sleaze. Aquino’s reforms must be sustained if they’re to recover a lost decade. Only then, will they echo the Master’s directive: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ephphetha</span>. “Be thou opened”.<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

I had my camera with me, so I quickly picked it up and got this shot, then put it down again, before everybody stopped and posed and smiled. I didn’t have time; I was in a hurry. But now I don’t remember why, or where I was going. After all, it was more than ten years ago.<br><br>What caught my eye was the contrasting personalities that radiated from the two attendants working there. Aside from that, wasn’t anything unusual going on. It’s just a quiet small town scene, a little gas station surrounded by open fields and dilapidated old buildings. The road is more or less empty, even in the middle of the afternoon. <br><br>The same gas station is here today, on the South Highway going out of town,  but everything around it has changed. The rusty galvanized shed behind the pedicab is gone; the entrance gate to the Teletech call center is there now. The open field on the right was, at that time, a broad pasture full of grazing cows. Now the cows are gone, replaced by Robinson’s mall. <br><br>It’s certainly not a quiet small town scene there now.  Buildings are big and bright and new. There’s no open space in sight, only the hot concrete parking lots around Robinson’s. The antique looking pedicabs are still there, but multiplied from an occasional passing to a smoke spewing horde, joined in sluggish confluence with endless cars and motorcycles crawling in and out of the mall. The road is never empty now, even at night. What was once the edge of town is now the new center.<br><br>And it follows the new pattern- gigantic shopping malls surrounding a decaying center of town- You can see it in Cebu, Manila, Bacolod and now, here in Dumaguete. It’s what people want now, with cell phones, <br>I-pads, laptops: new, cool, clean, fast.  And all these things, all these places, all look about the same. You could be anywhere.<br><br>In this picture, none of that has happened yet. And still, even now, not everything has changed. We still need gasoline, and people to pump it.<br>And people haven’t changed. --Like this young woman, with her pleasant air of efficiency.

The normal level, or baseline, is statistically determined based on data from past flu seasons.<BR><BR>Dumaguete City had 270 cases and 2 deaths, while the town of Sibulan recorded 125 cases with one (1) death since January this year.<BR><BR>On the other hand, barangays Bagacay, Banilad, Camanjac and Piapi in Dumaguete City are also considered as hotspot areas.<BR><BR>Pacholo Alcantara, surveillance officer of the Department of Health in Negros Oriental, said a total of 1214 dengue cases have been recorded with 10 fatalities in the Province since January. This number has exceeded last year’s 1007 cases and 5 fatalities by 20.5 percent.<BR><BR>Alcantara said that in Negros Oriental a total of 147 dengue cases have been recorded during the 24th week, while 156 cases were recorded on the 35th week. There was a decrease of 132 cases on the 36th week while the figure for last week was pegged at 67. Alcantara, however, clarified that this number could still increase once patients admitted for suspected dengue would officially be diagnosed as having dengue fever.<BR><BR>With the current Dengue trends, DOH encourages all local government units to intensify information campaigns on dengue emphasizing on the importance of eliminating the breeding grounds of mosquitoes and mobilize the community to actively participate in environmental sanitation drives such as the Barangay Brigade Campaigns.<BR><BR>The DOH recommends 4S as effective measures in fighting dengue. First is, Search and Destroy. She asked everyone to clean up containers that holds water that would eventually be breeding places of mosquitoes e.g. used tires, cans, bottles, bottle caps (tansans), plastics receptacles, uncovered drums, roof gutters, dish drainers, refrigerator drainers, washing machine drainers, coconut husks, bamboo fences, leaves of bananas and bromeliad plants.<BR><BR>The insides of flower vases must be scrubbed thoroughly once a week. Director Madarieta said the Aedes egypti mosquitoes carrying the dengue virus do not thrive on dirty waters like creeks and canals. These mosquitoes breed and thrive on shiny and dark places.<BR><BR>Secondly, Self-protection measures. “Wear long pants and kamisetas at night and use mosquito repellants on daytime,” Madarieta said. Thirdly, Seek early consultation. Consult right away to the nearest health center or hospital when one has fever for 2 days and got rashes.<BR><BR>Lastly, Saynoto indiscriminate fogging. Fogging can be done when there is already a dengue outbreak in the area, she added. (with PIA report)<BR><BR><BR>",

This three-digit game is as alive as ever not only in Pampanga but even here in our own Province of Negros Oriental. Here it’s called Bagdok.<BR><BR>It would seem like it is easier to catch an “usher,” i.e., someone who sells Bagdok tickets, than to catch a mouse. True enough, several police raids in the past have resulted in the arrest of “ushers” along with “evidence,” such as bet money, ticket stubs and the like, but this hasn’t failed to stop this illegal game. For one, none of the suspected “big fish” have been found guilty, much less brought to court.<BR><BR>Could it be that Jueteng or Bagdok thrives because it is allowed by our officials to continue? Any illegal game, whether Tigbakay, Bagdok and what-have-you, have thousands of voters who patronize or even swear by these games. In a province in the Visayas (not Negros Oriental), even the governor asked the provincial police commander to “go slow” in running after Tigbakay. “It’s their only form of recreation and it is also a social event for these people, as they only get to see their friends and relatives at times like this,” the governor was quoted to have told the policeman.<BR><BR>These illegal games are the modern-day opium of the masses. There have been calls to legalize these operations but they cannot be legalized because they instead compete with the state-sponsored gambling, like lotto.<BR><BR>What are we to do? Should we continue pretending to be against illegal gambling? Or do we adopt the now popular line of a former mayoralty candidate: “If it pleases the people, it also pleases God!”<BR><BR>",

Petit and Alex were on talking terms all right.<br><br>But I felt a cold undercurrent, if not a total estrangement, between my two close friends. I learned later from both of them separately the heart of the matter. It was a news item Alex wrote in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dumaguete Metropost</span> which stereotyped Petit as a man “saying one thing, and doing another” with regards to the death of the winning candidate in the recent election and the rule on succession.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Easy to be Hard</span><br></div><br><br>        To Petit’s assertion that it would have been all right if it was written as an opinion and not as a news item, it is very easy for a journalist to claim that such is the trend in news-writing in a national newspaper like the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Philippine Daily Inquirer</span>. It is easy for oneself to stand firm as a journalist, and proclaim that the public deserves to know.<br><br>Such was the conceit assumed by the journalists in the Manila hostage-taking crisis that resulted in the death of eight Hongkong nationals. It was convenient for them to forget the journalist’s aphorism that no story is worth a life. The rating game was foremost in their minds. When news scoop becomes the ultimate, it is very easy for a journalist to forget the sensibility and sensitivity of the news object. The vulnerability of the news subject. It is all very easy...very easy to be hard.<br><br>I have watched Petit’s political fortune rise from Mayor to Vice Governor. Once I wrote a news item about him as the Manjuyod Mayor who was concerned more of building the character of his people rather than infrastructure. His kind of local governance earned him a pat in the back from his former law professor, the dean of the SU College of Law.<br><br>Together with the late Provincial Atty. Wilfredo Salmin, his fellow Development Academy of the Philippines trained youth leader under the New Society, we talked of the days when the young would take over the provincial reins from the political fogies. It was not to be. He had to run the gauntlet. Now he was facing certain defeat except for a slim hope on a hazy rule of succession.<br><br>It is very hard to face one’s first political setback. It is very easy, therefore, to make someone snuffing out that glimmer of hope as a villain. It easy to see malice from anyone. It is easy to indulge in a blame game. Easier to find a scapegoat. Blame everybody else except oneself. Easiest to be very very hard.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Enemy is Us</span><br></div><br><br>        I can see where both of my friends are coming from. I can empathize with Petit’s anger and self righteous indignation.<br><br>As a journalist, I understand Alex’s haughty nonchalance. Both are acting from the disadvantaged point of human weakness.<br><br>I, too, am prone to such lame human reactions – to be unforgiving and vain. In every conflict, we demand to resolve the issues always on our respective selfish terms, not on the objective truth, never on God’s truth.<br><br>We pray the Lord’s Prayer almost daily. But what have we done to hallow his name? What have we done to make His Kingdom come here on Earth?<br><br>We mouth the grace of forgiveness, but we embrace in our hearts the idea of getting even all the time. We pray to be delivered from the Evil One, yet we are full of evil schemes against our perceived enemies. Plainly and simply, the enemy is us.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Overcoming Evil with Love</span><br></div><br><br>        I tried to explain to Petit that he is a loser many times over if he keeps harboring the resentment. In pointing to an open door of spiritual healing, I argued that the news item ought to hurt him only once, on the day that he read it. Though the bitterness remains, it ought not hurt him again a day after.<br><br>By choice, we can treat it as a curse or blessing. Taking it as a curse will make ourselves as the enemy. Then maybe, it is easier to forgive that enemy as we can easily love ourselves. Easier to do good to those who hate you, easier to bless those who curse you, and pray for those who mistreat you.<br><br>Easy to love the enemy, just love thyself in Jesus’ name. Absolutely not on Techno man’s name.<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

It is on this light that Mayor Manuel “Chiquiting” T. Sagarbarria envisioned the development of the Coastal Boulevard, which is deemed to enhance tourism in the City. Thus, the plan would surely boost our economy.<BR><BR>I know the reference doesn’t sound too environment-friendly, but it’s like “hitting two birds with one stone”: developing the North Boulevard and the South Boulevard with a stone wall along the coastline that would serve as sea guard, in case a tsunami would strike.<BR><BR>Another area of development is the conversion of the public market buildings including the fish terminal at the back of the Bell Tower into one mall type three-storey building. This is going to house the fruit and vegetable market, the fish terminal, and this time, with added space for public and private office spaces.<BR><BR>These are just some of the flagship projects of Mayor Chiquiting as he realized: “I am racing against time. I cannot afford to tarry. Dumagueteños deserve a better place to live in where industries flourish and golden opportunities are equally shared and enjoyed by all.”<BR><BR>",

All nations were asked to devote some time to removing trash and garbage from coastal areas, including beaches, coastlines, rivers, estuaries, coastal wetlands, etc. <br><br>This day is a very appropriate and timely reminder of what every Filipino should do everyday to keep our surroundings free of unsightly scenery and potentially dangerous areas, thus making our country a healthful place to live. <br><br>In the Philippines, the Department of Environment leads in the cleanup activities on this day, with the participation of various government offices, schools, and civic organizations. It is hoped that this exercise ultimately becomes an everyday routine for all of us, and Sept. 25 becomes primarily a day of reflection on the significance of a clean and safe environment, not merely the actual cleaning up process. <br><br>In this connection, the environmental education process could begin with schools, colleges, and universities as part of the practical academic work of students at all levels of the education hierarchy. <br><br>This way, environmental education is integrated into the curricula, and with continuous practice becomes part of our responsibility as individual human beings. If other countries can do it, why can’t we do it? Why can’t we develop the habit of cleaning our surroundings? <br><br>Let’s begin in our homes by seeing to it that we do not litter our streets with trash and garbage. To cite an example: among the most common items lying around us are the non-biodegradable plastic materials. Why don’t we stop using plastics and shift to other materials that are easily degraded, such as paper and buri or pandan bags? <br><br>I do not need to emphasize the harm done by plastics, which clog drainage canals causing floods, poison or kill wildlife when ingested, create ugly scenery in public places, and provide breeding spaces for harmful microorganisms.  <br>  <br>Let’s not forget at this time that our country suffers from another serious pollution that we ourselves produce—kitchen, laundry, and toilet solid and liquid wastes— which are disposed of in our backyards. <br><br>Practically all of us are guilty of this negligence. But we must realize that these wastes are going to affect us sooner or later, through the food chain,  the air we breathe,  the water we drink, the flood waters we wade in. <br><br>I was struck by the cleanliness of the East River in New York City during my recent visit there. With the several millions of people living in New York City, it is amazing that the water of this river has remained very clear and relatively clean. <br><br>Contrast this with the dirty, stinking esteros of Metro Manila, and the dirty drainage canals every where in the country! <br><br>And one can only ask: Why?<br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Doctors from the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital, even the retired, Dr. Filemon Flores , Dr. Nerves, Dr. Remoto,  and their  younger colleagues, have also made this event their own personal commitment. <br><br>Optometists Dr. Boy and Inday Santillan, Dr. Justino Kho  and his Dental Association friends, have extended their unselfish service for the past many years,  and  to all those who are involved, please know that we are truly grateful. <br><br>Mayor Lawrence Limkaichong and spouse Cong. Jocelyn Limkaichong  were invited to  attend, although they needed no invitation, as they have given their support in the previous medical missions over the years. <br><br>Such is the spirit of service, it is indeed “in giving that we receive”, and this spirit runs through the fiber of all those who have dedicated their spare time in the service of others. <br><br>This week, President Nehru, Past Presidents  Annie Pinero,  Lito Ramada, and Jun Sy took their time to distribute the donated Books Across the Seas to barangay high schools in Nagbalaye, Sta. Catalina, Bacong, and in Valencia, together with Rotarian Mayor Ricky Gonzalez. <br><br>Over lunch, the big boys simply recalled their innocent childhoods, making toys out of coconut leaves, taking  a neighbor’s green starapples or mangoes by stoning, the simple pleasures of   swimming in the river, playing tubig-tubig under the moonlight. <br><br>These childhood memories are precious, as their simplicity molded these men and their values of service. They collectively believe that whatever achievements they may have now, and their spirit to share can simply be traced to these roots.  <br><br>Nowadays, childhood is more complicated, anchored on TV, i-Pod, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, the Internet, and the malls- and it is amazing how children have to adapt to a global environment through the web. <br><br>However, more than ever, all the people of the world are interconnected, and any local event may impact the world, by a flick of the mouse. <br><br>This is why the song which we used to sing with my brothers in the DeMolays and sisters in Job’s Daughters is apt: “If more people were for people, all people everywhere, there’ll be a lot less people to worry about, and a lot more people who care!” <br><br>Yes, let us all care and share even in our own little way,  and multiplied many times over, we can make a difference. And in Texas, we say: “Bless your heart, you all!” <br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

But never this close up.  These are the faces of statues- the nuns on the boulevard, part of the painted cement monument to the boatload of Sisters who landed on a beach here in 1904 to help found St. Paul’s University. They don’t look very happy to be here.<br><br>In 1900, Negros, including Dumaguete, was a quiet, remote colony of Spain, ruled over spiritually by the official Catholic church, and governed by a group of local “Hancienderos” with dubious claims to pure Spanish Blood. <br><br>But in 1904, Dumaguete was in turmoil. After losing a short war, Spain waved goodbye and walked away –leaving  the Philippines, including Negros, in the hands of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Americans</span>- a strange group of people whom no one knew much about, except that they spoke English and were mostly <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Protestants</span> -- Heretics! <br><br>To make matters worse, a large tract of land in Dumaguete had been taken over by a group of these  American Protestants, who established a school on it called Silliman, including- <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a Protestant chapel</span>. This so enraged the  local priests and bishops that they even threatened to excommunicate anyone attending the American school.<br><br>But to no avail. The Hacienderos, who were used to sending their children to college in Manila, were happy to send them now to Silliman instead- it was closer, it was cheaper -- plus, it was American; and it never hurts to make friends with your rulers.<br><br>Having failed to frighten people away from Silliman, the church leaders decided to compete with it; to offer a “Proper Catholic Education”, as an alternative. So they enlisted a teaching order of Sisters in Cebu, found needed land, and founded St. Paul’s. -And it still thrives today, an excellent university in this University Town. <br><br>It has been more than a century since the Sisters landed on the beach in Dumaguete. From the way these statues represent them, they must have had a hard time getting here. There is little joy in these painted faces as they come to assume their new duties.<br><br>The young Sister above looks just faintly puzzled; the mother superior below looks actually seasick. Their hands are raised to the sky; to offer thanks -- or only to test the wind? It’s hard to say. If they are really thankful, it’s probably because they will soon be off that boat. <br><br><img \"align=\"LEFT\"\" src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport10-3.jpeg\" border=\"0\"><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The winners, dancers from the towns themselves and not among the university students, were then sent to Manila to compete in the National Folk Arts Festival. <br><br>Some of the early participants were dancers from Zambuanguita with their local dance<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Polka Bianna,  Inagta</span> of Siaton, and the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kasalan</span> of Dauin. The first winner was Siaton. <br><br>The Buglasan continued to grow as more towns joined the festivities triggered by the success of the participants who won 1st runner up in the NFAF in 1982, and the transfer of the venue of the competition from the FU campus to the Quezon Park. <br><br>Because of the political turmoil in the mid-80s and climaxing in the assassination of Ninoy Aquino, the Buglasan was suspended. However in 1995, it was revived to insure the participation of Negros Oriental in the World Tourism Month. <br><br>In 2000, the Buglasan was given its present designation as the “Festival of Festivals.” Subsequently in 2002, the Sagguniang Panlalawigan passed Ordinance No. 15 proclaiming the Buglasan Festival as the annual provincial fiesta celebration. From 2003 until now, the Buglasan Festival is celebrated in October. On Oct. 14, 2005, then President Gloria Arroyo formally declared the third Friday of October as Buglasan Day, making it a special holiday for Negros Oriental. <br><br>The Buglasan, by this time, has grown too big for Foundation University to handle. Thus, on Oct. 13, 2006, a historic passing of the torch, so to speak, was held at the Capitol Grounds. <br><br>The following account of the ceremony is told by blogger Aiken Emmanuel G. Quipot:  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Gov. George Arnaiz accepted the Buglasan icon from Foundation University (President Mira D. Sinco) saying, ‘We are pleased to receive this Buglasan icon from Foundation University, where our Provincial Festival was born 25 years ago. With this symbol, a legacy formally passes from your institution to the people of Oriental Negros. The Buglasan Festival has become a precious part of our heritage, one that we are proud to call our own. Buglasan has come to define and reinforce the cultural character of our province. With the Buglasan Festival, we have found a special event that involves us all in vibrant collaboration and warm fellowship. Thank you very much, Foundation University.”</span> <br><br>In 2008 and 2009, Foundation University attempted, without success, to get involved in the celebration of the Buglasan by offering to stage a marathon race because of its potential to lure the participation of tourists. This year was more fruitful as the Buglasan Committee approved the staging of the following events as part of the official schedule: <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Sunday, Oct. 10 – The Robinsons Buglasan Quarter Marathon Wellness Walk (QMWW)</span>. Wellness and physical fitness enthusiasts take up walking as a form of exercise, and as an excellent means to explore and get to know the nooks and corners of a place that one happens to visit. It is for this reason that this event will be held to jumpstart the Buglasan festivities. <br><br>The QMWW was first held last year as a requirement for PE 1 at FU, Foundations of Physical Fitness classes. When a wellness survey of entering freshman students showed that about half of them exhibited “health risks” attributed to a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating habits, the FU administration decided to adopt walking as a form of exercise that could be used as a preventive measure against these health risks manifested by the students. The walking and completion of the full distance of the 10.5 km. QMWW in PE is now a requirement for graduation. <br><br>The challenge of the QMWW has intrigued and challenged many who undertake a physical fitness training program, that we decided to institutionalize it as a regular wellness activity and invite everybody to join us.  <br><br>It involves walking 15 rounds around the Robinsons grounds. The walk, depending on the rate of walking, may take an hour or two, to complete. The starting gun fires off at exactly 6 in the morning; water stations are available to insure that walkers will be adequately hydrated; and walkers may stop and rest anytime—precautions adopted so they will not experience any discomfort associated with heat stress. <br><br>Certificates of achievement and an abaca bracelet crafted by FU CWTS will be awarded to all walkers who will complete the QMWW. After all, it is not everyday that one gets to walk the distance of 10.5 kilometers, the equivalent to walking all the way from the Capitol Area grounds to the Sibulan Church, and back to the City. <br><br>Quite a feat for everybody to experience and achieve. But its can be safely undertaken with adequate water, music, and bands playing for entertainment, and in the company of some 800 FU students, faculty, and staff. <br><br>We invite fitness and wellness enthusiasts in the University Town to join this fun-filled QMWW. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Sunday, Oct.17 – The Buglasan Duathlon and Road Races</span>. The duathlon is a sporting event for mountain bikers who compete in a run- bike-run race. <br><br>For this Buglasan adventure duathlon, the competitors will initially run five kilometers (seven laps around the Robinsons Mall), mount their bikes and pedal 34 kilometers along Dumaguete streets and off-roads in the municipalities of Sibulan and Valencia, then pedal back to Robinsons Mall, and finish off with another  three kilometers or four laps around the Robinsons Mall to cover a total of 42 kilometers. <br><br>An open quarter marathon (10.5k) road race, 5k finisher’s walk and race, and 3k children’s event will also be held. <br><br>The Buglasan Adventure Duathlon will, hopefully, become an integral part of the “Festival of Festivals” as it is being promoted by the Provincial Tourism Council. It is envisioned that next year, an adventure marathon will also complement the duathlon, and both events are anticipated to draw tourists from all part of the country, and internationally.  Some 20 sacks of rice donated by  the Provincial Tourism Council and OK Mart will be awarded to winners and participants. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Thursday, Oct. 21 - The Buglasan Children Rap & Hip-Hop Concert.</span> This is an exciting competition where young children and youth rappers will sing and dance their original composition on the theme extolling the natural beauty of Negros Oriental as a desirable and wholesome place to visit. <br><br>Parents and spectators will love this event as they will witness children and youth energetically exhibiting their creative talents in song and dance, and all for the love of Negros Oriental. Five sacks of rice, donated by the Provincial Tourism Council will be awarded to the winners and participants.<br><br>FU Community thanks the Buglasan Committee for this opportunity to be part of the “Festival of Festivals.” I would especially like to thank Dr. Nick Elman, chair of the Buglasan Festival Committee and the Negros Oriental Tourism Council for making FU’s ardent desire to be part of this annual celebration a reality. <br><br>Likewise, I would also like to thank Woodrow “RR” Maquiling Jr., Provincial Tourism officer, who assured us of 15 sacks of rice that will be awarded to the participants. Interested mountain bikers and fitness walkers my contact landline (035) 422-9167, locals 165 (Paul/Hope), 113 (Olive), for further information. <br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Catalina, and La Libertad have received grants for forest management and have started working on their respective  projects. <br><br>“The project provides ground for reforestation and reduction of soil erosion. And DED will plan, sustain and monitor the strong forest management project,” Wilhelm added. <br><br>He said the group puts premium on environmental issues. “It is necessary to bring young people to the attention that it is a surviving aspect to take care of the environment. It does not start in the university, [among] adults and NGOs. It should start in kindergarten,” he continued. <br><br>“As in development cooperation, you always campaign a very modest contribution-to want the country itself and the citizens themselves to solve the problems. They have to tackle the problems in a positive-constructive way not only because it is a global challenge but because it is also a challenge for themselves,” he added. <br><br>On the question of governance, Wilhelm said: “The Philippines needs to implement effective policy against corruption. Accountability is important towards achieving the MDGs . . . . Development and progress cannot be achieved unless there is also economic development,” he explained. <br><br>“It is also profitable for each and every citizen of the government to take care, be productive, to find solutions in a positive way and to do all these in a democratic and a peaceful framework,” Wilhelm footnoted his speech. <br><br>The German Development Services is one of the leading European services for sending development workers abroad. It was founded in 1963 as a non-profit-making. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">(Kathyrine Mercado/SU Masscom) </span><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

In Dumaguete City, where even well-to-do people have taken to driving motorcycles to beat the traffic and parking problems also swear by this two-wheeled contraption and ditch the helmet.<br><br>You may have as many reasons for not wearing a helmet as you have motorists in Dumaguete. Some would argue that the non-imposition of this law is easy to condone because no one else is endangered by a helmet-less rider; he only endangers himself. <br><br>Another reason is that most crimes involving extra-judicial killings involve motorcycle-riding gunmen who almost always wore a helmet to avoid detection. Besides, anywhere is five minutes away in Dumaguete. It would take more time to put on and remove a helmet than to get to one's destination. <br><br>Another reason for not requiring helmets is that this is just an additional burden for the poor. Well, who can argue against one who is on the side of the poor? We've heard these justifications before: Majority wins.

Not Talisay City Mayor Socrates Fernandez’s  son Joavan. He scuffles with anti-narcotic agents, court officials, cops  or neighbors. He <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">wang-wangs</span>  from his Civic Honda with impunity. <br><br>The UN Commission on Human Rights cobbled  a 54-word definition of impunity. Your dictionary uses three:  “Exemption from punishment.”  <br><br>About  97 percent for those who murdered  newsmen  evaded  conviction. <br><br>The UN  and  the Asian Institute of Journalism & Communication seek a “new  multi-disciplinary approach” to the body count. The Philippines, Iraq,  and  Somalia top  the  2010 Impunity Index  operated by  the Committee to Protect Journalists. <br><br>The Index monitors  trends, in countries, where journalists are serially rubbed  out, as law enforcers falter. “Two of the world’s worst offenders are Russia and the Philippines,” CPJ asserts. <br><br>Others  in the  Index are  Afghanistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and  Pakistan. ”Many present themselves as democracies with functioning law enforcement, e.g. India, Russia, and the Philippines. <br><br>“Impunity is having a broader effect, “CPJ points out. (It) effectively chokes  off the flow of  information. Many Sri Lankan journalists fled into exile lest they be targeted.  <br><br>Self-censorship, in Mexico, is so widespread  major events go uncovered. Filipino newsmen, who reside in political warlord dominated provinces, play it safe. They flag controversial reports to  metro-based colleagues.<br> <br>Why are newsmen targeted?, sociologists, political scientists to psychiatrists asked  at AIJC  roundtables  in  San Juan, Cebu City, and  General Santos City.  Why are these slayings rarely solved?  Why is there no public outcry? <br><br>The Center for Media Freedom & Responsibility research  into salvaging of newsmen started in 1991. The first reports of  rubouts  trickled  in then. CMFR probed 32 murders  since the 1986  People Power scrapped Marcos censorship. <br><br>“The Center found 22 were  killed in the line of duty. (There was) great variance of motives and perpetrators: … Post-Marcos  regimes were  saddled with a politicized military,  police and judicial institutions. Add to this weaknesses of law enforcement agencies, corruption and lack of capacity for forensic investigation. <br><br>Many victims  were broadcasters in  the provinces. A number  had hazy “blocktimer” credentials. CMFR  then “did not find evidence of a pattern involving government officials…” <br><br>But this changed over time. CMFR noted a “remarkable spike” under President Arroyo. Out of 117 journalists killings, 79 occurred during her watch. <br><br>The  Ampatuan town massacre (catapulted) “ the country from sixth to third on the Index,” CPJ  stated. “The massacre overshadowed gains that Philippine authorities made, winning convictions in two journalist murders.” <br><br>Extra-judicial killings include student activist, peasant leaders, politicians, even “commissars” in the local communist pogroms, UN special rapporteur Philip Alston wrote. “Given covert official  backing and citizen complacency, as in Davao and Cebu,  death squads operate with impunity.” <br><br>A killing costs about P5,000 (roughly US$100)…. Many occur  in “in broad daylight”. “Witnesses are not prepared to testify.”(Impunity) encouraged death squad killings to spread. <br><br>A culture of impunity builds up incrementally.The Philippines waffled on who collaborated with World War II Japanese occupiers. This smudged the difference between Quislings and resistance, historian Frank Golay notes. <br><br>None  were held accountable for the 3,257 salvaging victims and 70,000 prisoners of the “New Society”.

It  sketches  how the dark underworld of crime, subversion, vice, and drugs here is linked to the bright, public world of politics, Ateneo sociologist John Carroll  notes. That’d provide further input for the UN-AIJC  series).<br><br>Examples of  impunity guarantee  repeat of abuse.  <br><br>In 2003, Justice Renato Corona wrote for the Supreme Court : The Marcoses’ Swiss bank accounts (and) foreign foundation were set up to conceal the illegally-acquired funds of the Marcos spouses. [They] failed to justify the lawful nature of their acquisition of the said assets.” No punishment, however,  was meted. <br><br>Down the road, did that spur Gloria Macapagal  Arroyo to shred the plunder conviction of  ex-president   Joseph Estrada? Does one pardon deserve another? <br><br>“For all the trappings of a national government…we conduct our affairs pretty much in the manner of Lapu-Lapu and Humabon,” the late historian Horacio de la Costa once mused. “(Today’s) congressman who moves around with bodyguards is not much different from the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">datu</span> surrounded by his retainers.” <br><br>Thus, many see the  Ampatuan massacre trial as just another case, albeit at  a monstrous scale. Still at  large are 130 suspects. But it is more. <br><br>In the dock is a centuries-old system of impunity crafted by the powerful and moneyed.  Judge  Jocelyn Solis- Reyes’  decision will affect our grandchildren’s future. <br><br>As that Civic Honda’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">wang-wang</span> proclaims: Impunity can gouge out the eyes of a nation.<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Since the Philippine National Oil Company-EDC operations and the National Power Corporation power plant were privatized, Napocor, which had a contract to supply power to Noreco 1 and 2, had to look elsewhere for power. That meant getting power from faraway Tongonan, Leyte. At times, from its geothermal plants in Sorsogon.{{more}}<BR><BR>This setup has also brought some problems to Negros Oriental power consumers, like low voltage, which has been blamed for destroying several electrical appliances and electricity-run mechanical devices.<BR><BR>But Green Core Geothermal, Inc., the new operator of the Palinpinon Geothermal Plant, is in the thick of negoatiations with the two Norecos, seeking to bag a contract seeking to supply power to Negros Oriental before the Noreco contracts with Napocor end in December.<BR><BR>\"We are sincerely hoping that Noreco 1 & 2 will also sign a Power Supply Agreement (PSA) with GCGI so we can begin supplying power to Dumaguete,\" said Frances Ariola, corporate communications officer of the Energy Development Corporation, the parent company of Green Core. \"The power we are offering to your cooperatives is the best option for Negros,\" Ariola added in a statement to the Dumaguete MetroPost.<BR> <BR>Both sides are locked on the issue of pricing. The two Norecos want to buy geothermal power at P3.50 per kilowatt-hour which Green Core is selling at P4.70. <BR><BR>For now, however, time is not on Noreco's side. Green Core has been entering into PSAs with the provinces of Capiz, Iloilo and Aklan, who now stand to benefit from clean and affordable power for the next 12 years. <BR><BR>Power companies in Cebu are also reportedly waiting for Green Core's decision to sell them whatever quantity they could get. But Ricky Tantoco, EDC president and COO, said they want to offer Negros Oriental consumers a chance to buy the power that is generated from their own province. <BR><BR>The three Panay provinces are getting a total of 40 MW from GGCI.

As the crowd filled the hall, it was obvious that there were as many Filipinos as there were Americans—a lively, congenial blend of two cultures gathered to celebrate something they had in common and someone they both held dear.{{more}}<br><br>The special guest for the September 22 affair was His Excellency Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III, president of the Republic of the Philippines, who was conferred the College of Mount Saint Vincent's highest honor, the Elizabeth Seton Medal, in a ceremony attended by CMSV trustees, faculty, alumni, students and the community. The award, named after the native New Yorker, saint and founder of the Sisters of Charity, is given in recognition of outstanding achievements, generosity of spirit and extraordinary self-sacrifice.<br><br>In his citation, CMSV President Charles L. Flynn Jr. extolled Aquino’s extraordinary achievements. Flynn said, \"In public service, as member of the House of Representatives, as senator and now as president, you have worked to secure democracy and the rule of law and to ensure clean, effective, efficient government.” Flynn further noted that Aquino, in his inauguration last June, pledged to be “champion of the impoverished” and reminded every democratic soul that it is a “duty to lift the nation from poverty through honest, effective government.”<br><br>The Philippine president is not unfamiliar to CMSV. This was the alma mater of his mother, the late former President Corazon Cojuangco Aquino. Dr. Flynn beamed, “This college took special pride in your mother. She is our most illustrious alumna and was by any measure extraordinary.” And for her courage and sacrifice to restore democracy to the Philippines, CMSV conferred the Elizabeth Seton Medal on her 24 years ago.<br><br>Joan Klintworth Walsh of North Riverdale remembers it very well. \"I was here when CMSV conferred the award on Corazon (Cory) Aquino on September 21, 1986. I knew her from college. I was two years ahead, but we knew each other very well.” Besides, Joan has a special affinity to the Philippines; her brother, Rev. William Klintworth, S.J., has long been teaching theology at Xavier University in Cagayan de Oro City.<br><br>Other classmates and contemporaries of Cory Aquino were also present, and spoke fondly of her. Helen Lovell and Kathleen Delaney Schafer remember Cory Aquino as a student in the early 1950s: “She would introduce Filipino songs and dances to us, especially the bamboo dance (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">tinikling</span>), which we found fascinating.”<br><br>At her conferral in 1986, the College established the Corazon C. Aquino Scholarship, which would offer two full-tuition scholarships per year to high-achieving incoming students of Filipino descent. Many Filipino students have availed of the opportunity since.<br><br>Philip Gerenia III finished Business Administration several years ago as an Aquino Scholar at CMSV. He looks back with gratefulness: “The scholarship was definitely helpful and gave me added appreciation for the value of good education and helped me understand more fully our responsibilities not only to ourselves and family but also to our community.”<br><br>Now gainfully employed in a prestigious accounting firm in New York City, Gerenia relished the chance to talk to Cory Aquino in one of her visits. He relates, “The college had a reception to honor her visit and several of the scholars were able to talk with her and express their gratitude to her and thanked her for being the inspiration that she was to many Filipino college students.”   <br><br>This year, at the conferral of President Benigno Aquino III, CMSV has announced that it is doubling the number of Aquino Scholarships offered.<br><br>This announcement was greeted with hearty applause from the Filipino-American students at CMSV, who have organized themselves under the name “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Samahan</span>” (Fellowship). It was also most welcome news to the Filipino community, one of the fastest-growing ethnic groups in Riverdale.<br><br>“There are many Filipino students here,” says Devonie Gail Manzano, a nursing student, and daughter of Onofre and Josephine Vidal-Manzano of Pamplona, Negros Oriental. “I have friends from all different backgrounds, but with my Filipino friends, it’s fun to speak Tagalog or Visaya, and share family stories. We perform in multi-cultural shows, and I’ve also served as Teacher’s Assistant in Filipino 101 class which helps improve students’ Tagalog and knowledge of Philippine history.”<br><br>According to CMSV, among the college’s diverse student population, approximately 9 percent of undergraduate students are Filipino-American. This is among the highest percentages for a college in the United States.<br><br>Angelique Calbitaza is one of the Aquino Scholars now enrolled at CMSV. She’s grateful for the scholarship because she is able to focus her time on school and doing well in class rather working just to pay for school. She was delighted to meet President Noynoy Aquino: “I was able to thank him for the scholarship… and promised I would aspire to be as kind and great as he and his mother.”<br><br>In summing up his citation, Dr. Flynn said, “Your Excellency, you are your parents’ son and thus a child of this college. We celebrate and honor you and, if indirectly, take some little tidbit of credit for the ideals you serve.”<br><br>Inspired by his parents’ remarkable lives and heroism, President Benigno Aquino III has taken up the cudgel to improve the economic, social and political life of his country. His prayer is for Filipinos to continue to enjoy the blessings of democracy and be finally free of poverty.<br><br>“A generation from now, perhaps another Filipino will stand here and say to you, 'I am glad to say that we remain not only free, but are now prosperous….' This is my prayer,” the president reflected.<br><br>In accepting the Elizabeth Seton Award, President Aquino remarked, “I am humbled by what this medal represents: your solidarity with my people. You stood with us in dark days. You stand with us now, in brighter days.”<br><br>Waving those two tiny U.S. and Philippine flags couldn’t have found more meaning in this coming together of two cultures, whose love of country is surpassed only by their love of God. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"></span><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

SRA Dungog and PO3 Paquea were able to grab the accused, who resisted his being held by the police officers.  <BR><BR>The court gave more weight to the testimonies of the buy-bust team, which established that an operation was legitimately and successfully carried out to entrap the accused Teves, who simply denied that he sold and delivered to a poseur-buyer shabu on that day. <BR><BR>The presumption of innocence accorded to the accused Teves had been overturned by the evidence presented by the prosecution.<BR>  <BR>Contrary to the assertion of Teves, the prosecution had convincingly proved beyond reasonable doubt that the crime charged was committed by Teves.  <BR><BR>The inability of Teves to predicate his defense on anything other than his words alone ultimately condemned him to prison, especially in the light of the prosecution’s evidence and witnesses, which he had been incapable of impeaching. <BR><BR>The Special Court for Drug Cases also sentenced Adam Cuevas and Kim Pinili to an indeterminate penalty of 12 years and one day as minimum term to 14 years maximum in jail for violating Section 11, Article II of R.A.

I decided to send it to one of Australia’s leading parenting magazine and they decided to pay me to print it. The piece became one of the articles with the most feedback. Who would’ve thought my little rant reached out to a lot of women in Australia? </span><br><br>Why do I feel useless even if I know I’m not? Why do I feel like I need to be earning to feel like I’m contributing to the household? Why do I have the urge to find something to earn from – anything, so I can feel like I have the right to spend? <br><br>I found these thoughts running through my head one day while tidying up the house yet again. <br><br>I know I am lucky. I am lucky to have a husband with a good income so that I can stay at home with my daughter. I am lucky that he doesn’t demand much from me. I am lucky that I have a healthy happy daughter. I am lucky that we have the means to meet our needs and more. I am lucky that I don’t have to work. <br><br>But my feelings betray me sometimes, and I suddenly feel the need to go online to find a part time role. Are women so ingrained to be earning that we feel useless when we’re not? Why do I get this feeling that I need to be earning? <br><br>I was washing dishes one day, and I thought to myself that most of the things I prepared for when I was younger are utterly useless in my current situation. I have a masters degree in communications, I have over 10 years of experience in the media industry both internationally and in Australia – some of my work were even published in the New York Times (and I was only 25!). <br><br>I used to rush to get on military choppers, to mingle with rebels, to cover bomb threats and disastrous fires. Now I’m washing dishes, vacuuming the house, doing the laundry, preparing baby food, and wiping baby bottom while ducking away from poo-covered little hands. <br><br>Don’t get me wrong, I actually am very happy with where I am now. I knit, I write, I take photos, I watch my favourite TV shows. I’m at home with my daughter, sharing in her adventure. You can’t pay me enough to go back to full time work (well, maybe you can but it will cost you an arm, a leg and a buttock). <br><br>I am grateful for the gifts I’ve been given, and I am aware there are mothers out there who wish they were in my situation (sometimes I find myself apologising for having it good). <br><br>But then there are moments when I see remnants of my past – a suit, an old payslip, a security pass, a pair of fancy heeled shoes – and I start to feel useless. I hear the comments of the earlier generation in my head, from the time when stay-at-home mums were still generally found non-contributors to society. <br><br>“You’re just a housewife?” <br><br>“Don’t you have plans to go back to work?” <br><br>“What do you do all day then? Shop?” <br><br>“Stop spending your husband’s money.” <br><br>These nagging thoughts are compounded by the fact that there are a gazillion other stereotypes attached to my race (e.g. mail to order bride, domestic helper etc). <br><br>I came to this country because I fell in love with an Aussie. Had I not met him, I would have happily pursued my career in another country. I had a solid career plan before I met him and it took me all over the world. I tweaked that plan when I met him, and it’s been tweaked even more now that we have a daughter. And I have no regrets tweaking everything to include a happy a family life. <br><br>I’ve asked other mothers about this feeling of uselessness, and yes, they, too, suffer from it in silence. Others cope by not giving it much thought. Some go back to work and then regret missing out on their kid’s life. But no matter what solution they create, they always suffer in silence. <br><br>Well, I’ve had enough with being silent. I need to put it out there. I shouldn’t feel useless at all. I am busy every single day, and I do contribute (yes, my husband says so, too, but my head refuses to believe him), and in a much bigger scale, the world will thank me for taking the time to mould my child. <br><br>I am useful. Yes, I am. <br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Or there was no honeymoon ever even for his first 100 days.  PNoy’s young administration is battered with two raging public controversies already-- for his publicly-declared support of the Reproductive Health Bill, and his crusade against jueteng. <br><br>On the RH Bill, the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines has stated that President Aquino risks excommunication if he actively promoted distribution of artifcial contraceptives to Filipino couples.  <br><br>CBCP President Bishop Nereo Odchimar said the President should consider the position of the Catholic Church because it is approaching the issue from the moral aspect. He argued that abortion is a grave crime.  That is an issue of gravity, that is a violation of God’s commandment. <br><br>In a rapidly-secularized society, the CBCP exhortation for morality is somewhat refreshing.  A muslim group, the Imam Council of the Philippines, is backing the Catholic Church in its fight against the passage of the RH Bill.  <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dura lex, sed lex.</span>  The law is harsh but it is the law.  In a multi-racial society where every group brings into the round table its respective belief system, everyone gravitates to the law as the ultimate provider of the standard norm of human behavior.  To stand steadfast on Christian values nurtured from the Words of God, therefore, is the demand of the moment. <br><br>President Aquino, however, remains firm in advocating for an informed choice on the issue of using artificial contraceptives in family planning and spacing among Filipino couples.  <br><br>He stressed the State’s duty is to educate  our families on their responsibilities and to respect their decisions. In espousing responsible parenthood, the President is open to the idea of using government resources to educate couples on both natural and artificial methods of birth control.  “We are all guided by our consciences,” PNoy declared. <br><br>The President’s predicament calls to mind King Canute.  Surfing the Internet,  I learned that he was the Danish King of England in 1017 best remembered for his vain attempt to stop the incoming tide.  <br><br>In reality though, it was the King’s way to cut the flattering courtiers down to size.  Flattery was his daily fare.  “You are the greatest man that ever lived.” “Your Highness, there is nothing you cannot do.”  “Nothing in this world dares to disobey you.” <br><br>One day, the King put the flatteries to a test.  He summoned his men and courtiers to bring his chair to the edge of the water by the sea.  As he sat down and surveyed the on rushing tide, he asked the courtiers, “Do you think the tide will stop if I give the command?” <br> <br>One replied with assurance, “Give the order, O great king, it will obey.”  <br><br>Even after King Canute decreed his command, the water rose higher and higher, the waves were rolling, and the surf kept on pounding.  The King’s robes got wet as the flatterers turned sheepish. <br><br>King Canute reminded them that there is only one King who is all powerful, ruling the sea, and holds the ocean in His hand.  He told them to reserve their praises for Him.  <br><br>The point here is not of critics and flatterers.  The point here is the limit of human law whether secular or of the church.  No one can legislate morality. No one can legislate to ensure good behavior. One can only legislate a law that serves to deter bad behavior for being inimical or disruptive to society.   <br><br>Being good and being right are functions of one’s love relationship with God. It is an exercise of one’s free will. The change is in the Inner Man irrespective of what are the outside stimuli and circumstances.  <br><br>The point here is to hold in every Filipino mind what is crystal-clear about the RH Bill: it is proposing to educate the Filipinos on the use of artificial contraceptives in family planning and spacing.  <br><br>The Church is against such advocacy as it insists on the natural method of rhythm and abstinence.  <br><br>There is no provision in the bill that legalizes abortion. Equating the bill with abortion is only the fear of the conservative members of the church who brandish excommunication against President Aquino. <br><br>For all intent and purposes though, the education on the use of artificial contraceptives in the Philippines is already a done deal.  It started in the 1970s with the establishment of the Population Commission.  <br><br>Judging from the number of families embracing zero population growth, a majority of the Filipinos are no longer limiting themselves to the rhythm-and-abstinence rule.  <br><br>The conservatives may judge them to be anti-life by being pro-choice.  Curse or blessing, life or death. <br> <br>They choose blessing by making the right decision in ensuring a life abundant for a fewer number of children. <br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.”</span> <br><br>Our scripture reading narrates that Jesus had just come from across the Sea of Galilee when he was approached by a synagogue ruler by the name of Jairus whose little daughter was very sick at that time.  Jesus did not refuse Jairus because the Lord saw the sincerity and humility of Jairus who literally had to beg Jesus on bended knees to save his daughter’s life. <br><br>As Jesus and his disciples together with Jairus and his companions were making their way to Jairus’ house, crowds followed and pressed hard on them. The crowd control was extremely challenging. Everyone wanted to have a glimpse of this so called “miracle man”  from Nazareth.  What was his face like?  How did his voice sound? What clothes was he wearing? Where is he going this time? And why were Jairus and his companions moving along with him?  <br><br>The gospel writer mentions that part of that big crowd gathering around Jesus was a very, very sick woman.  She was suffering from a reproductive bleeding condition that caused her to suffer for 12 years.  <br><br>Many times during my nursing practice days, I would often come face to face with patients having these kinds of heart-breaking situations especially in government hospitals and public health care institutions.  Many of them come from the poorest of the poor.  And many of them really have no where to go.  <br><br>But the thing is, it does not have to be a physical illness or a health crisis all the time. There are many kinds of anguish and suffering that go deeper than the physical body. These are the pains of fathers and mothers who see the destructive ways of their own children; the pains of children and young people who are longing to be understood and loved by their parents who are too busy earning a living, or parents who are too demanding or hard to please; the anguish of being betrayed by people you trust at work or even in church; and even the pain and the fear of just realizing that at the end of the day, you are all alone. <br><br>The woman in our scripture reading today had hit rock-bottom. She was seriously ill. She had lost all her money to doctors who never got to cure her. And she was living a society that would never allow a sick person like her to live a normal life. <br><br>You see friends, there are many beautiful things that happen in our lives when the Lord permits us to hit rock bottom.  There are issues that become far clearer in our hearts when we no longer have anyone or anything to hold on to for security. There are truths in life we learn the best only when we are at our worst. There gifts and blessings that come to our lives only when we allow the Lord to have his full and complete way it us. <br><br>Sept 25 was the 8th birthday of our eldest son, Caris Samuel. Caris means “God’s gift.”  Samuel means, “Because we asked the Lord.”  <br><br>About a year and a half after my husband and I got married in 1999, we literally asked the Lord for a child.  Being a nurse, I was very confident of what I know medically about conception. But when it became difficult to conceive, I knew then there was something God was trying to say.  My husband and I eventually learned that I had a medical condition that prevented me from conceiving. My left and right ovaries both had cysts and the doctors explained that 95 percent of women who had that kind of condition could not have children.  <br><br>But certainly, the doctors presented some medical options we could take. The truth, however, was not we could never afford such procedure.  My husband and I said to each other, “We do not have the money for expensive treatments, but we have a God who makes all things possible.” <br><br>The moment the word was out to our family and friends, prayers started to pour in especially from members of the church.  <br><br>In six months, I conceived despite the presence of those cysts. When I tested positive using a home-pregnancy test kit, my doctor said, “Maam, don’t be too excited yet because we want to make sure that this is really true.” After another series of tests to confirm my pregnancy, the doctor finally said, “Maam, ma-suwerte po kayo!”  But I said, “Doctor, God is good.” <br><br>But more surprises awaited us. My pregnancy went on smoothly but on the day of my delivery, we were told that I needed emergency ceasarean section because my son got strangled by my umbilical cord. He almost lost his life.  The umbilical cord tightly coiled around his neck three times. Initially, the doctors were afraid that his brain may have been affected because of lack of proper oxygen supply.  His head was bigger than usual and he looked rather weak. But God was really good.  After a battery of tests, the doctors declared him fully normal and healthy. <br><br>Back to the day of my ceasarean section, after giving his written consent, my husband had also given a special request for the doctors to examine the cysts in both my ovaries.  Earlier on, I had been advised to have this surgically removed to prevent further complications. But the doctors were astonished to discover that the cysts on my left and right ovaries have both disappeared. This was medically confirmed later on when both my ovaries were declared healthy and fully normal after some series of tests.  <br><br>Our testimony was picked up by 700 Club Asia and has been televised internationally for the past five years especially when they have episodes on miracle healings. <br><br>Friends, the bleeding woman, despite her desperate situation, reached out to Jesus in sheer and desperate faith.  Jesus, upon feeling that touch, stopped and asked, “Who touched me?” The disciples must have been irritated by his question. There was a whole crowd surrounding him -- of course, many had touched the Lord.  But Jesus was insistent.  He said,  “I felt power come out of me, someone touched me.”  <br><br>The woman, knowing it was her, came to Jesus trembling.  She thought she would be arrested.  It was forbidden for a sick person to touch anyone.  But she was overtaken by the grace and goodness of Jesus who said to her the sweetest words anyone could hear, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.” <br><br>It’s amazing how Jesus responds to faith.  He stops.  He looks.  He listens.  He attends.  He responds with great love and enormous compassion. When we put our faith in him, he restores and works with great power -- amazingly and beyond what we can ever hope or imagine.  Thank you, Lord!<br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR> <BR>The Executive Legislative Agenda (ELA) held Sept. 23 to 25 in Boracay, which cost about P350,000 in expenses, is being considered by not a few as just another junket. <BR><BR>Nevertheless, initiators of the ELA believe it would pay excellent and fruitful dividends. <BR><BR>From the start, the plan to hold the ELA in the island of Boracay had been criticized by many in the corners of Dumaguete, saying it is too expensive, or why can’t we hold it here in the City and save money, or that there are other more pressing concerns that need immediate attention here at home such as the fight against the deadly dengue, etc. <BR><BR>Come to think of it. In school, various bachelor courses require exposure rips for the students to have more meaningful exchanges of ideas and deeper immersion in the larger community of their specialized field, considering the fact that there is no monopoly of ideas.  <BR><BR>Likewise, the two branches of government – the executive and legislative -- need to have an exchange of ideas and deeper insight on governance and public service in tune with the Divine will.  This is to achieve a divinely ordained purpose and dream of making the City, characterized as the “City of Gentle People”, conducive to living, industriously enhanced without jeopardizing the preservation of nature and the pulling out of opportunities equally shared by the constituents. <BR><BR>Earlier,  City Administrator William E. Ablong answered the question of the Lavisa expenditure to be incurred by the ELA saying that something like “it is more expensive if ignorance continues to dominate our being”.  Well said: the lack of knowledge in governance would make one counterproductive.  “Experience is the best teacher, but it’s also a tough and costly one.” <BR><BR>The ELA experience provides room for growth and improvement among the people in both branches of government. The holding of the ELA is so timely, pondering on the huge challenges the Dumaguete LGU is confronted with; considering that “experience is a short cut to learning.”<BR> <BR>City Mayor Manuel “Chiquiting” Sagarbarria disclosed that the ELA experience would bring a change in local governance, saying that the people of Dumaguete could now expect great changes in the delivery of public service. <BR><BR>Deliberations in the legislative council would not be meant to delay the delivery of services but for purposes of check and balance.  <BR><BR>“I am not God who could not commit errors, so I need good people around me to check our actuations and intentions,” Mayor Chiquiting said. <BR><BR>Suffice it to say that the ELA experience is not that expensive compared to trips made abroad but that it could surely intensifying tax collections in the City, and in effect, our dreams for a better Dumaguete might just come true. <BR><BR>And Dumaguete could at least be among the country’s Top Cities, the city we can be proud to call our own. <BR><BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "<BR>juanlmercado@gmail.com<BR><BR><BR>CEBU CITYâ€”Does the re-ignited Reproductive Health bill controversy shove us between â€œthe hard rock of Scylla and the whirlpool of Charybdisâ€ of Greek mythology?<BR><BR>On one side are pugnacious RH advocates. They scoff at the even nuanced support for the bill. Ricardo J. Romulo, who agrees with the billâ€™s thrust, cautions against Sections 17 and 21. Proposed criminal sanctions may impinge on religious freedoms.<BR><BR>A dialog between the President and Catholic bishops â€œerodes essence of the stateâ€, GendeRights Executive Director Clara Rita Padilla asserts. Isnâ€™t that a recycle of the old criticism lobbed against the Master? â€œYou talk to sinners.â€<BR><BR>Those whoâ€™d call down fire and brimstone are on the other side. Bishop Nereo Odchimar denies he threatened to excommunicate President Benigno Aquino for supporting broader family planning choices. â€œMan does not live by words alone, although he sometimes must swallow them,â€ cracked the late Adlai Stevenson.<BR><BR>The regional Sun Star Daily reminded the shepherds : â€œExcommunication is to be used with sobriety and circumspection.â€ The Trent Council of 1563 cautioned: â€œIf wielded rashly, it is more despised than feared, and works more evil than good.â€<BR><BR>Yet, the common ground of advocates and critics is far broader than their fiery rhetoric suggests.<BR><BR>Take the headcount. Congress funded the last national census seven years late. Voting age cohorts are bloated in Maguindanao and other warlord dominated places. Population surged in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. This contrasted markedly with a slow decline elsewhere.<BR><BR>How many of us were here when P-Noy took his oath as president? Depends on who you ask.<BR><BR>The National Statistics Office swears there were 94.01 million Filipinos then. Really? U.S. offices estimate 97.9 million. UN lobs a question in reply: â€œWhich projections do you use? Low, medium or high?â€<BR><BR>The NSO estimate, in any case, equals 13 Hong Kongs, population-wise.Thatâ€™s five times the pre-World War II headcount. Nor is that a neat antiseptic figure. Out of every 100 Filipinos, 44 scrape by on P100 a day.<BR><BR>The country whittled down poverty incidence from a high of 30 percent in the early 1990s. But the global food and fuel crises, plus population surges, â€œpushed even more people into penuryâ€. We ignore Aristotleâ€™s caution at our peril: â€œPoverty is the parent of rebellion and crime.â€<BR><BR>The momentum of population growth ignores presidents, bishops, and congressmen. It persists long after brakes are pulled. Computers are still crunching the 2010 census returns, amidst murmurs of undercounts. But all brace for a larger population.<BR><BR>No one disputes the â€œyouth bulgeâ€. Majority of Filipinos are young. With hormones in overdrive, many start families early, despite marriage codes that jack up minimum age. They tarry in reproductive years longer.<BR><BR>All camps here recoil from abortion. Human life is precious. Lacking access to information and family planning services, nearly 473,000 Filipinas opted for underground abortions,â€ notes the United Nations Childrenâ€™s Fund. Illegal clinics and hilot ply a lucrative sub-rosa trade.<BR><BR>Do abortions now exceed half a million? There is no reliable tally in this murky underworld. But all agree women must be helped to become informed and speak for themselves. Continued neglect would â€œabet the terrible reality of abortion as the only viable choice open to poor Filipino women.â€<BR><BR>Couples must make family size decisions responsibly and freely, Pope John Paul II stressed. The Catholic Bishopsâ€™ 2nd Plenary Council, taught: Parents should â€œbeget only those children they can raise up in a truly human and Christian way. The decision on number of children rests solely with parents.â€<BR><BR>â€œIt is legitimate for government to orient the demography of population,â€ the Catholic catechism says. It can do so by information, but not by coercion or â€œmeans contrary to moral lawâ€.<BR><BR>Frontier Mindanao dioceses â€” Ipil, Cagayan de Oro, Isabela (Basilan), Digos, and Cotabato support natural family planning programs. â€œWe must give an effective answer to the stark realities of unwanted pregnancies, abortions, and use of contraceptives.â€ Cagayan de Oroâ€™s Archbishop Antonio Ledesma says.<BR><BR>Could a compromise bill could prevent Filipinos being trapped â€œbetween the rock and the whirlpoolâ€? Yes, say business groups that met last November at the Asian Institute of Management.<BR><BR>The conference excluded legislators for or against the RH bill. Instead, Management Association of the Philippines, the Makati Business Club, and the Bishops-Businessmenâ€™s Conference for Human Development dialoged with stakeholders: from NGOs, academics, to church and business.<BR><BR>A wide range of views were heard: from population programs being an â€œimperialist plotâ€ to government being able to accomplish the demographic objectives, even without the bill. The final consensus: the problemâ€™s urgency demanded business sector help to find a solution.<BR><BR>The President and the Catholic bishops are to dialog. That should help the country step back from a â€œhard rock of Scylla or whirlpool of Charybdisâ€ choices. All agree the cascade of ill-nourished babies from wizened mothers into sentences of life-long poverty is a prescription for disaster.<BR><BR>Realism must temper hopes. Whatever decisions the President or the bishops reach, the sheer momentum of human fecundity guarantees the addition of a 12-million Metro Manila to the countryâ€™s headcount by 2016. Thatâ€™s also when PNoy steps down from Malacanang.<BR><BR><BR>",

Instead of showing a subject isolated against a white wall, it shows a person immersed in his normal surroundings. The idea is that you can see more of who a person really is, by seeing where he is and whatâ€™s around him there. In this case heâ€™s sitting by a native house in a poor neighborhood, surrounded by bamboo walls and sunlight.<BR><BR>He seems alive and vibrant. He may be poor, but heâ€™s got a certain sense of style â€“ the sunglasses, the stainless watch, the Nike emblem hanging around his neck, the earring; as though he wanted to stand out from his surroundings, to be noticed as someone special. With the afternoon sun streaking across him from the bamboo slats above his head itâ€™s a nice picture, well balanced.<BR><BR>As to the boy himself, I never knew him very well and heâ€™s dead now. He was just the friend of another friend of mine, somebody who passed by from time to time. He was fun to be around, always joking, sharing local gossip, having a beer or two. He had a reputation as a â€œchicks boyâ€ and I guess it was true â€“ he would sometimes wave at me in passing from his motorcycleand there was always a pretty girl riding behind him, never the same girl twice.<BR><BR>Later on, he didnâ€™t come around much any more but I still heard about him from time to time. I heard his parents fought him or each other, somebody called the police. I heard he was doing a lot of drugs, and then selling drugs. I heard he got involved in some minor hold-ups. I heard he got crazy laughing in a billiard room and started throwing billiard balls at everyone and got locked up overnight. But whenever he passed by, he always smiled and waved and seemed exactly the same as always.<BR><BR>Finally I heard he got some girl pregnant and married her and settled down.

However, our response did not go for naught as we may have learned a thing or two from that incident. We may have some of the best-trained bomb disposal personnel around. But sending them to an area where there is a bomb threat armed only with a stick and with no body armor is literally putting them in harm's way.<BR><BR>Our bomb disposal squad would need a bomb-sniffing dog. It's been said that it costs over P1 million to train and maintain a dog to sniff for bombs.<BR><BR>Thankfully, there are a few trained dogs in Dumaguete whose services may be rented, but it seems like no dog was used in Thursday's bomb scare.<BR><BR>We also need to improve on our information dissemination. With only 20 minutes to react, the warning has to be out instantly. The challenge is how to spread the word without causing panic.<BR><BR>The Dumaguete reporters who covered the incident should also be commended for their professional handling of the incident. Unlike their counterparts in Manila who covered the tragic hostage-taking incident and who delivered a blow-by-blow account of the event, our journalists intentionally screened the information, putting out as little as possible to prevent panic among the parents and school children.<BR><BR>At most, the incident served as a reality check. We cannot really be complacent about our security in Dumaguete, even as we think of ourselves as a peace-loving people. There may be some elements who simply want to sow terror, which is not unheard of in some parts of the country. As such, security should be paramount on everyone's minds.<BR><BR>",

She was the lone girl player, looking chic and fashionable with all the prescribed gears for football: football shoes, shin guards, socks, shorts and shirt. I was completely fascinated by the sight of a girl, pigtails flying, scrambling, tackling, dribbling the football, unmindful that she was the only girl in the playing court. I tried to recruit this girl to come to Foundation University, and serve as an inspiration for others so that we could have more elementary girls playing football. But the father said that she is currently studying at the Tanjay Central School and transferring to FU would pose some inconveniences that the family is not prepared to face.<br><br>Currently, FU has two girls playing in the grade school boys football team. They are Jumawan, Mikhaela G. Torres, Krisha Cleire Marei C.<br><br>Mikhaela Jumawan and Krisha Torres, both 11-years old and in grade V. FU president, Dr. Mira D. Sinco, wrote City Schools Supt. Dr. Profetiza Lim to allow Michaela to play in the boys' football competition in the Dumaguete City Division Meet scheduled on Oct. 14-17. We hope that Dr. Lim will approve the request, and in doing so, she will go down in the history of the Palarong Pambansa as the first enlightened school official of the DepEd who supports mixed-gender sports in the annual school games.<br><br>Two weeks ago, I emailed former Chairman of the Philippine Sports Commission, Dr. Philip Ella Juico, to ask him to write on the subject of mixed-gender sports. Here are excerpts from his column appearing in the PhilStar last Oct 6 entitled: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"Mixed-gender sport in the Palarong Pambansa.\"</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"There is no doubt that we ought to emphasize gender equity (which connotes justice)/ gender equality (which connotes sameness of opportunities) for the simple reason that women are human beings and human resources who make up half the world's population.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"According to the Hunger Project, women bear almost all responsibility for meeting basic needs of the family, yet are systematically denied the resources, information and freedom of action they need to fulfill this responsibility.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"The vast majority of the world's poor are women. Two-thirds of the world's illiterates are female. Of the millions of school age children not in school, the majority are girls.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"The contribution of women to society's development has been amply demonstrated. Studies show that when women are supported and empowered, all society benefit. Their families are healthier, more children go to school, agricultural productivity improves and incomes increase. In short, communities become more resilient. And the earlier society supports and empowers women, when they are still girls, the better will they be prepared to assume responsibility as partners in development when they mature.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"With the above as the basic premise, it is not therefore very difficult to come out in full support of the proposal made by some forward-looking sectors to promote mixed-gender (boys and girls compete side by side as teammates or against each other) in children sports to open up more opportunities for girls to participate in sports which is consistent with the United Nations Rights of the Child.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"The DepEd Palaro Board may wish to consider mixed-gender in sports like football, volleyball, sipa and Little League baseball, as is already being done in many countries. In fact the Britons, through the Bristol Open, which is one of the United Kingdom's leading Sport Martial Arts competitions, allows boys to compete against girls.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"The 2010 Singapore Youth Olympic Games (YOG) also blazed the trail when the swimming events in the YOG featured a mixed gender event for the 4X100m freestyle relay and the 4X100m medley relay. It is to be noted that swimming was in the first modern Olympics in Athens in 1896 and has since been included in every Games since then.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"Mixed-gender swimming was probably one of the reasons why the United States opted to participate in the YOG despite what they said was the lack of top caliber opposition and the fact that the YOG overlapped with the Pan American Games which the Americans consider a major event.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"Writer Braden Keith says that perhaps the most intriguing part of the attempt of Cornel Marculescu, FINA (world governing body for swimming) director general, to lure the Americans was the mixed-gender relay event which became a theme of the YOG. The relay had two male and two female swimmers per team.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"Probably the mixed relay can be something which may be of interest at the end of the day,\" Marculescu said according to Keith. \"It is a very good opportunity to test new ideas which after that may become an event in world championship or in the Olympic program.\" Lately, the ISU (governing body of figure and speed skating) announced that eight mixed-country multi-gender teams will compete for team awards at the 2012 Junior Olympic Winter Games.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">To achieve the mixed-gender ideal, certain changes in mind set have to take place. One look at the Palaro events show very clearly that there are more boys than girls competing. If the change in mind set is achieved, children sports should have three categories: boys, girls and mixed-gender. Should mixed-gender be carried out, there will be a balance in the number of boys and girls who participate in the Palaro.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"The DepEd may do well to, at the very least, seriously study mixed-gender sport if only to make sports more egalitarian.\"</span><br><br>I reproduce the above for the benefit of the public school officials in our University Town, specifically to Provincial and City school superintendents Dr. Maria Milagaros Velez and Dr. Profetiza Lim, to gain the singular distinction of being the first in the in the entire DepEd bureaucracy to allow and authorize mixed-gender sports in the provincial and city division meets. As Juico said, it's all a question of \"changes in mind set.\"<br><br>Very soon, FU will launch an experiment in mixed-gender football. Competitions in elementary, secondary and open football, with 7 girls and 4 boys in a team, will be playing. FU is looking forward to the participation of Silliman University and Bacong, a football club that recently won both the elementary and secondary championship in the provincial division meet and will represent Negros Oriental in the Region 7 Palarong Pambansa. It should be an exciting experiment in children and youth sports.<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Then the announcement on news, the weather, and other alerts; people take it as part of the morning chat.<br><br>Overheard above the humdrum at the public market, government offices, or in the mall, people are trading numbers like it's everybody's business. People bet on their license plates, birthdays, or any number that they have pulled off their computed handouts. Almost everybody bets on the numbers game, and there are people who depend on the game for livelihood.<br><br>No one minded, nor appeared to be scared, and would even remind each other about the numbers game known as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">swertres</span> -- which is supposed to be illegal.<br><br>Firstly, any form of gambling is immoral. It preys on the most vulnerable, and kills the spirit of initiative, search for individual achievement, and capacity for hard work It feeds on the culture of fatalism in the Filipino psyche -- <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pagboot sa Dios</span> (God's will), or being resigned to one's destiny.<br><br>Every bet of P1.00 wins P400., and this chance of just hitting the winning number is too tempting to resist for the many who are barely earning the daily minimum wage rate.<br><br>This is where the immorality lies -- it is the poor who have better uses for their money: food, education for their children, etc., they are stuck in dire poverty because for every win, they have lost a lot more. But the lure of the lucky number is just too hard to resist.<br><br>Secondly, a gambler never quits while he is ahead; he always will try to recover his losses. There will come a time when the \"winner takes it all\" -- because the inveterate gambler will try to find money to bet in whatever way possible -- thus, the rise in crimes against property, stealing, bag grabbing, cellphone snatching, and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">akyat-bahay</span>.<br><br>Thirdly, people seem to think that if everybody does it, then it must be alright -- no harm done.

If no one is caught or if no one is looking, life goes on.<br><br>It is hard to go against human nature- the expectancy of a \"big win\" is an obstacle that is very difficult to resist.<br><br>However, this is the role of schools, religions, and civil society to make a stand against the numbers game, it is time to hold discussion groups, and for the leaders and members of all religions to practice what they preach, or profess to believe.<br><br>Gambling is evil because it corrodes the moral fabric of a society. With the illegal numbers game is the existence of other illegal activities which operate with impunity as it will promote the \"new\" Golden Rule: He who has the gold makes the rules.<br><br>A basic concept to the existence of the illegal gambling business is that there will be no gambling, if there are no bettors, and that is the kicker.<br><br>Why is there illegal gambling? Because it is tolerated and openly supported by its betting public. Just say no to gambling!<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

It was probably esoteric until recently, but after Sunday’s (that’s the 10.10.10) day-tonight activities, people in Dumaguete, unless they were in a coma or glued to stupid-making TV shows, should have heard, and just maybe, understood, what 350 is about.<br><br>The figure “350” refers to the parts per million of carbon dioxide marked by scientists as the upper and safe limit of carbon concentration in the earth’s atmosphere.<br><br>We’ve gone beyond it! The current status is 392 ppm. But like people who’re over their ideal weight or blood sugar count, measures can be taken to reduce the problems.<br><br>However, time is of the essence and since our public officials have mostly been cataleptic on environment issues, it is left to civil society, to pesky NGOs, to young people whose future is at stake, and to a very few eminent advocates, to make noise, stir up the waters, take to the streets, occupy public space, anything on 10.10.10 to get the urgent message across.<br><br>Urgent because at the rate we’re going, adding about two ppm every year, the dangerous threshold of 450 ppm will be reached that may mark the tipping point to irreversible climate changes and great unknowns for living things on this planet.<br><br>This isn’t just titillating doomsday talk, the science is there for those who care to know. Already, arctic ice melt, loss of permafrost, shrinking of high altitude glaciers, warming of the oceans, coral distress, and other signs are measurable.<br><br>The British scientist James Lovelock fears future famine, disease, wars for water, climate, and other disasters will decimate the world population.<br><br>The 350 campaign is about all the things that can be done to avert that, at private and public levels.<br><br>Here’s what our own local officials have not worked on, and please don’t accept lame excuses of “lack of resources” because wastage of public funds is evident everyday, and resources are not short for the meaningless merrymaking of fiestas and festivals, to name but the obvious.<br><br>We need non-polluting public transportation, energy-efficient public and private buildings, the use of renewable energy, urban greening, namely trees, to counter the heat of cemented streets and to sequester CO<sub>2</sub>, and when there is shade, the promotion of biking, real (as opposed to pretend) waste reduction programs that include the phase-out of plastics (other places have done it but we can’t?) – shopping bags, advertising tarps, bunting. Clean water supply so that so-called “mineral water” becomes unnecessary (polluting bottles!)<br><br>But what does it take? Political leaders with vision for the long-term (in very short supply in immediate past local administrations), creative political action, leaders who educate and inspire their constituents towards sometimes difficult change, passion for the tasks they set themselves.<br><br>Here’s something P-Noy has probably understood: a world population that rises by 78 million per year (the Philippines alone contributes nearly two million to that rise) is also doing the planet in.<br><br>Each and every human being has a “carbon footprint” and the cumulative effect contributes to climate change that will hurt the poorest countries most because there won’t be resources to rescue, resettle, feed, heal the most vulnerable, reconfigure economies.<br><br>And women need compassionate policies and programs on family planning. Where’s our local population policy that strongly supports women and men’s ability to responsibly plan family size? That’s a “350” response as well.<br><br>So folks, don’t drive when you can bike or walk, don’t accept plastic bags, take your own cloth or other re-usable shopping bag, use energy-saving light bulbs, plant trees, use your own water bottles, turn off lights when you don’t need, don’t burn leaves or other rubbish, cut down on chemically-grown food and chemically-raised food animals (better still, leave the poor critters off your dining table.) Get together with other people for joint action and to pressure government to shape up.<br><br>All do-able and painless. Be part of the “350” movement; the earth is too beautiful to ruin, the lives you save may be those of your own children and<br>grandchildren.<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Serranidae, and Carangidae, the biomass recovery period of time has been estimated at about 15 to 40 years, based on our 17 years of data (Russ and Alcala, 2004).<br><br>In the Philippines, the predatory reef fish species mentioned above and other Families, namely Acanthuridae, Scaridae, Labridae, Caesionidae, Siganidae and Haemulidae are considered target or food fishes.<br><br>Our underwater visual census of live fish individuals on coral reefs includes estimates of biomasses of species in these Families. Our data used in this presentation were gathered during the period of 26 years (1983-2009) mainly by my colleagues at SUAKCREM (Brian Stockwell, Jasper Maypa, Rene Abesamis) and at <a href=\"http://www.jcu.edu.au/\">James Cook University</a>, Townsville, Australia (<a href=\"http://www.jcu.edu.au/mtb/research/projects/JCUDEV_014226.html\">Garry Russ</a>).<br><br>This paper is an attempt to provide some tentative answers to the commonly asked questions: How long does it take for a depleted reef to recover its historical fish biomass? What is the status of the biomasses of these 10 or so Families on both fished reefs and protected reefs (no-take reserves)?<br><br>It is important to state at the outset that the baselines on target coral reef fish variables such as species richness, abundance, and biomass, are not exactly known. The famous fishery scientist, <a>Dr. Daniel Pauly</a> (1995), refers to this situation as the <a href=\"http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=daniel+pauly+shifting+baselines&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart\">\"shifting baseline syndrome of fisheries.\"</a><br><br>Despite this lack of baseline, let me suggest an estimate based partly on experience on diving on coral reefs from way from the late 1930s and early 1940s to the 2000s, and partly on estimates in the published literature in the 1940s to 1972.<br><br>The seven estimates in the literature from several reefs in the world varied: 10, 45, 50, 60, 100,155 210, all in kilograms/1,000 m<sup>2</sup> or tons/km<sup>2</sup>, depending on which kind of reef was surveyed.<br><br>The reef flats had low biomass (10 tons/km<sup>2</sup>) but the higher profile reefs ranged from 45 to 210 tons/ km<sup>2</sup>; the mean of these seven published estimates is 90 tons/km<sup>2</sup>, which may be adopted as the baseline for fish biomass in the 1930s and 1940s.<br><br>Those of us who have experience on a reef with a measured fish biomass of 90 tons will recognize that this biomass is characterized by a moderate darkening of the sea bottom when this volume of fish passes at noon of a sunny day.<br><br>A biomass of 150 tons at Tubbataha Reef in the Sulu Sea causes a marked darkening of the sea bottom at noontime. A reef with a fish biomass of 100-150 tons is no doubt an excellent reef.<br><br>This was the case of most remote coral reefs of the Philippines in the 1930s and the early 1940s. In the late 1940s and the 1950s, Philippine reefs began to slide downhill in terms of fish biomass and live coral cover.<br><br>When the concept of no-take marine reserves was first put into practice in the early 1970s, many reefs had already shown signs of overfishing. The fished portion (control sites) of Apo Island reef showed a trend of 20-40 tons/km<sup>2</sup>. But the adjacent no-take zone (marine reserve) of Apo Island Reef showed an increasing trend from about 15 to 100 tons/km<sup>2</sup> during the 14 yearly surveys from 1983-2002, showing without question that protection of the no-take reserve resulted in increased fish biomass to approximate the \"virgin\" biomass of 100-150 tons/km<sup>2</sup>.<br><br>One can see that the fished portion (85 percent of the total reef area) maintained a low fish biomass simply because it was fished continually. Our independent estimate of the fish removed was at least 15 tons every year from this fished area.<br><br>A later published paper showed that about 10 percent of the annual catch came from the reserve (spillover).<br><br>In 2002-2009, nine unprotected and fished reefs in the Visayas and elsewhere were surveyed at 14 different times with the underwater visual technique. The results showed biomasses of less than five to ca 40 tons/km<sup>2</sup>, but mostly at around 5-10 tons/ km<sup>2</sup>.<br><br>I suspect that our findings in the Visayas are also true of other marine areas in the other parts of the country if these areas were surveyed. (Incidentally, our findings are open for any interested person to examine, but I cannot release them because they are not yet published.)<br><br>Furthermore, 17 no-take marine reserves (protected) in the Visayas surveyed in 2001 through 2009 showed varying trends in biomass increase: a) one group increased from less than 5 to 150-200 tons/km<sup>2</sup> in five to seven years; and b) another group increased from less than 5 to 80-90 tons/km<sup>2</sup> in six to seven years.<br><br>We do not know yet whether these trends generally hold. But the chances are they would. Continuous monitoring of these reserves, however, is needed.<br><br>Summarizing, it appears that most unprotected and fished coral reef areas in the Visayas have lost about 90-95 percent of their fish biomass and only 5-10 percent remain, assuming 100 tons/km<sup>2</sup> is the average fish biomass for Philippine coral reefs.<br><br>The current baseline for fish biomass in the 2000s must therefore be 5-10 tons/km<sup>2</sup>. This is a cause for alarm by coastal residents and by the local government units.<br><br>In contrast, fully protected (from fishing) coral reefs have always increased their biomass in the course of time during our study.<br><br>We must, therefore, counter the finding of low fish biomass in coastal areas by establishing more no-take marine reserves, if we have to sustain the increasing human populations in coastal areas.<br><br>As it has been shown that net spillover of adult fish to fished areas occurs when biomasses of reserves are large, it becomes obvious that fishers stand to benefit in terms of increased fish catches from spillover from no-take reserves. There are, therefore, enough good reasons for establishing more no-take marine reserves to be fully protected in order to increase fish catches.<br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

No. 9165 based on reasonable doubt.<BR><BR>The Court has scrutinized the evidence on record but has found it wanting with respect to the identification of the seized drugs. To erase all doubts as to the identity of the seized drugs, the prosecution should have established the movement of the drugs from the accused, to the police, to the forensic chemist, and finally to the court.<BR><BR>The linkages in the chain of custody of the subject items were not clearly established. There was no explanation as to why it took almost 12 hours for the seized items to be brought to the PNP Crime Laboratory.<BR><BR>Most importantly, the Court could not find any evidence on how the seized items were stored, preserved, labeled and recorded within this 12 hour period.<BR><BR>One of those in the chain also failed to testify. The forensic chemist also had no testimony from whom she received the specimens from. The Court ruled that the chain of custody of the seized items was compromised and therefore the integrity of these items is questionable.<BR><BR>This serious flaw in the conduct of post-seizure custody of the dangerous drugs allegedly sold and possessed by the accused militates against the prosecution’s cause because it not only casts doubts on the identity of the corpus delicti, but also tends to discredit, if not totally negate the claim of regularity in the conduct of official police operations.<BR><BR>The woman here was arrested in the evening of Aug.13, 2007 after a buy bust operation at Zone 4, Barangay Looc. When searched after being arrested, the woman also was found in possession of another sachet which contained dangerous drugs.

When approached by the police operatives, he immediately threw the sachet on the ground. Vergara was arrested two days later on June 28, 2007 also at Zone 4, Barangay Looc behind the PPA compound. He was seen showing a sachet containing shabu to two persons when spotted by the police operatives. He immediately hid the sachet at the back pocket of his pants, while the two other persons ran away.<BR><BR>In both cases, the prosecution was able to adduce proof beyond reasonable doubt that Brillantes and Vergara were found in possession of the shabu as charged. In both cases also, the defense of Brillantes and Vergara, were both bare denial and nothing more. Denial is considered an inherently weak defense, for it can easily be concocted and is a common standard line of defense in drug cases. It is even weaker in the face of positive identification of the two by the prosecution witnesses.<BR><BR>",

(When I lived in Tokyo, for example, I would regularly race to this secluded teahouse adjacent a magnificent woods, and there, on a rock in the middle of a garden, I cry for home. Also, on Saturday midnights, I would bring to my bed a portable radio, where I snuggled away the wintry nights and tune in to the only show in Tagalog in a Tokyo FM station, listening to songs by Sharon Cuneta and Imelda Papin. Then I'd cry myself to sleep. Thinking back now, I laugh at the entire drama. But homesickness was no laughing matter then. It was a disease that kept me from enjoying, wholeheartedly, the strange and unfamiliar culture I found myself surrounded then.)'<br><br>I thought that I could just close my eyes, and conjure from the figments of thought that create our sense of place the details of what I knew as home and be transported back, so easily, to the old smells, the old textures of familiar things, the old sights that constituted a cartography of where I come from.<br><br>When I was ruminating on this, I was riding a tricycle from Robinson's Place on a late Sunday afternoon. I just had coffee at Bo's where I had tried to get some reading done -- but succeeded only by one chapter, haphazardly processed, interrupted by a constant flow of friends and familiar faces all saying hello.<br><br>When the tricycle made the right turn where the mall jutted at a much-trafficked intersection towards downtown, I could already hear, because of the intimate proximity of the City's game cockpit, the cacophony of voices placing bets on various colored fighting cocks.<br><br>It struck me that this intersection painted the perfect face for Dumaguete -- a place slowly crawling into cosmopolitan modernity, yet stuck for the most part in barriotic old-fashionedness. Some people call this charming.<br><br>It's not hard to set a place to memory, like etches on a stone tablet, although it may take some form of practice. The trick is to look at the familiar with the full weight of curiosity. Only then does it come across to you in a new way, since blindness is the usual side-effect of familiarity.<br><br>For example, passing by Hibbard Ave., I looked at the laundromat beside the fairy tale kitsch of architecture that is known around town as the Christmas House, and nitpicked at the name. Wishy Washy it's called. How witty. How cute and seemingly apt. But does the owner know \"wishy washy\" also means \"indecisive\"? Perhaps not. (In San Francisco, I stumbled upon a similarly named laundromat along Powell Street, and smiled.)<br><br>Then I considered that bricked corner that has Silliman Ave. bending over to Hibbard Avenue, and asked myself, how does one make that one last lingering look at a beloved? By taking in the strangeness of that corner's traffic of vehicles, and how the chaotic seems to be the sense of order that makes things flow.<br><br>By taking in the new intrusion of a pharmacy where once we played \"observing sidewalk life in an aquarium\" known as Scooby's. By taking in the ancient presence of the acacia trees; how they tower above us, and yet how we completely ignore them, we don't even see anymore the glaring wounds they suffer as puny city officials have allowed the cutting of their limbs in the name of infrastructure maintenance.<br><br>What else? There are other corners of the City I went to and committed to memory.<br><br>And then I leave the place. \"Why do you have to leave?\" somebody close to me asked me. \"It's just for a while,\" I told her. \"I need the break. I need to leave all this familiarity behind.\"<br><br>What I didn't tell her was that it was suffocating me, it was making me less human, less productive. What I didn't tell her was that I was trying to escape old ghosts and miserable people who can't be too happy unless they make everyone else around them as miserable as they are. What I didn't tell her was that to learn to love the place we have grown in, it is sometimes necessary to leave it for some span of time. Distance makes you more objective, makes you forget old hurts, makes you more philosophical (and accepting) of the place that holds the key to so much of who we are.<br><br>Days later, I also realized that so many of my friends were leaving it, we were like an exodus -- Karl Villarmea to Chicago, Bing Valbuena to Sydney, Likko Tiongson to Tokyo, Hope Tinambacan to Germany, and many others -- and we seemed to echo the same sentiment.<br><br>It is necessary to leave sometimes, even for a short while.<br><br>But I remember something Timothy Montes once wrote about Dumaguete, and our relationship with it. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"Nothing happens [here]. The [newspapers] can't find enough dogs bitten by men, everybody knows everybody, and one resorts to gossip in the face of the uneventfulness of leaves falling to the ground. Still, when one says goodbye, one never really leaves the place. The mild sadness grows within you and when you ask yourself what makes you hang around this place transfixed in time, you realize the irony of leaves falling to the ground. I love [Dumaguete]; that's why I hate it. Like leaves falling to the ground, we are suspended in mid-air and never quite reach the ground until we learn to despise it.\"</span><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "url": "knowing-the-age-of-fishes-p609-98.htm",
   "body": "<BR><BR>suakcrem@yahoo.com <BR><BR> <BR>We often ask questions about the age of things, plants, animals or people just as a matter of curiosity. But such questions have deep implications, and are legitimate questions to ask. Scientists especially make it a point to know ages of things. Thus, so much research has been done on questions of age in relation to many variables in nature. <BR><BR>Recently, a graduate student at Silliman University presented a masters’ thesis dealing partly on the age of a fusilier species (Pterocaesio pisang), a species of fish widely used as food in the Philippines. His findings throw much light into questions such as why this species appears to be resilient to intense fishing, that is, why it is able to resist local extinction under high rates of exploitation in the southeastern Negros Island and elsewhere. He found that the reason lies in the rapid growth to sexual maturity within less than a year. The species population has a fast turnover cycle of three to four years. Its life span is generally just three years and rarely four years, growing most rapidly during the first year. <BR><BR>This is in contrast to other fish species found on coral reefs, namely, groupers, snappers, parrotfishes and surgeonfishes. Surgeonfishes are especially long-lived, 30 to 40 years. These fishes are likely to become locally extinct under high rates of exploitation in contrast to the fusilier discussed above. These facts should serve as guide for the managers of fishery resources. <BR><BR>However, our research finding at Sumilon Island indicates that under extremely high rates of fishing mortality, the fusilier can also suffer depletion that could lead to eventual local extinction. But why it persisted in the Sumilon area, being the most abundant species caught by fishers, was most probably because there was a place where it could seek refuge from fishing on the island. The place was the Sumilon no-take reserve, which was fully protected for 10 years, 1974 to 1984. <BR><BR>The student’s study sites by coincidence were also in the areas with no-take marine reserves. The existence of no-take marine reserves seems to be a favorable factor for the maintenance of the populations of the fusilier. They (marine reserves) provided the refuge from fishing, where they (the fusiliers) can grow to larger sizes. Large-sized fish produce more eggs than small-sized fish, increasing the fecundity or reproductive potential of females. One can infer the importance of fully protected marine reserves as a fishery management tool. <BR><BR>The other notable aspect of the above study is the use of otoliths, the calcium carbonate structures found in the semicircular canals, which are responsible for the stability and balance of the fish. The canals are located near the brain. The layers of the otoliths are laid down at specific time intervals during the lifetime of the fish. In this fusilier species, a layer is laid down each day, as determined empirically by raising the fish in the laboratory. An otolith is sectioned, stained and examined under a microcope, and the number of layers counted as the basis for determining the age of a fish. The otolith layers are analogous to the tree rings also used for determining the ages of trees. <BR><BR>The use of otoliths is recommended for studies on other species of fish as guide to fishery management.<BR><BR><BR>",

(In my own experience, garden trees planted 10 years ago in what had been a one-tree cornfield in Valencia now need yearly pruning or they’d get much too tall.)   <BR><BR>Liptong Woodlands aims to become a repository of endemic plants.  The farmer organizations that with work with Rene and Pol are replicating the concept and expanding to other areas such as Lawigan in Bacong, Baslay in Dauin and Mantikil, Siaton.  <BR><BR>And to provide farmers with additional livelihood, agroforestry species, fruit trees and ornamentals are integrated into the creation of new forested areas. <BR><BR>There’s a sense of healing the earth in this work, restoring some of the richness,  natural beauty, and ecological health that has been lost through the carelessness, ignorance, and greed of our past dealings with the natural environment.  <BR><BR>But the great insight of the day in Liptong Woodlands is that it can be done, and that nature repays such efforts by bringing forth abundant green life.  <BR><BR>What will it take, I wonder, for local governments to catch on that this is the call of the day,  serious “rainforesting” in public lands,  encouraging and promoting the same through incentives,  in private land.  <BR><BR>Perhaps the time may yet come when those green dots in the DENR maps will multiply -  think how much greener Negros can be when we can connect those dots. <BR><BR><BR>",

It isn’t just a verb nor a Science concept wherein a substance transforms from one phase to another. In the teaching profession, there’s more to it as “change” signifies a remarkable, heart-warming voyage. Along with change are worthwhile experiences, and each experience connotes a mileage of overwhelming achievement. <br><br>I change. I grow one second older as the clock ticks, a day wiser as the morning sun stretches out of the horizon. In the profession I am passionately engrossed with, each passing day is a golden avenue of learning, sharing and growing. I had been a classroom teacher for quite a number of fruitful years. Since then, I have always felt my transformation - my “metamorphosis” as I call it. I likened myself as a then developing caterpillar that gradually morphed into “butterflydom” – bold, unafraid to soar into greater heights of unfamiliar challenges. <br><br>You change. Just like little buds of red, nourished by time and nature yet to scintillate as bunch of lovely roses, you too, have your fair share of holistic transformation. I am referring in particular about those whose hearts and minds have been genuinely touched by the joys of the teaching-learning process. You are a product of change. For so long as education remains the building block of peace and progress, you will always be the concrete reflection of what noteworthy changes have taken shape in your society – the kind of society characterized by your growing desire for a humane co- existence with other individuals. <br><br>Everyone changes. How education brings about significant growth for each breathing organism is best compared to how the sunlight reaches the seabed to proliferate marine life deep down below. Despite the growing concern for algal bloom on the surface the sun’s rays make its way and penetrate through to keep the equilibrium of nature. Education is like a big ball of fire. It is the guiding light as everyone, regardless of age, gender, and culture, sojourns through the trail called life. It is the source of heat we need as the winds of social upheavals strike. Education makes every individual an advocate of change. And everyone is the “change” that the world longs for. <br><br>Everything changes. Our existence remains a field of wonder. That’s almost always constant. Other than that, everything is changing. Some changes could be hardly felt, others could be too pressing to forget. This is when the value of education sets in. We cannot really direct the wind if it blows remorseless, but we certainly can adjust our sails for a safer cruise. One word: change. It’s a matter of a change in perspective. It makes us discern and dwell on a more positive outlook. <br><br>I teach. I coach. I grow. I inspire. I advocate worthwhile changes. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Dwight Esenio F.

Another post in Net dubbed it as the “skyscraper city,” creating visions of tall concrete buildings shooting for the sky like dozens of spaceships ready to blast off, something akin to Makati City in Metro Manila. <br><br>According to the architectural and planning firm, reputedly ranked 96 among the top 200 companies worldwide in the field of architecture commissioned to develop the prime property, the amenities of the business park will include a 4-star hotel, retirement homes (makes me wonder if I could afford to acquire one), 3-star movie houses (I thought movie houses are on the way out because of cable TV and online movies), and a display center for export products. <br><br>Another post says that “there will be at least three medium rise buildings…which will a least be 10 stories high… plenty of BPO companies and hotels will be locating in this area, plus corporate or regional headquarters of multinational or large local corporations.” <br><br>What caught my attention and made me conjure what the facility could become in the future is the inclusion of a Business Park Bay Walk in the overall development plan. “The developers promised that the Business Park’s Baywalk, once done, will be always ready for expansion especially connecting it to the present Rizal Boulevard in downtown Dumaguete making the whole Dumaguete baywalk very long stretching from the Rizal Boulevard towards the Business Park.” <br><br>This is good news and here’s the reason why. Last Sunday, 10.10.10, the owners temporarily lifted the restriction to enter the facility and some 800 participants in the Robinsons Buglasan Wellness Walk Challenge, for the first time, got inside and had a glimpse of what could one day be, not only a business park, but a real park, with green verdant trees where one could enjoy a good walk—all the way to the  Rizal Boulevard Baywalk—if the planners will consider planting trees in that area that they indicated as Business Park Bay Walk. <br><br>The Quarter Marathon Wellness Walk Challenge, a corporate social responsibility of Foundation University and Robinsons Dumaguete, aims to create a culture of walking to counteract what research says are potential health risks that people who live in a community that prides itself as the “motor cycle capital” of the Philippines could be prone to. Minimal use of the legs could result in people afflicted with the maladies of a sedentary lifestyle—obesity, cancer, hypertension, heart diseases and osteoporosis. The QMWW Challenge encourages people to walk a distance of 10.5 kilometers, which is equivalent to walking all the way from the Provincial Capitol to the Church in Sibulan and back. In last Sunday’s walk, some 800 walkers achieved this feat, among them, Alex and Irma Pal. <br><br>Conjure in your mind a stretch of some 2-3 kilometers of a walking route, with shady trees along the way from the Rizal Baywalk to the Business Park. The Baywalk will be a walkers’ and runners’ paradise. That is if the planners of the Business Park will  consider planting trees along the proposed Baywalk. And, there’s a doable way to do this. <br><br>Foundation University and the other academic institutions, could “adopt” the Business Park as what FU had done with the Banica River. Dean Sinco once remarked that the biggest ‘free labor” in the Philippines is the volunteer students fulfilling the requirements of the Civic Welfare Training Service Law. Under this law, college students are required to render one year of volunteer service for the benefit of their community. With some 10,000 students in University Town planting trees along the Baywalk, the future Business Park will not only be a city of skyscrapers, but will be an environmental paradise with trees serving as the “lungs” of Dumaguete City. <br><br>Will the Sy scions consider this proposal? <br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR> <BR>dominique.cimafranca@gmail.com <BR> <BR><BR>DAVAO CITY --Two weeks ago, I severed my link to my last online social network. Plurk had been a source of amusement for more than two years, and I met some kindred spirits there that I wouldn’t have found elsewhere. But when you gotta go, you gotta go, you know. <BR><BR>I’ll admit, it was a painful decision, and one I did not easily arrive at. Unlike Facebook, my Plurk had a much smaller community, and I had greater control over who I wanted to interact with. <BR><BR>Unlike Twitter, I could follow discussions easily. And one other hook: it used a system of karma points, which went up with every action and went down with inaction. <BR><BR>So why did I quit? In the main, I finally got bored. At the same time, I felt that it was sapping my creative energies and that, small community notwithstanding, I was starting to get annoyed with the herd mentality of social networks. <BR><BR>Boredom: I had to step back and examine the value that I was getting from social networks in general, and I found out that, entertainment aside, I really wasn’t getting anything much. <BR><BR>Oh, from time to time, I would get a link to a read-worthy article, but it comprised only a small fraction of the messages I had to process. <BR><BR>Yes, I know, brevity is the soul of wit and all that, but really, how much value can you get from 140 characters? It’s fine for small snippets, but many times, you need more than just the headline. You want the meat underneath. <BR><BR>Creativity: ever since I got into online social networks, I found that I was writing less and less. You only have to look at the entries on my blog, or lack thereof, in recent months. The act of writing is a psychological release, and by posting my thoughts to social networks, I was leaking out all these energies. I had lost the will to write. <BR><BR>It’s not just me. I’ve seen a general decrease in writing activity. Blogs of friends I used to follow have been abandoned. I no longer see the volume of submissions to the literary folio that I edit. Even entries to contests and applications to workshops that we’re running have gone down over the past year. <BR><BR>And finally, the herd mentality: perhaps the most insidious innovation of social networks is the “Like” button. With social networks, you no longer really have to work anything out on your own. All you have to do is find a post that you agree with and click “Like”. Then you rest easy in the thought that 16,487 people such as yourself agree with you. <BR><BR>And on the off-chance that you came up with something wholly original, you won’t feel the affirmation of your thoughts until some other friends “Like” what you posted. <BR><BR>Online social networks will herald the death of free, independent, and original thought. <BR><BR>So that’s why I decided to get off the online social network train. I wanted to save myself before it plunged down the precipice I see the tracks are leading to. And if by some chance it doesn’t, if by some chance I get left behind in that journey to the golden utopia of whatever-that-is, I don’t very much mind. I don’t want to live there. <BR><BR>                 * * * <BR><BR>I’ll be honest, I haven’t deleted my Plurk completely, nor my Twitter either. There’s still some value in staking presences there, if only to head off identity squatters. (For Plurk, I wrote a small script to update it with a daily greeting, just to keep my karma up.) <BR><BR>But for all intents and purposes, I am off the train. I don’t check those sites for updates anymore, and though there were the expected withdrawal symptoms, the experience has not been as bad as I feared it would be. <BR><BR>Facebook, which I deactivated in March and deleted in June this year, I don’t miss at all: good riddance, I say. <BR><BR>Disconnecting from online social networks, though a little painful at first, is easy, so remarkably easy. Here’s my two-step method. <BR><BR>Step one: you unfollow all your friends. <BR><BR>Step two: you get a real life. <BR><BR>Try it. <BR><BR>",

Just when you think that it’s only hot and empty, that nothing interesting will ever happen, you come across inexplicable scenes like this.  Or other scenes  equally strange:<br><br>It’s late, you’re walking down a dark street, sure that no one else is around. Then, out of the darkness comes a man. He approaches you, staggering under strange items for sale: large model sailboats, guitars, electric drills --nothing that anyone would buy on a dark street at night. When you don’t respond, he walks away with a resigned smile. <br><br>Two teenage boys walking along, laughing.  Maybe drunk. One of  them whispers something in the others’ ear and then hits him, hard. They are instantly surrounded by onlookers out of nowhere. They dance around each other for a minute with awkward martial arts gestures; finally one of them falls down, everybody leaves.  Quiet again.<br><br>A parade suddenly appears: drummers  and bells,  street dancers and slow cars. But there are no signs, no banners, no way to know who or what this is all about. And then it’s gone, and the street is empty again.<br><br>In European cities, everything follows a tight schedule. Even revolutions are announced two months in advance. Here, you never know what will happen at any time. Everything is a last minute operation. Events are so revised and postponed that even when they actually happen, it’s always a surprise. This prevents boredom. <br><br>It’s October now, the start of the “Silly Season” of  fiestas, fashion shows, founder’s days, street parades, beauty pageants -- that lasts until New Year’s.  The uncertainty that pervades daily life will double and triple now. The result is a kind of mild anarchy; but anarchy with a smile.<br><br>In the picture, these girls, these happy spirits in white who appeared suddenly on the midnight street – they were probably dressed for some event that started three or four hours late, and finally finished long after most of the city was asleep.

But  then he never met Imelda Marcos. Nor did  this Greek thinker  read  the  farce that is Imelda Marcos’ “Millennium  Development Goals” proposal. <br><br>House Bill 3252  would tap Overseas Filipino Workers -- plus   sweepstakes and other usual vaca lecheras -- to chip in  $10  billion (P437 billion) for an MDG  Fund.  <br><br>But  wish is not cash.  The glint in  Mrs Marcos’ eyes  won’t close the P85 billion  MDG  funding  gap, estimated by Philippine Institute of Development Studies. <br><br>MDGs are eight pledges to free people from hunger, disease and enlarge freedoms. Those  goals  were spelt out  into  measurable indicators. Meeting these  minimum targets would do away only  with extreme forms of deprivation. <br><br>In 2000, the Philippines and  190 countries signed on. People Power II  that year, by happenstance,  shoved Gloria Macapagal Arroyo into Malacanang.<br> <br>“We should have achieved MDGs  under the (Arroyo) regime”, says the study <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Winning the Numbers, Losing the War. </span><br><br>There were  plus factors. Remittances topped  $16 to $18 billion yearly. And skills abounded. Despite reckless  drawdowns, ecosystems held, albeit tenuously. We  flunked.  Today, “the  Philippines is in a worse poverty situation in 2010 than when it started on the MDGs.” <br><br>Prevalence of underweight children under five “is comparable to sub-Sharan Africa,” the last nutrition survey reports. Only three out of 10 drink potable water in the Autonomous Regions of Muslim Mindanao. <br><br>Like the  grandiose plans  that  the Ilocos Norte Congresswoman lofted  earlier, her  bill will fall by the wayside. One reason is that corruption cases bug the lady. <br><br>The Anti-Graft Court, this September, ordered her to return P10 million to the National Food Authority. The dictator had ordered NFA to unload the cash into  a Marcos personal account in Security Bank (Makati). <br><br>“Imelda  should  bankroll the MDG  Fund from  her shell foundations, not us,” OFW  Rodolfo  Lugay in Qatar  suggests.  “Among those listed by the Supreme Court were Vibur, Xandy-Wintrop, Palmy and Maler Foundations.” <br><br>The new   administration has only a “small window of opportunity” to make up for the previous regime’s  flagging performance. <br><br>In 2015 -- the fifth year of PNoy’s administration -- the UN will receive MDG reports  from member states. Can  PNoy stitch close tears in  MDGs 1, 2, and 5 goals. <br><br>Goal 1 would halve poverty. The penury threshold is an unrealistic P41 per person per day.  The pace of  poverty reduction did not decelerate. It actually increased. The next official reports will reveal  more indigents  and underweight children. Number of families, whose intake of  food  slipped below  adequate dietary needs, will bolt. <br><br>Goal 2  pledged   “universal primary education.” But 17 out of every 100 kids are not enrolled. Dropouts persist. “Government  spends less on education than Asian neighbors do. Such failure means another generation of poorly-educated Filipinos…” <br><br>Goal 5 would tamp down deaths of  women at childbirth to 52,  from today’s 162  (compare that  to Malaysia’ mortality rate of  17). Proportion of  births,  attended by health personnel,  should have increased from 63 to 80 percent. That didn’t happen. <br><br>“We know who and where they are,” the report says. Medical technology is available....“So why is there no dramatic decline in mortality rates? Why don’t we hear women’s outrage?... Children have the right to live beyond age five… but large numbers in  (poor homes) start dying after they are born….” <br><br>“Can the Philippines keep its MDG promises?” asks the study. “We have a new regime whose legitimacy  is beyond question and enjoys a high level of trust… Its predecessor was born in turbulence, governed in turbulence (and ) left  many issues demanding urgent closure.” <br><br>The causes interlock. Rapid  population growth  strained  “carrying capacity” of land and fishing groups. “Wealth and power (are) skewed in favor of Manila”. Half of the 20 poorest provinces cluster in Mindanao . Total allocation for indigenous people “equals the pork barrel of only three senators.” <br><br>Foreign debt repayments sap  social services. Crooks pocket 25 centavos out of every tax peso, some guesstimates claim.  Over P66 million in Tesda funds, for example, were spent for Macapagal-Arroyo T-shirts. <br><br>Fund transfers  reached “grotesque  proportions”, former National Treasurer Leonor Magtolis  Briones  writes. In  2004, President Arroyo juggled  P140 billion  from various agencies to other offices. Malacanang last  year spent quadruple the P224.6 million authorized for travel. “Nothing came of Commission on Audit  complaints.” <br><br>President  Aquino  should be ‘given full marks’ for having focused, in his  first budget, on “education, health and poverty reduction,” notes  the no-nonsense Solita Monsod in Reality Check.  “(He used) the funds saved through more efficient use.... The proposed “budget does reflect base priorities…” <br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ang simula ay siyang unang hati ng katapusan.</span> That’s  the Tagalog version of the English axiom: “Well begun is half done.”  Now for the other half. <br><br>By granting tax breaks to cronies, Congress cut income by P90 billion—far more than the P75 billion earned through VAT taxes. “What is taken by the left hand by increased VAT  rates is given away by  the right though incentives.” <br><br>“Quit  making highways that lead to nowhere, basketball courts or building  waiting sheds that wait for no one,” Social Watch convenor Magtolis Briones nudged legislators. “Align instead  your  pork barrel slabs to achieve  MDG goals in your districts.” <br><br>The  budget  debates  will see if  PNoy is able to maintain the needed  reversal of course he ordered. <br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><script type=\"text/javascript\"><br><br><br><br>  var _gaq = _gaq || [];<br><br>  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-19225625-1']);<br><br>  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);<br><br><br><br>  (function() {<br><br>    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;<br><br>    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Two others, Eulalio Bragazo and Rene “Toto” Quirante, were shot dead earlier also in Guihulngan. <BR><BR>A press statement from the 11th Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army based in Guihulnga said that his death added to the alarming rise in the number of civilians killed by the NPA. <BR><BR>Jackusalem was believed targeted by the NPA for his perceived association with soldiers and policemen in Guihulngan. He was an NPA rebel before he availed of government amnesty, and has returned to mainstream society. <BR><BR>Meanwhile, Lt. Col. Ramil Bitong, 11th IB commander, said in the press statement that it is now apparent that the NPA is again implementing a purging of its own ranks. “I just hope that the NPAs would spare helpless civilians from their brutality”, Bitong said. <BR><BR>He reiterated his call to the self- proclaimed human rights advocates to look into the recent spate of killings in Guihulngan perpetrated by the NPA. <BR><BR><BR>",

From there the LORD scattered them over the face of the whole earth. </span><br><br>After surviving the first catastrophic global natural disaster that was recorded in Scripture known as the Great Flood which lasted for 40 days and 40 nights, Noah and his entire family, the only human survivors,  received a very specific instruction from God, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth.</span>” In Genesis 10, otherwise known as the Table of Nations, we find that the three sons of Noah, Japeth, Shem and Ham indeed followed God’s command.  In the said chapter, we find 70 names of Noah’s descendants who eventually re-populated the earth. In Genesis 11, we learn that these new citizens of the earth enjoyed the grace and favor of the Lord.  They eventually became very productive, efficient and united as a people enjoying a common speech and language.  Such blessedness ushered a very strong and confident posture in their hearts that they believed they could do anything their hearts ever desired.  <br><br>First, they said to each other <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Come, let’s make bricks and bake them thoroughly.”</span>  Although the Scripture is silent as to the details of this production endeavor, what we can say is that the people had reached a distinct level of confidence about their skills and capabilities as a nation.   <br> <br>And rightly so, the moment they successfully mass-produced these bricks, they immediately leveled up their goal.  They said, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.”</span> It became quite obvious at this time that the spirit of arrogance had made its way into their consciousness.  They were aware of the favor of God, they were conscious of their powerful unity as a people and they were very mindful of their capabilities, strengths and achievements.  The must have told one another, “Given who we are and what we have done, what can we possibly not do?”  <br><br>Commenting on what the descendants of Noah had committed, noted theologian Matthew Henry said, “How soon men forget the most tremendous judgments, and go back to their former crimes! But, what really was their crime?  In the context of Greek literature, their “crime’ was “hubris.”  Hubris, the common downfall of the Greek gods and goddesses of old,  is a word that means “extreme haughtiness or arrogance because of one’s failure to be in touch with reality causing an overestimation of one’s own competence or capabilities.” <br><br>And so we read that in answer to humanity’s pride and defiance of God, the Lord visited the city they were building and unleashed a powerful spirit of confusion that destroyed their unity as a people and caused them to separate from each other because of that confusion. Thus the tower they built--- the tower that was suppose to make them famous ended up having an infamous name.  It was eventually named was called “Babel” which means “confusion.”  The city and the tower were never completed.  The big time project was eventually abandoned by the people because of their confusion. Certainly there are many complex and scholarly commentaries available on what this spirit of confusion is really all about, but one thing we can establish for now is that hubris is and forever will be sure recipe for destruction.  <br><br>After the great flood, the Lord gave a sacred covenant to Noah and his children that God’s presence will be with them and that the Lord had given them the blessing to reign over his creation according to his righteous intentions.  But instead of taking the promises of God to heart and taking responsibility over creation, the people slid back to their old ways.  They had again become self-preserving, cunning, and  had developed an obsession to make a name for themselves. <br> <br>According to some commentaries, the builders of the tower actually engraved their names on the bricks to immortalize themselves and secure their participation in this colossal undertaking.   But you see friends, just before their hubris completely destroyed them, God—in his awesome goodness--- intervened.  In a very a creative and wise manner, the Lord established his sovereignty one more time and reminded humanity who was really in control.   <br><br>Today, thousands of years after that tower was built, the whole world finds itself in the same dilemma.  As the entire global community continues to enjoy unprecedented advancement in almost every sphere of human existence, we are also facing the risks and the dangers of our own achievements. Day after day and generation after generation, defiance against God continues to emerge  in many shapes and forms--- from the very subtle to the very explicit.  This reality has not even spared us, the church of Jesus scattered all over the world today trying our very best to salt of the earth and light of the world. Karl Barth one of the most influential theologians in the 20th century wrote, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Whenever people claim to be able to see the Kingdom of God… what they actually see is not the Kingdom of God, but the Tower of Babel.” </span><br><br>And so today, we pause and humbly come before the Lord with repentance --- for our self-serving ways, our presumptuousness, our lack of fear and reverence of God; our delusions of grandeur; and for many other desires of our hearts that have made us think so highly of ourselves. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gracious God, many of us today are in the crossroads of our lives.  We are trying to find our own little place in this world --- and to live out our purpose, our significance and our glorious destiny.  Take a tight hold of our hearts, O God, so that we may never end us building lofty towers for ourselves or taking credit for works that you alone have done by your mercy and grace. Bring our hearts back to the Covenant you have offered to humanity from the beginning of time through Jesus Christ ---- that if we will be your people, you will surely be our God.   Have mercy upon us O God, and save us from our foolishness before it’s too late!  </span><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

But the fact that a practice is traditional is not in itself a sufficient reason to continue it. Rather, the pros and cons of continuing vs. abandoning the practice must be weighed, and if change is deemed necessary, we must have the courage to undertake it. <br><br>In the “pros” column, there appear to be several reasons for the practice of<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> da-ub.</span>  The smoke repels mosquitoes, if  only temporarily. It also helps to control the bugs which attack fruit trees. Further, it is said to encourage trees to bear fruit.  Finally, it is an easy and convenient way to get rid of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> sagbot</span> (leaves, twigs and grass).  <br><br>But there are alternative, greener ways of controlling mosquitoes and tree-pests; there are other ways to induce fruit trees to bear; organic materials can and should be composted; and if garbage collection is not efficient, that issue can and should be addressed. <br><br>There are many costs, many “cons.”  Firstly, your right to extend your fist ends where my nose begins: the smoke from these fires can permeate entire neighborhoods for hours, and the constant presence of such smoke can aggravate, and even cause respiratory conditions such as asthma, emphysema, and allergies. <br><br>Smoke is also known to be carcinogenic (cancer- causing). These effects are multiplied when household trash is burned in combination with <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sagbot</span>, which adds foul odor and extreme toxicity into the mix.  Children and the elderly are particularly susceptible to the ill effects of such pollutants. <br><br>I understand that this is an age-old tradition, but many things used to be traditional: slavery and human sacrifice come to mind. Furthermore, we did not always live in such close quarters here in the Philippines, and our ancestors were not exposed to as many toxins as we are, from our food, auto emissions and household products. <br><br>Changing conditions call for a re-evaluation of traditional practices, especially this one. This is a very serious quality of life issue, which is why laws have been passed to prohibit the practice.  <br><br>Unfortunately, these laws do not appear to be enforced here in Dumaguete.  As a public health advocate (and who among us is against public health?), I’m appalled by the lack of enforcement of this law.  The Department of Health should get involved in campaign to discourage <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">da-ub</span>.  <br><br>The City Fire Department should be involved as well, since it poses a fire hazard, especially when the fire is not attended and has combustible materials in it. The deleterious impact on peoples’ health presumably results in increased costs to the government for medical care, money that is all too scarce, and could be put to far better use.  <br><br>To any of  our dedicated public servants reading this article who agree and understand the seriousness of this issue, I will be very happy to assist them in developing an effective campaign to eradicate this practice. After all, “a healthy Filipino, is a wealthy one.” Don’t we all want a healthy and a happy community? <br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(Virginia Maja-Stack joins the MetroPost as a regular columnist.

I thought of this while spending a week in Metro Manila, something I rarely do anymore as the traffic, structural, and human congestion, and the sheer visual chaos, get me down.  <BR><BR>It’s staggering for me to remember that Highway 54, today’s EDSA, in the early ‘60s still cut through open grassy areas and passed relatively few buildings as I went everyday from San Juan to UP in Diliman, Quezon City.   <BR><BR>EDSA today is a horror of cement MRT pylons plastered with posters, uninterrupted succession of buildings and structures shabby or new, smoke- belching buses crowding thousands of other vehicles,  people everywhere, and  the crowded competition of  towering billboards.  <BR><BR>I’m sure most of that happened in the name of commerce and economic activity, but why does “development” in this sense also produce such ugliness, pollution, and a compromised quality of life? <BR><BR>There is much to guard against as Dumaguete seeks to stimulate its economy. EDSA and other parts of Metro Manila provide many object-lessons in what not to do or to allow.  <BR><BR>Already, billboards are going up in this City, large and distracting to drivers. <BR> <BR>I would have thought the male population drinks quite enough, but no, a huge Gold Eagle beer billboard urges them: Araw-araw mag-relax. <BR><BR>The City Engineering office says they only regulate billboard size and structural stability, and that anyone with a roof or wall to rent out can do so --  the City could, therefore, sprout billboards galore on many rooftops.  They suggested that the City’s land use plan currently being revisited should address the matter of billboards. <BR><BR>I’ve been told that Hawaii made a policy of disallowing billboards altogether, now wouldn’t that be an option, too?  <BR><BR>Has anyone noticed an ugly tall building, (apparently 10 stories are allowed), going up across the City Health building?  Maybe that provision needs re-examining, too, to avoid the visual jumble of tall and low structures. <BR><BR>More and more buildings and structures are going up.  Is there also a plan for creating more green lungs or additional small parks,  which would mean acquiring land for this purpose?   <BR><BR>What about roadside trees to encourage people to walk in the shade in the inner city? What about some car-free streets? Will the Dumaguete of the future still be the preserve of noisy, ugly, inefficient tricycles or will some rational public transport system, at least for the business sections of the City, be put in place?  <BR><BR>A private/public partnership could conceivably set up and operate such a system.

Incidentally, a low-carbon mass public transport system is high up on the list of measures for a “green” city.   <BR><BR>But apart from firmly acting to avoid the worst aspects of unregulated urban growth, and becoming just like every other urban center in the country,  the question also is about how Dumaguete City can preserve its distinctiveness and enhance its natural and historical advantages.  <BR><BR>City Councilor Atty. Manuel Arbon recently mentioned his idea of working towards preserving a  “heritage city.”   <BR><BR>The city government would do well to think in this direction,   rather than only to pursue conventional paths of economic development that too often have demonstrated unintended negative impacts.   <BR><BR>Will the Dumaguete City of the future be just like any other run-of- the-mill small provincial town, or can the city government muster up a higher ambition for the City and its people? <BR><BR>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>docmequi@yahoo.com <br><br><br>My column last Oct 10 had a titillating title: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Unitown could pioneer in mixed-gender sports.”</span> I wrote about FU President Mira Sinco writing City Schools Supt. Dr. Profetiza Lim requesting her to allow our elementary pupil, Michaela G. Jumawan, to play in the boys football competition of the City Division Meet. <br><br>Mixed-gender sports among children is a desirable practice because there are no significant physical, mental, social or emotional differences among children that prevent them from playing together. <br><br>There are studies supporting mixed-gender sports and in the recently-concluded Youth Olympic Games held in Singapore, mixed-gender swimming was part of the calendar of events. In the Visayas, it is a common sight to see children of mixed-gender playing football together. <br><br>Another reason for our advocacy of mixed-gender sports is to correct the imbalance in the provision of opportunity for sports participation among girls in the Palarong Pambansa and in other sporting leagues. This advocacy is in consonance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child which guarantees the “right of the child to play and recreation.” <br><br>In my column, I wrote:  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“We hope that Dr. Lim will approve the request, and in doing so, she will go down in the history of the Palarong Pambansa as the first enlightened school official of the DepEd who supports mixed- gender sports in the annual school games.”</span> <br><br>The City Division Meet is over and Dr. Lim has not answered President Sinco’s letter. <br><br>I continued to pursue the campaign by getting in touch with Philippine Sports Commission Chair Richie Garcia and suggested to him that since the PSC is mandated by law to “provide the leadership, direction and guidelines” for sports to issue an Order urging all agencies involved in sports development to integrate mixed-gender sports in their programs. I volunteered to craft the draft Order. <br><br>Chairman Garcia on Oct. 13 texted back saying: “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">We are trying to talk to DepEd about what you said. I am with you that we should have mix gender in some sports. Please send me a copy (of the draft Order). We will see what we can do about this.”</span> <br><br>I worked furiously on the draft Order, writing up to 3 in the morning, hoping against hope that Chairman Garcia and the PSC Board, although in the midst of a budget hearing, could issue it prior to the start of the City division meet on Oct 14. However, Chairman Garcia texted me on Oct 15 saying: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Sorry that I have not really gone through the papers yet. Congress is giving us a hard time. Today is my 5th time to go there (Congress) in a week. I will go through it later and talk to the commissioners. I talked to Chito [Loyzaga, one of the Commissioners] and he is all for it. Thank you for the support.” </span><br><br>Akiko Thomson-Guevarra is the lone lady Commissioner in the PSC Board. She is also secretary-general of the Philippine Amateur Swimming Association. As a school girl, she competed in swimming in the Palarong Pambansa. She became an outstanding swimmer and she represented the Philippines in the Olympic Games. She is in-charge of women’s sports programs of the PSC. <br><br>I provided Commissioner Akiko a copy of the draft Order and asked her to support its issuance. The proposed Order is titled: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Inclusion of Mixed-Gender Sports in Government- Supported Sports Program.”</span>  It mandates that “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">All government funded and supported sports programs, projects and activities such as, but not limited to the conduct of the Palarong Pambansa, the games of a) the State Colleges and Universities Athletic Association, b) Commission on Higher Education, c) Government Corporations Athletic Association, as well as, those organized by the private sector but receiving funds and material support of any form from the government, shall include and integrate mixed-gender sports in their programs of training and competition in order to provide greater opportunity for sports participation among Filipino girls and women.” </span><br><br>I found out that Chairman Garcia was leaving for abroad on Oct 18, without any positive move towards the issuance of the Order. I was resigned and ready to give up the campaign for the rest of year when I realized that there’s one last  opportunity for mixed-gender sports to be included in this year’s sports calendar: the University Games to be held in Dumaguete City starting Sunday, Oct 24. <br><br>I sent Akiko the following text message: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“May you and the PASA be the first to stage mixed-gender swimming in the PSC-backed Unigames next week. Create media millage of the event. Ask the swimming tournament committee to stage a couple or more of mixed-gender swimming relays as demonstration sports. Chairman Garcia and you will donate the medals in this mixed-gender historic event in Phil swimming at the Unigames, ala Singapore Youth Olympic Games. Give statements to media favoring mixed-gender sports. ” </span><br><br>Being told that Unigames President Roger Banzuela was already in town, I texted him late at night of Oct 19: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Consider the Unigames as the first in RP to hold a mixed-gender sports event by having some mixed-gender relay in swimming as was done by FINA in the recent Singapore Olympic Games. It will be good publicity for the Unigames, a historic event. Kahit demo sport lang. Unahan mo na ibang sports leagues bago maging uso ang mixed-gender sports.” </span><br><br>And, early next morning, once again, I sent the following text message to Akiko: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Here’s Roger Banzuela’s cp number in case you want him to include a few mixed-gender swimming relay in the Unigames as demo event and an experiment. Roger is president of Unigames. He’s in Dumaguete now for opening on Sunday. A call from you as PASA Sec-Gen and as PSC commissioner could start the ball rolling in the mixed-gender sports campaign.” </span><br><br>I thought that was my last desperate effort to make our University Town the “pioneer” in mixed-gender sports.  But look at this. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Good proposal, I’ll inform the Tournament Managers and the Coaches in our Tech Meeting.”</span>  This was Unigames President Roger text message to me on Oct 19 at 09:02.32. <br><br>Will Dumaguete City, our University Town, be the setting of the first event in mixed-gender sports? <br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The Catholic Church bucks  provisions that’d   fracture conscience. But  scrapping the bill won’t dent high rates of infant mortality, maternal deaths, and abortions. <br><br>“Such dehumanizing conditions should not  continue,” write theologian  Eric O. Genilo, S.J, sociologist John J. Carroll, S.J., and constitutionalist  Joaquin Bernas, S.J.  Needed is a third option, namely: “critical and constructive engagement”. <br><br>Across the  road, businessmen urged  the debate on RH  step back from  sterile finger-wagging.  A   cascade of  wizened  babies, born of  mothers, trapped into  life-long poverty is a prescription for disaster, agreed  the Management Association of the Philippines, Makati Business Club, and  the Bishops-Businessmen’s Conference for Human Development. A  compromise solution is urgent. <br><br>Amend  HB96’s  objectionable provisions  but retain positive features, LST’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Option Three</span> suggests:  The  paper offers  “talking points” in  eight areas:  from  protection of life, contraceptives to  sex education, and services within  a multi-religious society.  Excerpts: <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The  Constitution directs the state to  protect the life of the unborn upon conception. When? Fertilization?  Or  implant of an embryo in the womb? The Constitution doesn’t say. “The Church insists on protection of human life upon fertilization.” </span><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">This is  not hair-splitting.  The definition has “a bearing whether contraceptives that prevent the implantation of embryos would be legally allowed.” Medical and legal experts must clarify the definition.  “Parameters of what reproductive services can be provided” could then be set. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Is  prevention of implantation of an embryo an abortion? If the state takes this position, then contraceptive medicines and devices, determined as abortifacient, must be banned, whether the RH bill is passed or not. Other religious  traditions allow  contraceptives without abortifacient effects. They’re a no-no for Catholics. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Catholic social  teaching  rejects imposition of norms , by a majority, that discriminates against rights of minorities: Various religions form consciences, in family planning,  according to  what their faith allows and prohibits. Government has the duty to provide information on all  non-abortifacient, (as defined by law),  family planning methods. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Can  government  set up parallel  information and training programs, one for natural family planning  and another for artificial methods? In both, the conscience of health workers and trainers should be respected. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The RH bill  mandates sexuality education curriculum. If parents find  the curriculum  unacceptable, can they insist  their children be  exempted?   The Constitution allows religious instruction in public schools, only if the parents consent in writing.  </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">HB96 must  respect conscientious objection of individual educators. Religious schools  should  write and implement their own sexuality education curriculum . Public schools and non-religious private schools can appoint panels to write their  curriculum. Education Department could monitor both. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Under the RH bill,  contraceptives  must  be stocked as “essential  and emergency medicines in government health centers and  hospitals”  Why?  Is pregnancy a disease?  </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Medical experts can define  where a contraceptive is a medically indicated treatment .If some contraceptives are ultimately decided as essential or emergency drugs,  no contraceptives with abortifacient effects should  be allowed. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The RH bill  compels employers  to bankroll, in their collective bargaining agreements, reproductive health services of their employees.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"> <br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">General  Philhealth medical coverage -- mandatory for all employees -- provides for reproductive health services, upon the employee’s request..  This process  allows employers, with religious objections to contraceptives or sterilizations, elbow room. They can  avoid direct formal cooperation in such methods. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The bill’s authors stitched in a  provision that penalizes “malicious disinformation against the intention and provisions of the bill.”  Just  what  constitutes “malicious disinformation”?  The authors don’t  say. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Haunted by the dictatorship’s gag on liberty of expression, people  insist on a precise definition. “Failing that, the provision should be scrapped.” </span><br><br>“A  man’s creed is as good as his deeds”. So, what about the  implementation, assuming  a compromise measure passes? <br><br>Representatives from major religious traditions should be represented in the  committee  tasked  to oversee “implementing norms”, the LST paper  suggests:  This would “ensure that the rights of people of various faiths would be protected.” <br><br>The “talking points”  seek “to generate constructive and respectful dialogue”, write the Loyola school  professors.  Finger-wagging  is  pointless.   Negotiations are  “a more positive step”  towards working for the good of all, especially  “the unborn, the youth, women, and families in difficult circumstances. <br><br>“We need to come to a consensus for the common good”. Some issues  can be left to individual decisions.   “We need to respect freedom of conscience of every Filipino.” <br><br>“We are members of the same human family and community.”  The rule should be: “In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; and in all things, charity.”<br> <br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>dominique.cimafranca@gmail.com <BR><BR><BR>DAVAO CITY --Two weeks ago, my co-teacher Ed asked me to sit in the panel of his technopreneurship class. I don’t know what made me particularly qualified to judge the students’ entrepreneurial ideas, excepting perhaps the string of failed businesses and half-started ventures that I have under my belt. Nevertheless, I accepted the invitation as I thought it was another chance to interact with the students. Perhaps I was also looking for inspiration to start anew. <BR><BR>It’s hard enough to come up with a good and original idea for a business -- and harder still to pull it off. I should know: failed businesses and half-started ventures, remember? <BR><BR>I thought of my stint as a sounding board for the students. With a pair of fresh eyes, not under pressure from deadlines of finishing the paperwork, I could point out where the business plans were weak, and where they could work. <BR><BR>Some plans were good, some plans so-so. I actually found one worth putting time and money into, if the students were willing to work on it over the next semester. We’ll see. <BR><BR>I did come out from the experience with more insight, and that made the time investment in sitting in the panel worthwhile. <BR><BR>Specifically, I found some fundamental pitfalls that students kept falling into. I’m sharing them here for my future reference and for your comments, if any. <BR><BR>Pitfall #1: Too broad a target market. Or to put it another way, not defining the target market specifically enough or well enough. Without this defining quality, the venture loses focus and therefore, feels half-baked. <BR><BR>Because there are far too many competing services out there now, it is essential for the beginning technopreneur to identify a niche service. Given the limited resources of startups, defining a niche one can excel at gives the best chances for success. <BR><BR>The one business idea I felt worth getting into did precisely this: they had a very specific group that they wanted to offer their service to. Granted, there were some problems with the approach, but because the target market was well-defined to begin with, they could just adapt the mechanics more quickly. They didn’t need to rip out the guts of their plan. <BR><BR>Pitfall #2: Not following the money. The students were coming out with ideas meant to cater to the “lowest common denominators”, groups that the students imagined were underserved because of their perceived lack of means. <BR><BR>Perhaps this approach might work for a social venture (even then, I don’t particularly think so, and I’ll explain at another time), but it’s a bad way to plan a business. Why? Partly because they don’t have the money to spend (or more specifically, the money to spend on the service that the students want to offer), but mainly because the students have not really thought this market through. More on that in Pitfall #3. <BR><BR>It seems to me, though, that this is a very Filipino way of thinking...a knee-jerk reaction to provide services to “the masses” but without understanding what “the masses” want. <BR><BR>Pitfall  #3: Underestimating the market. Ironically, this ties to the problem mentioned in Pitfall #2. The students start out with this misconception of what it it means to be poor and underprivileged, and design services accordingly. But this leads to outrageous assumptions, for example: a “poor” person would not have access to the Internet, and would rather only use services that make use of SMS. But think about it, four text messages already equals an hour in an Internet cafe. <BR><BR>And so we have this seeming paradox. Which one is it, really? Does the target market have the means, or doesn’t it? On deeper examination, the conflict can be resolved by an understanding of the market, which comes to greater focus when addressing Pitfall #1 properly. <BR><BR>Pitfall #4: Not having fun. This, quite possibly, is the biggest failing that threaded through many of the projects. I surmise that the students put forward proposals that they thought were “serious” or “adult”. Perhaps or perhaps not, but many just sounded quite dreary to me. Such a shame, because this is supposed to be a young crowd of aspiring technopreneurs, but they all took the fun and joy out of their projects. <BR><BR>Worse, I think the projects would fail the cooking test: would you yourself be willing to use this service that you are putting up? <BR><BR>So there you have it, four pitfalls I identified from my students’ project proposals. If the assessment sounds harsh, it’s not meant to be; and if I recognize these weaknesses, it’s only because I recognize those weaknesses in my own thinking. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "<BR>suakcrem@yahoo.com  <BR><BR>One of our difficulties in ascertaining the true state of our environment and natural resources is the  failure of assessment agencies to adopt appropriate, standard methodologies of gathering the data. For example, many organizations conducting assessments use rapid methods with inadequate samples. These assessments are good only for showing  a rough idea of the status of the resources. Reports on such assessments  contain data that cannot be compared with those obtained by generally acceptable, standard methods. This state of affairs makes it difficult to make definite conclusions as to the real status of the environment or natural resources. <BR><BR>We must insist on the use of standard methods in all assessments for inter- comparability of data. It is not difficult to access these methods. They are the ones used by authors of papers that are published in the best journals in the various fields of science, the refereed journals. These published papers have passed the scrutiny of experts in any one of the scientific fields. In addition, it is usually safe to avail of the advice of reputable and well known scientists before deciding to adopt methods to be used in surveys. <BR><BR>Accurate and reliable data are needed to build databases, which are now considered essential for long  term monitoring of the status of the environment for management purposes at various times in the future. The national government departments concerned with the environment as well as local government units should develop these databases that will serve as guides to making good decisions on the kinds of interventions required for good management.  <BR><BR>Members of  academic institutions are expected to know about methodology. Yet they commit gross mistakes in data gathering and data presentation. For example, I have just reviewed a report from a supposedly good university dealing with assessment of coastal resources. The data were presented in graphs without error bars and without mentioning the number of samples. What was unfortunate was the fact that the research activity was sponsored by a supposedly competent agency of government, indicating negligence in properly reviewing the report before publication. Such lapses give us a bad name in the community of  researchers. <BR><BR>One way to remedy the deficiencies of researchers is to set up a system of mentoring those involved in  conducting  surveys or assessments from the first stages of the process, such as proposal writing, to the last stages of report writing and publication. Academic institutions have to institute this remedial process in order to produce reliable and accurate data and information. <BR><BR>The long-term solution lies in the training and mentoring of our students in the graduate schools. I have mentioned this idea  a number of times in my advocacy for the reform of our graduate schools. Many, if not the majority, of our graduate students obtain their master’s and doctorate degrees without developing competence in writing research papers. What can be expected? They are taught by “professors” who do not practice research and writing. Philippine universities and colleges should insist that those who teach in the graduate schools are good examples for students to emulate. <BR><BR>In connection with foregoing comment, I think the Commission on Higher Education should take the lead in the reform of graduate schools. It should take a look at the status of graduate education in the country and institute changes in order to raise its standards, which, in my opinion, is not comparable to those of our neighboring countries like Singapore.<BR><BR>",

Buglasan’s nascence in 1981, under the auspices of Foundation University and the Negros Oriental <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Balikatan sa Kaunlaran</span>, was spearheaded by the late Bayanihan Dance Company founder-choreographer, National Artist for Dance Lucresia Reyes-Urtula, to organize and select the provincial performing delegation for the Annual Folk Arts Festival at the CCP. <br><br>The first Buglasan winners comprised Oriental Negros’ contingent to the first National Folk Arts Festival in Manila, and that of the following year in the Folk Arts Festival in Leyte; gaining accolades and awards for the province in both instances. In the mid ‘80s, the festival seemed to rest on its laurels. The lull could be attributed to the civil unrest in the hinterlands, particularly of the continuing clash between the military and the rebels. The festival was revived in 1990 as part of Oriental Negros’ celebration of its centennial as a province. A very apt move, as the the province’s name used to be Buglas, after the reed grasses that filled the land when the Spanish surveyors first visited Negros Island. Dubbed “Buglasan: Festival of Festivals,” the celebration will bring together a dozen of Oriental Negros’ distinctive festival traditions. <br><br>In a province with at least one fiesta each month, efforts have been widespread in promoting each town or city’s indigenous cultural traditions. The streetdancing presentations and other related activities will surely enhance the color and excitement of every local town fiesta. The Yagyag Festival of Sibulan town was the grand winner in the DoT’s national festivals showdown in 2000 at the Quirino Grandstand. Buglasan 2010 is greenlighted by the 2-day organic farm congress and the search for the Buglasan King & Queen. The rest of the festival will also see competitions in such cultural gems as balak, balitaw and harana as well as the rondalla and cumparsa. The MTV-generation won’t be disappointed with the singing and cheerdance competitions. The tail-end of the revelry will culminate in the grand showdown of the streetdancing delegations. Fireworks display will signal the culmination of the event. <br><br>“The event hopes to balance the private sector with government funding. There will be no lock-out of products although we will give priority to stakeholders who’ve been with us since the beginning. We wrote everybody to participate but in the end it boiled down to who has the most degree of support. The committee signed a memorandum of agreement with the Negros Oriental Business Development Foundation for government support of an allocated budget. The Department of Tourism likewise earmarked a fund for the event. There will be fifty events in close to two weeks of fun-filled activities,” revealed festival co-chair Glynda Descuatan during a media conference. <br><br>Visiting tourists could also use some of their free time exploring the province’s exciting destinations. Down south is the municipality of Dauin for those who want to commune with nature and explore the colors of the deep in Apo Island. As to modernity, the quiet and quaint town of Dauin has some of the best world-class resort hotels one can find in the entire archipelago. <br><br>A case in point is the Bahura Beach Resort with its sprawling verdant property offering breathtaking sceneries whether viewed from within or without. Located some 16 kilometers south of Dumaguete City is one hideaway not oft-seen. From the coast up to six kilometers inland, the land is smooth to relatively flat. From this point, the topography rises rather gently and then very abruptly after three kilometers and tapers off a little bit until it reaches the foothills of the majestic Cuernos de Negros mountain ranges. <br><br>Valencia town’s Forest Camp, the Province’s little Baguio, is one serene place; a treasure trove of endemic species that have piqued the interest of both scientist and tourist. Down southwards, midway to the ranges, is the pristine Balanan Lake in Siaton while further down northwards are the twin lakes of Danao and Balinsasayao in San Jose. After a scenic cruise in the latter, be sure to drop by the plush Azalea Restaurant for a meal or merienda before heading off to the city’s night lights. <br><br>For those who love the sea, hie off to Manjuyod’s White sand bar, an atoll that rises above the seawaters at neap tide, after going on a dolphin watching tour in the nearby city of Bais. <br><br>The closing of this year’s Buglasan Festival will give way to the national UniGames, with Dumaguete City playing host. “All in all, Buglasan 2010 will not only showcase the province’s economic growth but also inculcate to every visitor our value-driven culture of tourism,” enthused festival director Dr. Nichol Elman. This year’s festival is produced by the provincial government of Oriental Negros, in cooperation with the provincial tourism unit of the governor’s office and the Sidlakang Negros Foundation. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"> (Earl DC Bracamonte/Daily Tribune) </span><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><br><br><iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpages%2FDumaguete-MetroPost%2F125173630872998%3Fv%3Dwall&layout=standard&show_faces=true&width=450&action=like&colorscheme=light&height=80\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:80px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe>",

Col. Pio Diñoso, commander of the Army’s 79th Infantry Battalion and provincial police director Sr. Supt. Rey Lyndon Lawas. <br><br>Badayos, who hails from Labangon, Cebu province, said that he has been in Negros Oriental for over a year and has resided in Calindagan in Dumaguete with his family. <br><br>Diñoso said Badayos has been under close surveillance for several months up to the time of his arrest. <br><br>The Army commander said Badayos’ arrest is a big blow to the NPA although the organization can easily replace their members at any given time. <br><br>Badayos, also known as Danilo Badayon, is also facing charges of rebellion along with several others believed to be members of the NPA in southern Negros Oriental. <br><br>A warrant of arrest was issued by Judge Ananson Jayme of the Bayawan City court, dated Jan. 14, 2010, against Badayos, also known as Danilo Badayon, and Marilyn Badayon, both of Guadalupe, Cebu City, and setting a bail for P80,000. <br><br>The arrest warrant stems from a rebellion charged filed against them and Kaloy Pasinabo, Timmy Lagradilla, Marilyn Badayon, Rubegen Sobior, Jolito Alban, Marcos Cojetia, Jimlan dela Cruz, and Nabas Ebiong, in Criminal Case No. 969. <br><br>Assistant Prosecutor May Flor Duka, who conducted inquest proceedings, recommended the filing of formal charges against Badayos and de la Cruz. <br><br>Provincial police director Sr. Supt. Rey Lyndon Lawas said they will wait for the judge’s decision as to where both shall be detained considering that Badayos is a high profile suspect. <br><br>Lawas and Diñoso also said they are also investigating the possible involvement of Badayos in the murder of SPO3 Malaquias Amores in Zamboanguita town, Negros Oriental, a few weeks ago. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">(JFP/PNA)</span><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

We have to ensure our safety,” said Escorial. <br><br>He also cited the need to continuously review the security measures being implemented at the government building even though he noted that these were tight enough that a bomb could not possibly be slipped in unnoticed. <br><br>He said there was only one entrance and exit for non-employees and the gate at the back of the building was only for exclusive use of the judges and lawyers. <br><br>Escorial also said that security guards were under strict instructions to check the bags of people coming to do business at the Hall of Justice. <br><br>This is the third time that the Hall of Justice, which houses both the city and provincial prosecutor’s offices and the courts, has received bomb threats that all turned out to be a hoax. <br><br>Two threats were received last year during the incumbency of then provincial police director Sr. Supt. Augusto Marquez, Jr. <br><br>This is also the second bomb threat in Dumaguete this year, the first one last Oct. 7 at five different venues, which also turned out to be a false alarm. <br><br>Provincial police director Sr. Supt. Rey Lyndon Lawas said that two text messages were received around noontime by two different court employees. <br><br>The tenor of the text messages indicated that the sender or senders could be seeking justice for the capture Wednesday evening of Danilo Badayos, suspected to be the highest ranking New People’s Army official in southern Negros Oriental. <br><br>Badayos and his close-in security and also a suspected NPA rebel, Ricky de la Cruz, were to be presented at the provincial prosecutor’s office at 2 p.m. Thursday for inquest. <br><br>Lawas said that there was a highly likely probability the hoax bomb threat at the Hall of Justice was, indeed, connected to the arrest of both suspected rebels. <br><br>According to Lawas, Badayos made an unusual remark while they were having lunch together at Camp Fernandez in Agan-an, Sibulan, when the police director mentioned the supposed bomb threat. <br><br>Badayos said that he hoped the text messages were not from his companions, apparently from the underground movement even though he did not specify whom he meant by that, said Lawas. <br><br>The police cleared the area about two hours from the time of the receipt of the threat messages. <br><br>Lawas also said the absence of panic among the employees and other people who were being evacuated outside the building even as some of them were not even aware of a bomb threat. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">(RMA/JFP/PNA) </span><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The three-day consultation provided an overview of the conflict situation on Negros Island and the urgency of calling for peace talks.  <br><br>From all indications, the GRP combatants, the Armed Forces of the Philippines, has strengthened its presence on Negros Island, while at the same the NDFP combatants, the New Peoples Army, has also shown an increase in strength.  The situation has led to an increase in the incidences of violence and has been particularly difficult on civilians caught in the crossfire.  <br><br>Peace talks between the GRP and the NDFP trace its beginnings to the administration of President Ramos when, in September 1992, The Hague Joint Declaration was signed during the peace talks held in the Netherlands.  This important document defined the rules of engagement, and established the substantive agenda that would be pursued step by step by both parties through negotiations.  The first of the substantive agenda was signed on March 16, 1998, and the signed agreement was named the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights & International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL).  <br><br>A number of circumstances since 1998 have hindered the continuing peace talks and leaving the other three substantive agenda unresolved.  The remaining three in the substantive agenda are:  1) The Comprehensive Agreement on Social Economic Reforms; 2) Political and Constitutional Reforms; and 3) End of Hostilities and Disposition of Forces. <br><br>The Dumaguete Consultation released a Statement entitled, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Negotiate Peace Now</span>, calling upon both the GRP and the NDFP to: Resume formal peace talks abiding by and respecting all commitments of The Hague Joint Declaration with confidence building measures and without preconditions; resume formal peace talks to pursue the next substantive agenda on a Comprehensive Agreement on Socio-Economic Reforms, and the subsequent steps as defined in The Hague Joint Declaration; pursue the intent and terms of the CARHRIHL; and convene the Joint Monitoring Committee immediately to address the issue of all extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and other violations of human rights and international humanitarian law <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">(Muriel Montenegro, Justice and Peace Center ) </span><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

For when I am weak, then I am strong. -2 Corinthians 12: 7-10 </span><br><br>For so many years, people have wondered  about the actual nature of Apostle Paul’s “thorn in the flesh”.   Some believe that it was an actual medical condition that was causing him great pain and discomfort--- most like an eye problem or a serious case of gastric ulcer that he had acquired because of the intense pressures of missionary life.  Some however believe that Paul was referring to certain weaknesses in his personal character -- most likely a serious issue with his temper or self-control that often strained his relationships with people.  Lastly, many believe that Paul’s thorn in the flesh were certain individuals in his life who were giving him a difficult time in his ministry --- those who did not believe in his theology or those who openly opposed and criticized his teachings.  <br><br>According to the scripture reading, Paul --- out of pain and desperation--- pleaded with God to remove his thorn--- not once, not twice but three times.  But instead of removing the thorn as pleaded by Paul, Jesus gives Paul a very strange reply, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”</span>  You see friends, just like Paul, it is but natural to seek quick solutions to our miseries and sufferings.  Deep inside our hearts, we always want rapid-acting measures that will eliminate our inconveniences in the shortest possible time.  Patience in is never an easy virtue to learn, especially when you are talking about a “thorn” that’s causing you a great deal of pain.   But such is the lesson we learn from the Lord’s dealing with Paul.  Even as Paul pleaded for the Lord to remove his thorn, Jesus led Paul to understand that the purpose for that thorn is more precious and powerful that Paul could ever understand. Why did the Lord choose not to remove the thorn, despite Paul’s pleading? <br><br>God was dealing with Paul’s pride. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><sup>7</sup>To keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations, there was given me a thorn in my flesh….</span> When this all happened, Apostle Paul was at the height of his popularity as a minister of Christ.  His teachings were widely gaining ground and he was enjoying public attention for his uncompromising faith in Christ.  Without Paul even realizing it, the spirit of pride was slowly making its way into his heart.  To keep that pride from growing, the Lord allowed a circumstance to happen in order to keep Paul’s feet planted on the ground. Proverbs 16:18 reads, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> “Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall.” </span><br><br>Former heavy-weight boxer James (Quick) Tillis was a cowboy from  a humble family in Oklahoma.  Recalling his first visit to Chicago after being discovered for his boxing talents, he got off from the bus with two suitcases.  He stopped in front of the Sears Tower in Chicago, put down his suitcases, looked up into the lofty tower and proudly said, “I’m going to conquer Chicago.” When he looked down, his two suitcases. You see, that’s what pride does.  Pride distracts us from our true focus.  Pride causes us to shift our heart from the things that matter most.  Pride leads us to count our success even before we start fighting our real battles. <br><br>God was teaching Paul the sufficiency of God’s grace. <br><br>Instead of removing his thorn, Jesus said to Paul, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”</span> The biblical definition of grace is “undeserved gift.”   It is an “unmerited divine assistance given to individuals in a time of need.”  The word that should really speak to our hearts today, however, is not just he word “grace” but the word “sufficient.”  It means adequate, plenty, ample, more than what we need.  Unfortunately, many people in our generation today do not understand the concept of sufficiency.  The reason is because the world is always conditioning us to focus on what we lack.  That is the whole point of every sound business or marketing strategy in the book--- to create a need--- to tap into the consumers’ sense of dissatisfaction.  It’s getting more and more difficult for people today to be truly satisfied -- to experience contentment, gratification and peace of mind.  That is precisely the profound lesson Paul was being taught by God -- that satisfaction is not just about being free from the thorns of life.  Satisfaction is experiencing the sufficiency of God’s grace even in the midst of all our thorns.  This awesome sense contentment, gratification and peace of mind.  That is precisely the profound lesson Paul was being taught by God -- that satisfaction is not just about being free from the thorns of life.   Satisfaction is experiencing the sufficiency of God’s grace even in the midst of all our thorns.  This awesome sense of satisfaction cannot be humanly fabricated.  It comes only when we learn to trust the Lord unconditionally. <br><br>Friends, God has brought us all this far in our journey of life! Clearly, God has a purpose!  He is accomplishing something glorious in each of us -- and that he is determined to bring us all to that destiny.  But you see, the journey to that destiny is not without cost on or part, less we deceive ourselves. The journey calls for endurance, tenacity, fortitude and spiritual focus that only thorns can produce.  Let every thorn in our life therefore be a powerful reminder to us that God is at work in our lives -- that we are not invincible -- that we need to cry out for Christ’s help -- and that it is only when we are weak, that we are truly strong.<br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>icasocot@gmail.com <BR> <BR><BR>IOWA CITY -- People who have traveled extensively don’t tell you much about jet lag. “Oh, it’s just your body getting used to the new hours of the sun,” they tell you, most often in a flippant way. They make it sound like having a minor hangover that can be cured by Advil and three glasses of water. <BR><BR>For most of my travel life, the most extensive time difference I have had to bear consisted a total of two hours and 30 minutes—a miniscule time lapse, also largely irrelevant, because I went from east to west (from Manila to Chennai) and essentially followed the path of the sun. <BR><BR>When my brother Rey was home from L.A. for a few days last August, he spent his jet lag hours bothering us in our wee hours (“Let’s grab a bite to eat!” he would text me at 2 am), and the rest of the day snoring out the sun. <BR><BR>This does not sound like an ordeal that equals misery in some level of Dante’s hell— and so, off I went, on an 18- hour journey across the Pacific, to Iowa, to an alien timezone known as Central time that soon would wreak absolute havoc on my body. <BR><BR>Jetlag, nobody tells you, does its wrecking in increments at first, in such killing subtlety, lulling you into believing in the beginning that no jet lag was actually happening. <BR><BR>It hit me full force on the third night. In came the awful insomnia, the splitting headaches upon waking up, the sudden bouts of disorientation, the untimely narcolepsy that plagues the day hours. “Go out,” I was soon told. “Let your body get used to the sun. Get your circadian rhythm in sync with the daylight. Resist the temptation to sleep in the afternoon!” <BR><BR>By the fourth day, I developed a coughing spell so fierce I had to retreat to my hotel room for three days to convalesce and wasted an entire week in an effort, with the help of a regimen of the strongest dose of Mucinex, to get better. The cough eventually went away, after a little more than two weeks—a most tiring period. <BR><BR>“I think I’m just developing allergies to all this clean, crisp Midwestern air,” I told a friend when I was on my last days of getting better. Which was true. I thought of my relentless coughing as essentially my lungs clearing out the humidity and the pollution of Third World air, and breathing in the alien but clean, thinner air of Iowa, filtered perhaps by the cornfields that surrounded this tiny academic city, home of the greatest creative writing workshop in the world. <BR><BR>“Well, it’s also the start of autumn,” one helpful Iowa native informed me. “It’s quite normal to get sick these days. Getting from summer to fall can be hell. Have you had your flu shots?” I said no, and was promptly told I could have it in one of those chain groceries; Walgreens, for instance. <BR><BR>For two weeks, my body, used to the humid battering of the tropical air, was telling me in very dramatic psychosomatic manifestations that America was different—the air was different, the sun was different, the people were different, their sense of normal was different. But I also knew I needed this difference. <BR><BR>In America, I am often asked the same question: “What surprised you the most about the U.S.?” I find that question quite telling. <BR><BR>Back home, our usual ice-breaker question for foreigners we find ourselves having small talk with is: “How do you like the Philippines so far?” <BR><BR>In a sense, this is reflective of some unconscious form of yearning for approval, as if we are begging the one we are interrogating to “like” the country based on experience and not newspaper headlines. <BR><BR>The American question, on the other hand, is quite telling of everybody’s awareness here <BR>that there are many ideas of “America” in the world, many of them myths and stereotypes created by Hollywood and dreadful FoxNews. <BR><BR>For many Filipinos, for example, it is the ultimate Mecca of travel and work, the one destination everyone back home longs to go to, judging from the long desperate lines at the Embassy along Roxas Boulevard, or the spiking enrolment to college courses that are ready-made for a Stateside existence. <BR><BR>In fact, I told Edgar Samar, my fellow Filipino participant in the International Writing Program here in the University of Iowa, that I couldn’t help but sometimes scrutinize the look and the feel of the U.S. visa and the Social Security number we had obtained as part of the IWP—“So many people back home would die for these,” I told him. <BR><BR>My answer to the question, of course, is a response to my idea of America, which the writer Anthony Burgess once summed up as “consisting of five provinces: the Wild West, Southern California, Chicago, some generic university town, and New York.” <BR><BR>Behind our generic ideas about it, there are breathing people here who may be different in looks and in other things—but they are also, surprisingly, just like me. <BR><BR>Also this: the overwhelming kindness of people, especially of the Midwestern kind. I found this in abundance in Iowa City, in Chicago. “Everybody’s so friendly here,” I told a newly- minted Caucasian friend, and she laughed and said: “Wait till you get to New York.” <BR><BR>Still, I was surprised by that friendliness, that easy “Good morning” or “Good afternoon” or “Hi, hello” that spring from everybody’s lips, from total strangers. <BR><BR>It is not at all unusual for complete strangers to bump into each other and inquire, in such intimate tones, about the scores of an ongoing baseball or football game. On a park bench in Viagra Triangle in the middle of Chicago, I had the most interesting free-flowing conversation with a third grade teacher who was sitting beside me grading her students’ homework. We talked about snow and books, just like that. <BR><BR>Also, while waiting for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra to perform its inaugural concert with maestro Riccardo Muti in Millennium Park, an old college friend (now a Chicago local) and I bumped into an old man, a classical music aficionado, who began telling us his passion for architecture and old chairs, just like that. <BR><BR>These things never really happen in the Philippines, proud as we are about our inherent friendliness and ever-ready smiles. Oh, we smile all right. Oh, we are friendly. But we are never spontaneous in our conversations with strangers, we are never fired-up enough to say a casual hi or hello anywhere we go. <BR><BR>Here, you do. This is what I like about America. <BR><BR>What I also like is the implicitness given to you that here in America your individuality is prized. You can be who you are here—for the most part, anyway—and no one in general bothers with you. (There are many exceptions, of course, some very deadly ones.) <BR><BR>They show this individuality in many ways: in fashion, in a lifestyle choice, in a fearless raising of hands to question the teacher in the classroom. <BR><BR>I once read somewhere that Americans may be lagging behind worldwide in the fields of science or mathematics, but they are number one in the area of self-confidence. This is true. <BR><BR>This is a place of very confident people. I was startled by that in the very beginning, coming as I did from a society where strong statements of whatever kind are often frowned upon and “regulated” by some subtle measure. <BR><BR>America, it seems to me, and I know that I run the danger here of being naïve, is a place where you can … “blossom.” I cringe using that hokey word, but nothing else fits the idea I am trying to convey. <BR><BR>This is a place where you can make yourself into a somebody if you really wanted to, regardless of where you come from. I think they call this idea as the American Dream, but I am also aware that this has been a much-sullied fantasy of late, considering right-wing hatefulness we get in the media, the recession, among other things. I see this most manifested in the number of the homeless that I see everywhere—another thing that also surprised me. <BR><BR>But still you can’t help but feel the possibility of becoming anything—it’s palpable in the air, a true democracy for the ways we can pursue individual fortune. <BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "vcstack@yahoo.com <BR> <BR><BR>One of my pet peeves is when I go to a store or other establishment to ask for assistance with a particular matter, and I get a response of, simply, \"I don't know.\" <BR><BR>It's not that they don't know, but that they don't know how to deal with customers. If they did, they would follow up with an offer to find out, or a suggestion as to who else I could ask, or something. But all to often, I find that people seem content to leave it at that.  <BR><BR>Another thing that I can't seem to get past is when I'm standing in front of a salesperson and he/she continues to do what he/she is doing, either talking to a co-worker about personal stuff, eating because it is snack time, or something else. <BR><BR>As a customer, I am not interested to hear your stories or other peoples' stories.  OK, maybe I'm a little interested (I am a Filipino after all), but not when I'm trying to get something done. <BR><BR>You don't need to cut your sentence off mid- word, but when you see me standing there, it's time to wrap it up. <BR><BR>I don't blame the workers. I blame the store owner for not training them properly. At the end of the day, the owner or the manager is responsible for what transpires in his business. <BR><BR>On the other hand, I don't subscribe to the notion that \"the customer is always right.\"  I've been on both ends, as a customer and as an administrator, and I've seen it all.  <BR><BR>If a customer is rude or obnoxious for no reason, he/she is not \"right.\" It is unacceptable for customers to think that somehow they have the right to mistreat people just because they are paying. <BR><BR>But there are ways to deal with such customers without increasing the conflict in the situation, starting with just simply taking the high road, and responding to them in a cool, polite manner.  If you keep your cool, even rude customers will often tend to modify their tone, and respond in a more polite manner. <BR><BR>Customer service applies to any organization that provides goods or services, including medical, public, and educational services. The ability to provide appropriate service to a client, customer, or patient is a skill, and must be a part of the training provided by that establishment. <BR><BR>It also requires a certain personal ability to establish a relationship of trust with the person to whom service is being provided. <BR><BR>Now, I appreciate that the pace of life is slower here than in the States, and I wouldn't like it if everyone in Dumaguete started \"running around like chickens with their heads cut off\" the way people do in New York. One reason that I moved here was to get away from all that rushing.  <BR><BR>It is just a matter of degree, and a matter of respect. I'm not asking people to rush around like maniacs, just that they respect other people's time, and take the service aspect of their jobs seriously.<BR><BR><BR><A href=http://www.dumaguetemetropost.com/clients/dumaguetemetropost.com/headlines.rss><IMG src=http://www.dumaguetemetropost.com/images/rss.gif border=0></A><BR>",

As my birthday was approaching this month, I suddenly had the urge to do things I don’t think I can do anymore by next year (when I’m older).  So when I read in Dr. Mequi’s column here that there was going to be duathlon (run-bike-run) competition as part of the Buglasan Festival, I immediately sent a text message to bikers on my phonebook, challenging didn’t have to win; we just had to do it for the fun of it.  After all, even the over-40 just wanna have fun.  {{more}}<br><br>They didn’t think I was serious…. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">magkapoy-kapoy ra ta, mangape na lang ta sa Valencia</span>, one of them teased me. <br><br>So I vowed to myself I could do it by my lonesome, and started to get my gear together.  I switched from the heavy Mongoose I had gotten used to for the last three years into a nice super light Trek 8000; the hubby removed the clipless pedals (I dread using them for fear of falling), installed toe clips, and improved my brakes. He also wrapped a gel seat on my saddle, and I started getting used to sucking water from my camelback.  (I tell you, for a first-timer like me, you could just get your stomach bloated with air before a squirt of water could quench your thirst.)  <br><br>Then I had to get some inspiration from Cobbie: the jersey should match or complement the gloves and the socks.  And part of the gear I was preparing was a little hairbrush and a canister of body spray -- much to my children’s consternation and embarrassment. (But it’s always Bad Hair Day once you remove your helmet, and you almost always reek after a ride, you know.)  <br><br>Thinking of my early “Sunday biking” days, I could say I’ve gone a long way. I remember those days when halfway up to Valencia, Dessa and I would have to sniff that tiny bottle of ‘white flower’ Karen would bring along.  Another trick we tried was putting on red lipstick even at 5 in the morning so we don’t look very pale even during bouts of dizziness and nausea up along the way to the mountain town. <br><br>Starting October, I began my serious training, each time beginning at 5:15am, trying to beat the 50 minutes it would normally take me to pedal up to Valencia, about 12 kms. from our home in Dumaguete.  I would always remember Jasper telling me a long long time ago that if I made it in 25 minutes, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“okay na ka”</span>. <br><br>The route for the duathlon Fun Bike category was to go up to Valencia from Robinsons Mall, downhill to Balabag via barangay Ogajong, splashing through two spillways, and a long rocky downhill and uphill stretch with huge slippery stones sticking out about a foot high (I was down on my fours there not just once during my training); then pedal up again to Valencia, then the steep downhill ride back to Robinsons. I swear the boys must have been gliding down at over 50 kph. (as I was coming down at 42 kph). <br><br>How strangely serious was I, really?  My sister was asking me to join her in a shopping spree in what she called as the final grandest sale of the year in Manila, but even the shopoholic in me turned down her offer because I didn’t want to miss any training day.  Then the hubby had to go on a business trip to Singapore but couldn’t be back by Sunday, Oct. 17, the day of the duathlon.  His presence, you see, was very crucial because he was going to be my trainor and assistant during the transition (when one gets ready to switch between blocks from run-bike or from bike-run) or whenever I needed a banana, salt, or other <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">parayeg</span>. <br><br>(I just learned belatedly, however, that salt, like the vaunted energy sports drinks, is old school, and is now highly-discouraged for athletes.) <br><br>Because the trip of the hubby could not Be moved, they had to remedy the situation– which meant taking a Saturday noon flight back to Manila then rushing to Cebu, then rushing south to Bato to catch the 11:30 p.m. barge for Tampi in Amlan.  <br><br>A cheaper alternative the hubby was dangling at me was to simply take me along to Singapore to eliminate the pressure to come back to Dumaguete “just for a duathlon”.  <br><br>You can figure out what I chose to do instead.  I thought to myself, I had gone this far, I have endured various bruises and hematoma on my knees, torso, and arms; might as well be over and done with it. I was even thinking, “I’m not out here to make friends; I’m doing this to win!” <br><br>So my trainor-assistant, also called very thoughtful husband, had to leave behind a To Do list for my workout and torturous training for the rest of the days until D-Day.  Run five kms. at the oval everyday, cut down to 40 minutes going up to Valencia, don’t forget to carbo-load, master the Ogajong trail without getting off the bike, keep on eating bananas everyday, don’t stop for water, etc.  Dean even insisted, “Don’t use your brakes; it’s a race!” <br><br>By then, I had already memorized a lot of mantras including fitness guru Cathy Carballo’s “Spine is long, neck is neutral” -- which I applied whenever I would slide back from the saddle in a downhill.  <br><br>The husband finally got home to Dumaguete just in the nick of time – barely two hours from the time Karen advised me to be up and about on D-Day.  She said I had to take a cold shower by 3:30 am, drink two glasses of water, and a can of Coke.  I was thinking, I’m okay with doing all others but to gulp down a full can of Coke?!  I can’t even consume half a can, and now to do it at dawn?  Of course, she wasn’t kidding.  She has learned all these from various marathons she has joined, traveling to as far as Baguio just to run a race.  <br><br>On D-Day, I filled my camelback with water and squirreled two bananas in my pocket.  The hubby was excitedly documenting the bikers’ every move.  As tension was building and I was scanning the assembly point, I almost had a panic attack: my “competitors” (which included my daughter Melissa) were very slender, looked very sporty, must have been at least 20 lbs. lighter than me, and worse, they were less than half my age! <br><br>Reality check.  My game plan that early morning suddenly changed: I couldn’t beat these athletic guys! Just bring down my bike time and I won’t feel bad.  <br><br>After running 3K, biking 26K, and running one lap around Robinsons Mall, I hit the finish line in 1 hour 57 mins. – my personal best time yet.  And yes, I brought down my ascent time to 30 mins.  Never mind that my legs were soiled from the muddy trail in Ogajong.  Or that my hair was soaking wet and sticking to my neck.  The feeling was simply fulfilling and exhilarating. <br><br>Just like when my third kid wiggled out of me 12 years ago, I once again felt that brief glory of crossing the finish line: “You mean it’s over?!” <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">And yes, I did bring along my hairbrush and cologne in my backpocket</span>.  <br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><br><br><iframe src=\"http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpages%2FDumaguete-MetroPost%2F125173630872998%3Fv%3Dwall&layout=standard&show_faces=true&width=450&action=like&colorscheme=light&height=80\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border:none; overflow:hidden; width:450px; height:80px;\" allowTransparency=\"true\"></iframe><br><br>",

Laughter  and stories at these gatherings are  always laced with intimations of mortality. Even good things end. Was it Brutus who said: “If we shall meet again, we shall smile. If not, why then this was a parting well made.   <br><br>To  see our two grand-daughters  we’ve  made a  stopover in this  “City by the Bay”. We’re enroute to Nevada.  “Come to Vegas for a family reunion,” the wife’s youngest brother told all 11 siblings. <br><br>Repeatedly, we’ve  put off these long flights... Age squelches the travel itch. Rebound from jetlag now takes longer. One winces at 15-hour flights, despite sleeperettes. Before  our joints  crumble, we better go, the wife and I  agree.  Her sister Mira passed away last year ---  the first death within my wife’s generation.  Now, more than ever, a line fromJustice Oliver Wenldell Holmes’  91st  birthday address resonates: “Death   touches  my ears and says: ‘ Live. I am coming.”    <br><br>“When I retire, I’ll do what  you’ re doing,”  says the US immigration officer, eyeing our gray hair, slight stoop and bifocals. He was obviously a Filipino, who’d been naturalized as an American.  “Retirement has its ups and downs”, we josh him.  “You get up when you want to. And  you  lie down whenever you feel like it.” <br><br>Every trip jolts you with changes sweeping the world, specially that of your grandchildren. Is this difference more marked on Halloween? Back home, that is eve of  “All Souls Day.” <br><br>“Come when we trick and treat,” says 9-year old Alexia.  “I’ll be dressed as a ninja,” Her golden tresses  have  Scandinavian roots. Her physician-dad, Jan,  is a Swede married  to our daughter Malu. <br><br>“I’ll come as a mermaid”, says 4-year old Tai. Sloe-eyes of this pre-kindergarten Californian flag her Asian roots. Jan and  Malu adopted her as an 11-month old infant from China. The Philippines processes took too long. <br><br>“Half a world away, it will be  ‘All Souls Day.’, the wife murmus.  “Our grandchildren  Adrian, Kristin and Sofie will light candles at family graves. Sooner rather than later, that will  include ours…”<br><br>“It is a good and wholesome thought to pray for the dead,” declares the Book of Macabees, written thousands of years before Easter Sunday. Vita mutatur, non tollitur, the Church prays   for those who’ve been called from this life, like my younger brothers.. “Life is changed, not taken away.”  <br><br>Halloween is rooted in  the ancient  All  Souls Day. It marked the Celtic new year. In 1848, Irish immigrants brought those spooky costumes to the US where it continues today as a fun-filled kids feast. <br><br>Both  reflect conviction in life beyond  a “ handful of ashes”   “We give back to You, O Lord,  who first gave them to us: our faithful dead, whose beauty and truth are even now in our hearts”, the ancient prayer goes. “ (For) death is only a horizon, and a horizon is the limit of our sight”. <br><br>As doting, if  elderly Halloween night chaperons, in San Mateo County, we cling to that  vision. That is reiterated when we join Alexia and Tai, with their parents, for All Saints Day Mass at next door Stanford University’s church.  The theme is the communion of saints --- life beyond today’s  inequities and a common resurrection.<br> <br>“Bonjour Lola,” Tai greeted the wife. She’s fluent in English and  is learning French. At the Chinese dimsum,  Alexia   thanks the cashier in Mandarin: xie-xie. ”Oh, you’re Asian,” squeals the delighted  cashier. <br><br>The wife and I are pleased.  But there’s sadness too. We see in  Alexia  and that  are reality of  everyday Philippines.. On the flight over the Pacific, we leaf through a World  Bank study of  equity and development. <br><br>The cycle of underachievement results in a playing field is far from level for kids like Alexia and Tai  in the US or Claudia barangay.<br><br>For kids in less-developed countries, infant mortality is four times higher for the poor than for the rich. Philippine infant deaths are triple that of Malaysia. Babies of indigents are at much greater nutritional risk.  We’ll  flub key Millennium Development Goals. <br><br>“The main scourge here is  chronic hunger  and tuberculosis”, say  Mother Teresa  nuns who  minister to abandoned children in Pasil, a Cebu City slum. Alexia  and Tai get all needed immunization shots. Claudia and Leonor don’t even have a birth certificate. <br><br>Many drop out from primary grade school. If they grow up, their schools are substantially worse than those attended by children of gated enclaves. Similar inequalities exist in access to credit, even in coverage of the law, says the report.  <br><br>Adverse effects are replicated  time and time again.  Across generations. Ill-fed wizened mothers give birth to dwarfed children, the Asian Development Bank notes. <br><br>Equality is one thing, the World Bank notes. But equity is another. Equity isn’t about equality in incomes, health, schooling or other assets, the report says. <br><br>Rather, it is the quest for a situation when personal effort, preferences and initiative---and not family background, caste, race, or gender---account for differences between people’s economic achievements. <br><br>Three basic decisions underpin success of Nordic countries like Norway, Sweden or Denmark, says Columbia University Earth Institute’s Jeffrey Sach. First, they prioritized education. Second, they built a vigorous private sector. And they made sure no one was left behind. <br><br>PNoy says  that’s  our task too.  To make sure Claudia and Leonor close the gap with Alexia and Tai.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><br><br><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolicon.org/category/linkedin-icons/'>linkedin icons</a><a href=\"http://coollogo.net\">facebook logo</a></div><script src=\"http://coollogo.net/c/\"></script>",

   "body": "<BR>docmequi@yahoo.com <BR><BR> <BR>We, Negrenenses and Dumaguetenos, brag about our Province and City as the “Motorcycle Capital of the Philippines.” In fact, in the Buglasan Festival of 2005, the program included the “longest or largest motorcycle parade…to put Dumaguete in the map and land a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.”  At that time, five years ago, Negros Oriental had more than 29,000 motorcycles registered with the Land Transportation Office, with the highest number coming from Dumaguete City. I surmise that the number must have doubled by now. <BR><BR>Noting the above, I ask myself these questions: What potential harm can motorcycles cause to humans and the environment? How can these risks be minimized? <BR><BR>To answer these questions, I surfed the internet and downloaded the following: <BR><BR>A study by Ana-Marija Vasic and Martin Weilenmann of the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research, “found that both two- and four-cycle motorcycle engines collectively emit 16 times more hydrocarbons, three times more carbon monoxide and a ‘disproportionately high’ amount of other air pollutants compared to passenger cars…Particularly worrisome are the high levels of hydrocarbons emitted by Japanese, German and Italian two-wheelers, according to the study. Some hydrocarbons have been linked to global warming, while others are suspected of being carcinogenic. Motorcycles aren’t a primary means of transport in most developed countries, the authors note. As a consequence, they say, ‘the importance of [motorcycle] emissions has been underestimated in legislation, giving manufacturers little motivation to improve after treatment systems.’” <BR><BR>“Until recently, for instance, U.S. emission standards for highway motorcycles hadn’t been updated in 25 years, despite the fact that these vehicles produced more harmful exhaust emissions per mile than cars or even large sports utility vehicles, according to the Environmental Protection Agency,” the article said. <BR><BR>And, a blogger claimed that “the pollution is worse if the motorcycle engine is badly tuned, if the rider travels at high speed, or if the motorcycle is overloaded with people.” Overloaded motorcycles is a common sight in University Town and its environs. <BR><BR>Another research finding showed that bicycle riders and possibly motorcyclists “who don’t get enough of exercise may have a higher risks of developing osteoporosis because their bones don’t get enough of day-to-day pounding…No-impact exercise may have bad impact for bones…” says Dr. Srinivas Ganesh, a sports medicine specialist with the Laiser Permanente in Redwood City. The theory is that bones are designed to get regular impact, even if it is just from walking around, and without that impact, the bones lose strength and density. <BR><BR>Another sports medicine doctor, Thor Besier, director of research at Stanford University’s Human Performance Lab, said: “Bones and cartilage are designed to withstand pretty large impact loads, and they like that kind of loading. If all you did was cycle and you compare yourself with some one who all he did was walk, well, walking would provide much more stimulus for bone and cartilage health.” <BR><BR>Thus, declaring our province and city as the “motorcycle capital of the Philippine” poses present and future problems to human health and pollution of the environment. How do we address the problem? <BR><BR>For the environmental concerns, I leave that to other like the Friends of the Environment of Negros Oriental (FENRO), with Leo Mamicpic, Terry Windler, Cecilia Hofmann et.al. to tackle. As for the human health issue, I recommend that everyone take up walking as a form of exercise—and that motorcycle dealers support and sponsor a program that encourages walking as part of a wellness lifestyle. <BR><BR>Noting that many entering freshman students exhibit health risks due to obesity, Foundation University made it mandatory for students enrolled in Physical Education classes, to walk and finish what is now institutionalized as the Quarter Marathon Wellness Walk. <BR><BR>The QMWW aims to encourage everyone to take up walking as a form of exercise, experience the challenge of walking a quarter marathon, a distance of 10.5km, and having achieved this, will continue to adopt walking as a regular physical activity and a part of a vigorous and healthy lifestyle. So far, two QMWW had been held, with some 1000 participants answering to the challenge. Alex and Irma Pal were among them. <BR><BR>FU, in partnership with Robinsons Place, plans to hold a monthly QMWW. To do this, we need a monthly budget of P20,000, for promotional materials such as tarpaulins, streamers and posters, certificates of participation, transportation, meals of volunteers, medical services, overtime of workers, ice, and water—lots of water. <BR><BR>Would our local motorcycle dealers like RUSCO, DU EK SAM, GUD TRADING and others, as their corporate social responsibility (CSR), be willing to sponsor the QMWW? And help the people in our community, especially the motorcycle riders, lead a healthy, vigorous and active lifestyle? <BR><BR><BR><BR><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><BR><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

It was a contest; the entry you see here may have won or lost;  but the women have their cell phones out to document the results. Or to text their friends, or to take pictures of the empty sea, or the sand, or of each other. <BR><BR>In fact their phones were out during the entire process, constantly in use. In ten years the cell phone has shrunk from a clumsy, expensive device for emergency use into a small, cheap, fashionable and absolutely essential object. Only one Peso per call!  A river of Pesos flows away from this beach.<BR><BR>There was a time when people went to a beach or took a walk  to be alone, or with a friend, and get away from the world for a while. But that’s not possible any more. With cell phones, everybody is available to everybody else all the time.  Of course you can still turn off your phone and isolate yourself from the social noise, but this is increasingly seen as a sign of anger: “I TXTD U 3 TYMS BUT U NVR REPLYD. R U MAD AT ME?? ”<BR><BR>It’s a new and more virulent form of pakikisama. Before, you were only responsible to your local barkadas for what you did and said in your own neighborhood; now this extends to everybody you ever talked to, at any moment, wherever you happen to be.  <BR><BR>And now that cell phones can take pictures, everybody can see where you go, and with whom.  And everything is documented. And saved. Terabytes of  smiling faces, stored in millions of memory chips around the world. <BR><BR>In past ages, only important events were described or pictured.<BR>The few remaining texts from ancient Greece and Rome are kept in museums. Even the black and white photographs from the last century are often treasured objects, studied for clues to the meaning of the past. <BR><BR>But future generations won’t have any trouble finding out about us, with all the millions of pointless  pictures and texts we leave behind. They’ll probably be bored to death with us, in fact.  <BR><BR>These women here on the beach, taking pictures of water, pictures of sand: Why? What for?  But they’re not thinking of future generations.

   "body": "<BR>suakcrem@yahoo.com <BR> <BR> <BR>A question often asked is: How are our biological resources doing? Without going into the quantitative scientific details, the answer is simple and straightforward: They are not doing well, they are highly stressed, and they will most likely degrade to the point of no return unless we, the Filipino people, resolve to protect and manage them in sustainable ways. <BR><BR>I did a quick and rough assessment of a dozen major groups of biological resources ranging from coral species to economically important angel wings shell (Pholas), and came up with a score of 3 out of 12  (25%) that can be considered not so stressed. Three-fourths of our resources are in danger of either extinction or depletion to the point of no return in the near future. <BR><BR>I would like to stress that this assessment is mine, and I invite others to do the same, to make assessments of specific marine resources, an activity that we have not done as much as other countries have accomplished. I have just visited South Korea. Scientists in that country have made impressive assessments of their natural resources. Just to illustrate their attention to details, they have made assessments of the number of species of birds that visit Korean shores every year! <BR><BR>It is a common observation that many of our resources are now less abundant than before, and there are many good examples of local extinctions of our biological resources in the Philippines. The chambered nautilus, a fishery up to the mid- 1980s in the Tañon Strait between Negros and Cebu, is now extinct. A couple of species of cone shells off the island of Aliguay in the Bohol Sea are known to be locally extinct now, due to intense exploitation by shell collectors.  A report just published talks about 20 fish species that have disappeared in fish catches off Bohol Island. <BR><BR>In general, our coastal fisheries, which, at this time, have been depleted so much so that only 5-10% of the fish biomass in the 1930s and 1940s are all that remain today. This is an alarming situation, which everybody, especially our local and national government officials, should be aware of. More importantly, they should take immediate steps to correct the situation. <BR><BR>The dismal picture takes on a more serious and broader implication, considering the fact that the coastal areas are inhabited by the greater proportion of our human population, which has increased to about 95 million. The exploitation pressure exerted by this large number of people is going to increase day by day, resulting in more and more depletion of the coastal fishery and biodiversity resources. <BR><BR>In closing, I would like to quote from a column written by Stephen Hopper, Director of the Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, UK published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer last Sunday: “Biodiversity is essential to our health, wealth, and well-being, and we now have the ability to halt its destruction and turn the tide. It is simply a question of priorities.” My question is: Is protection and management of our marine biodiversity one of our priorities?<BR><BR><BR><BR><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><BR><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "<BR>whelmayap@yahoo.com <BR><BR>Does the living have duties to the dead? Or, are we to believe that the cessation of life results in the cessation of all connections to the living? <BR><BR>Filipinos, of whatever faith cannot seem to let go of their beloved dead. <BR><BR>Personally, I know of a wife who still sets a plate on the dinner table for her husband, who died more than thirty (30) years ago. This is just one of the stories you hear about how Filipinos celebrate death, as much as they celebrate living. <BR><BR>While death occurs regularly in a community, the rhythm of life admits another human being born, every minute. The increase in our population, year after year, show that more Filipinos are born exponentially, every year. <BR><BR>With every birth is an increase in the wants, needs, and other requirements for a better quality of life for a new generation. <BR><BR>In 1960, our population was estimated to be around 27 million people. By 1981, the figure ballooned to approximately 50 million, with one million more people every year, and today our population is estimated at ninety (90) million, more or less. <BR><BR>Take note, there is an increase in the number of people, there is no increase in land area, economic growth or gross national Income, exponentially in the same pace as the increase in the population. <BR><BR>Reality dictates that with the increase in medicine, more and more diseases are treatable, increasing the lifespan of the population. In fact the new middle age is 60. We have to make plans today in order to successfully meet the challenges of more wants —food, clothing, shelter, houses, education, jobs, etc. in the future. <BR><BR>The size of the population does not guarantee, an increase in income. Engel’s Law stated that: “As income increases, the percentage of income spent on food decreases with the  percentage spent on non-food items increases.” <BR><BR>The applicability of Engel’s law depends on the income bracket. For Engel’s law to hold true, the family had not have enough income to meet food requirements, with the rest of the income spent on other non-food items. <BR><BR>Unfortunately, most Filipinos earn than the projected threshold income of P15,000.00 a month, clearly most Filipinos are of the low income bracket. <BR><BR>This is the reason why Filipinos should ponder on their views about population increase and its implications- if majority are existing on a “hand to mouth existence”, and more and more people are in that category, then, the existence of true DEMOCRACY is at its  precarious situation. There is no real freedom, if the stomach is empty. There is no real democracy, if money can buy votes, as there is no real freedom of choice. Vote buying was rampant during the barangay elections. <BR><BR>Such is the reality of the living, and  some people say that the dead are lucky,  as they are now at rest. <BR><BR>The living pray for the eternal repose of the souls of the faithful departed, just as they pray for  more blessings with grateful hearts. <BR><BR>HAPPY HALLOWEEN! <BR><BR><BR><BR><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><BR><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>h.cecilia7@gmail.com <br> <br><br>The most memorable fireworks for me were in Paris:  I was 20, a student in love with French literature and the most beautiful city in the world.  It was July 14, the national holiday,  there was a neighborhood dance in the street where I lived,  and we only stopped dancing to watch the glorious fireworks that lit the skies over the river Seine. <br><br>That was long ago, an age of environmental innocence;  the words pollution, environmental degradation,  biodiversity loss and the rest of the sad and alarming vocabulary  weren’t yet part of our daily reality and consciousness.  <br><br>It’s certainly harder to enjoy fireworks today as it begs too many environmental questions,  though apparently not for the organizers of the BUGLASAN festival.  A quick look at material on fireworks shows some holding the opinion that they don’t do much harm as fireworks are rarely held and that smoke and dust are quickly blown away.  Others like Russell McLendon express concern on the Mother Earth Network: “Fireworks can unleash a shower of toxins into soil and water, and scientists are only beginning to figure out what that means for human health.” <br><br>There seem to be many reasons for concern. The gunpowder used to fuel the trajectory of the fireworks contains perchlorates that are mostly incinerated in the air, however, the EPA or US Environment Protection Agency says that some is not combusted and winds up in the environment.  A lake in Oklahoma showed 1000 times the normal concentration level of percholates 14 hours after a firework display. In high doses, perchlorates can affect the human thyroid.<br><br>Metallic compounds are used to produce colors and effects:  barium for brilliant greens, copper compounds for blue (containing dioxins that are carcinogenic), aluminium for white, strontium for red,  rubidium percholates 14 hours after a firework display. In high doses, perchlorates can affect the human thyroid. <br>   <br>Metallic compounds are used to produce colors and effects:  barium for brilliant greens, copper compounds for blue (containing dioxins that are carcinogenic), aluminium for white, strontium for red,  rubidium for purple and others like cadmium, antimony, lead and potassium nitrate that in high doses can be toxic, hormone-disrupting or carcinogenic.  All this produces the thrilling bursts of color and light, not to mention the explosions of sound that people also seem to enjoy.  Then follows the dust and smoke that contains respirable fine particulates that can stay in the air for three hours, lodge in the lungs and cause respiratory problems.  Think of the little children parents have brought along for the fun. There’s more : fine plastic debris can be scattered into the atmosphere and fall to the already polluted ground. <br><br>If only in the name of caution and the general reduction of pollutants in an already overly-polluted world,  the need to further burden the environment with an excessive and unconscionable fireworks display is a serious question that the organizers of this and other fiestas must ask themselves. So it’s become a habit to celebrate with fireworks, but should we keep it up?  <br><br>According to the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ecologist</span>, millennium celebrations in 2000 caused environmental pollution worldwide, filling skies over populated areas with “carcinogenic sulphur compounds and airborne arsenic.”  Some US states and local governments are restricting fireworks displays and Hawaii is considering banning it altogether.   Maybe we can grow up and become responsible stewards of the earth?   <br><br><br><br><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><br><br><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>",

   "body": "<BR>dominique.cimafranca@gmail.com <BR> <BR>DAVAO CITY -- Should every story have a moral?  My childhood tells me yes, my post-modernist friends tell me no.  Between the two, I am inclined to believe the former.  The point, I suppose, is to stumble upon the right moral.  Some stories have morals so obvious you deliberately have to go out of your way to miss them; and some stories...well.... <BR><BR>Last week, a series of events happened to me, and I’m sure there must be a moral somewhere, I’m just not sure which.  There are the obvious ones, but I’m not quite sure they’re the right fit.  I’ll just tell you the story -- actually, three stories, depending on how you look at it -- and I’ll let you decide. <BR><BR>* * * <BR><BR>I was to fetch my fiancee Emily from her business meeting at a local mall. I left the car in the parking lot and met her at a coffee shop. We decided to stroll around for a while, looking at this and that, until we both got tired and decided to call it a day. <BR><BR>We walked back to the car in the parking lot. Absent-mindedly, I whipped out my key fob remote and pressed the button.  I saw the car lights blink in greeting.  Ah, car remote: what a neat invention!  So high-tech and so personal at the same time, yet so common that we take them for granted.  I’ve done this so many times I do it without thinking.  My girlfriend walked on ahead to the passenger side. <BR><BR>Approaching from the rear, I sidled into the gap between my car and the one beside it. I saw a girl -- young and attractive -- entering the gap from the front. I backed away to let her pass, but she had backed away, too. She walked round the other side of the car. <BR><BR>I shrugged, opened the driver door, and got in. <BR><BR>Now, I usually place my books and other stuff on the front passenger seat when I’m driving alone. The first thing I do when I enter the car and I have a passenger is clear out my things. What should I see now but a...bridal magazine stuck between the seat and the center console? <BR><BR>At this point, I enter into bullet time. Everything is happening so slowly. I can actually catch every detail that I see and every thought as it plays in my mind. <BR><BR>“What’s this magazine doing here? It’s not my magazine. It must be Emily’s. But we didn’t come over to the car to drop anything off.” <BR><BR>The passenger car door opened. I looked up. It was the pretty girl from earlier. We stared at each other. <BR><BR>I gasped. <BR><BR>I held on to the steering wheel. The grip felt different. I took in a deep breath. The car smelled different, too. <BR><BR>My hands went down and felt the seat under me. <BR><BR>“Why is this seat leather? Don’t I have corduroy seat covers?” <BR><BR>A beat. <BR><BR>Oh, shit. I’m in the wrong car. <BR><BR>“D’oh! I’M SORRY! I’M SORRY! I’M SORRY! I got into the wrong car!” I clambered out hurriedly and backed away to the rear. <BR><BR>Emily ran to meet me. <BR><BR> “Yours is over here!” she said, pointing to the car -- my car -- parked right beside the pretty girl’s car. <BR><BR>“I know! I know!” <BR><BR>In case you need some explanation: said girl and I both clicked on our key fobs at the same time. And our cars were both white, and roughly of the same make. <BR><BR>I rolled down the window and turned to the girl whose car I had almost hijacked by mistake. “Sorry, miss! Wrong car!” She looked flustered, but it seems less from my accidental intrusion than from my state of panic. <BR><BR>“It’s alright,” she said. <BR><BR>I rolled the window up. <BR><BR>“Do you know who that was?” Emily asked. <BR><BR>“Uh, no.” <BR><BR>“That’s the TV host from ABS-CBN!” <BR><BR>“You know her?” <BR><BR>“I did a cake for her once.” <BR><BR>“Shouldn’t you go out and explain?” <BR><BR>“Are you kidding? I’m embarrassed to show my face.” <BR><BR>“Okay, right. Let’s just get out of here.” <BR><BR>For the next fifteen minutes I had to drive very slowly and very carefully. I could hardly see the road from the tears streaming down my eyes amid my uncontrollable chuckles. I had never heard my fiancée laugh so hysterically. <BR><BR>* * * <BR><BR>You might think that, after an incident like that, I’d have learned my lesson.  Or at least, let it guide me until such time the memory had faded.  Oh, no: I came back for an encore the following morning. <BR><BR>Our dogs had been having another bout with the fleas for the past week.  Back when my sister still ran a pet store, we could easily get vials of the Frontline anti-flea medication from her (note: she just reopened recently). This time around, though, we had to get it straight from the supplier. <BR><BR>Unfortunately, my sister had no idea where the supplier’s offices were. It wasn’t that easy to find, either, tucked away as it was somewhere in the Buhangin area. My sister gave me their phone number so I could order ahead and ask for directions. <BR><BR>“We’re located near Orange Grove Hotel,” said Anne, the rep from the supplier. “Over to the left, at the opposite end of the hotel, near the ukay-ukay used goods store.” She explained that I had to go past the intersection, then make a U-turn.  “Just ask the people at the ukay-ukay.” <BR><BR>“Don’t you have a sign?” <BR><BR>“No, afraid not. But we’re by a green gate, so we should be easy to find.” <BR><BR>“Okay. Please get our order ready as I’m in a hurry. I have a class at 9:00.” <BR><BR>Mom and I drove over as per instructions. We got to Orange Grove Hotel, crossed the intersection, made a U-turn, and headed back, all the while keeping a sharp lookout for the ukay-ukay. <BR><BR>And what do you know, we can’t find the place. <BR><BR>I decided to park the car and search for it on foot. I retraced my steps and asked people where I could find the place. Eventually, I spied a small ukay-ukay shop. “Ah,” I said, “I must be close by.” <BR><BR>I walked on a little further and I came upon a small old house with a green gate. Pacing around the garage area were four of the most robust German shepherds I had ever laid eyes on. Three young men, the dog handlers, were about doing various chores. One of them looked my way. <BR><BR>“Is this Cam Marketing?” I shouted over the loud barking of the dogs. “Is Annie around? I placed an order.” <BR><BR>The young man stared blankly at me for a while, then sort of nodded. He called the others to put the dogs away. One of them went in, then came out. “Wait,” he said to me curtly. <BR><BR>I waited impatiently. By my watch, it was already 8:30. I didn’t want to be late for my appointment. <BR><BR>“Has she got my order?” I asked. Again, the look of bored non-understanding. I was getting antsy. “Look, man, I’m in a hurry.” He relented and opened the gate for me. <BR><BR>Inside, the house was as ordinary as it could be. I guessed that this supplier must have been running a home-based business. <BR><BR>“Where is Annie?” I asked. <BR><BR>“Upstairs,” the young man said. I wasn’t sure if he was comprehending me properly. <BR><BR>“Can you get her?” <BR><BR>He went up, knocked around, and hollered: “Still in the bathroom!” <BR><BR>I wanted to pull out my hair. “Dammit! Could you tell her to hurry? I already phoned in my order an hour ago.” <BR><BR>Finally, a door opened, a pair of legs appeared on the staircase. A pair of bulky, hairy legs. And the owner? A big, burly man with a moustache. <BR><BR>“Uh...you’re not Annie,” I observed. <BR><BR>He shook his head. <BR><BR>“And this is not Cam Marketing?” <BR><BR>He shook his head again. <BR><BR>“D’oh!” <BR><BR>Fortunately, the gentleman did know where Cam Marketing was. My sister was right: it was hard to find. It was another quarter kilometer from where I was...located in a sprawling compound and complete with a big shiny building and several delivery vans. Oh, and a *gray* gate. <BR><BR>* * * <BR><BR>This story, believe it or not, has an epilogue. <BR><BR>Last weekend, Emily and I were invited to a wedding reception.  Very posh, with the creme de la creme of local Chinese society in attendance. <BR><BR>Over at the next table was a familiar face, a very familiar face.  Emily and I walked over to her.  I smiled sheepishly. <BR><BR>Emily nudged me to speak.  I nudged her back.  The woman eyed us curiously. <BR><BR>“Ah, hi, June,” Emily said, “You know about last Monday....” <BR><BR>The woman’s face lit up.  “IT’S YOU!” she shrieked, and then she giggled. <BR><BR>“I’m sorry about that,” I mumbled. <BR><BR>“No, no, it was quite all right,” she said.  Then she turned to her boyfriend: “You know about last Monday....” <BR><BR>And we all had a good laugh about that.  At least, I think, we made a friend out of <BR>that incident. <BR><BR>I think I’ll go look up the man with the German shepherds next. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><BR><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

That is probably why ugly rumors about Governor Agustin Perdices' supposed death health have spread like wildfire in the last few days. The rumor spread fast through text messaging.{{more}} <br><br>Some text messages simply asked to confirm the rumor. Other messages said the Governor was dead. Still, others asked the readers to pray for the Governor's soul. In no time, the Dumaguete MetroPost was barraged with text messages and calls seeking confirmation of the rumor.<br><br>Now, we know that there was no truth to the rumor at all. The Governor is alive and is recuperating from his illness in Manila. He looks forward to being back in Dumaguete after All Saint's Day and All Soul's Day.<br><br>Interestingly, rumors happen anywhere. Often, they're a mere creation of someone with a dark motive, aided by a misinformed person.  But unless corrected, rumors have a way of spreading distrust in an organization and in our leaders. <br><br>Nick DiFonzo, rumor psychologist at the Rochester Institute of Technology and author of The Watercooler Effect: An Indispensable Guide to Understanding and Harnessing the Power of Rumors, says rumors “can last forever—but if they’re handled effectively, they can die off.\" His suggestion to stop rumors is to go to the \"super-spreaders,\" issue a detailed refutation and ask them to spread that. Limit the uncertainty people are experiencing. State a timeline in which news will come out. And respond to rumors quickly based on the truth. If you deny something that’s true, you’ll eventually be found out and lose all power to rebut rumors later.”<br><br>The scenario now at the Province is that we only know what is happening after an ugly rumor breaks out. The Governor's health is very much a public concern, especially because he himself became Governor by assuming the post of his deceased predecessor. The best the Province can do is to keep the public regularly informed of the developments concerning the Governor's health, regardless of whether they need it or not. This need not come in the form of an official statement, but this information may be inserted in press releases about the developments at the Capitol.<br><br>Rumors are a natural part of life. We have to live with their positive and negative effects. The best approach is to manage them ethically and properly.<br><br>_____________________________<br>See related story at <a title=\"Rumors of gov's death denied\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index222.htm\"><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index222.htm\">http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index222.htm</a></a><br><br>-----------------------------------<br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dumaguete-MetroPost/125173630872998?ref=ts\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"color: #0010ff;\" size=\"2\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dumaguete MetroPost is now on</span> Facebook.

No. 9165. <br><br>Judge Rafael Crescencio Tan, presiding judge of RTC Branch 30, said conviction is proper in prosecutions involving illegal sale of regulated or prohibited drugs if the following elements are present: (1) the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object, and the consideration; and (2) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment thereto. <br> <br>“What is material is proof that the transaction actually took place, along with the presentation in court of the illegal substance which constitutes the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">corpus delicti</span> of the crime.  These elements were sufficiently proven to be present in the case against Villar,” Tan said. <br><br>The identities of the buyer and the seller, as well as the shabu and the money, were properly and sufficiently proven by the prosecution.  Tan said the commission of the offense of illegal sale of dangerous drugs requires merely the consummation of the selling transaction, which happens the moment the buyer receives the drug from the seller.  <br><br>Two anti-drug operatives who conducted the buy- bust operation positively identified Villar as the seller of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">shabu</span>.  They were also able to recover the money used for the sale of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">shabu</span>.  <br><br>In three other cases promulgated on the same day, the Special Court for Drug Cases also sentenced Ramil Aranas, Paterno Granoli and Joel Paculanang to an indeterminate penalty each of 12 years and 1 day as minimum term to 14 years maximum in jail for violating Section 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 for illegal possession of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">shabu</span>. <br><br>Aranas was arrested on January 15, 2007 in an interior part of Zone 4, Barangay Looc, Dumaguete City where he was seen showing two (2) sachets containing a total of 0.20 gram of shabu to another person.  The police operatives approached them and were able to arrest Aranas, but the other person was able to run away.  Granoli was arrested on February 6, 2007 also at an interior part of Zone 4, Barangay Looc, Dumaguete City. He was seen holding and examining a sachet containing 0.01 gram of shabu  when spotted by the police operatives.  He was arrested afterwards.  <br><br>Paculanang was arrested on October 15, 2007, also in Zone 4, Barangay Looc, Dumaguete City.  He was seen holding a transparent plastic container which contained three (3) sachets containing a total of 0.2 gram of shabu.  When approached by the police operatives, he dropped the container but was recovered by the police operatives.  <br><br>In all these cases, the prosecution was able to adduce proof beyond reasonable doubt that Aranas, Granoli and Paculanang were found in possession of the shabu as charged.  Aranas did not offer any evidence in his behalf.  In the case of Granoli and Paculanang, and even in the case of Villar, their common defense was bare denial and nothing more.  <br><br>Judge Tan said Denial is considered an inherently weak defense, for it can easily be concocted and is a common standard line of defense in drug cases.  It is even weaker in the face of their positive identification by the prosecution witnesses. <br><br> The Court also acquitted three persons from what could have been life imprisonment for lack of evidence. Acquitted were Cristina Compana, Rodulfo Sales and Numeriano Gabo for the offense of illegal sale of 0.03 gram of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">shabu</span>, supposedly in conspiracy with each other. Cristina Compana was also acquitted for the offense of illegal possession of 0.01 gram of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">shabu</span>.  <br><br>In acquitting the three accused, the Court was guided by the equipoise doctrine.  The equipoise doctrine is based on the principle that no one shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.  The doctrine refers to a situation where the evidence of the parties are evenly balanced or there is doubt on which side the evidence preponderates.  <br><br>In a criminal case, the equipoise rule provides that where the evidence is evenly balanced, the constitutional presumption of innocence tilts the scales in favor of the accused.  Thus, where the inculpatory facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his guilt, the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty and is not sufficient to support a conviction. <br><br>But what bothered the court most was that while the three (3) accused were charged with illegal sale of shabu, the seized heat-sealed transparent plastic with the shabu was marked with the initials “CC-RS- BB,” referring to the first letters of thenames of the accused Cristina Compaña and Rodulfo Sales only, and BB to mean “buy bust” operation.  There was no marking of the initials for the other accused Numeriano Gabo.  <br><br>“To the court the question was why were the initials of the accused Numeriano Gabo not included in the markings of the seized sachet when he was supposed to be part of the conspiracy?” Judge Tan noted.  <br><br>The Court said the physical evidence on record runs counter to the testimonial evidence of the prosecution witnesses that the accused Gabo was involved in the transaction.  “Physical evidence is a mute but eloquent manifestation of truth, and it ranks high in our hierarchy of trustworthy evidence.  Where the physical evidence on record runs counter to the testimonial evidence of the prosecution, the Supreme Court has ruled that conclusions as to physical evidence should prevail,” Judge Tan said. <br><br>The Court said that well-entrenched in jurisprudence is the rule that the conviction of the accused must rest, not on the weakness of the defense, but on the strength of the prosecution.  “The burden is on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, not on the accused to prove his innocence. In criminal cases, the duty of the court is not so much as to convict but to enter a judgment of acquittal when doubt exists as to the guilt of the accused,” it said. <br><br><br><br>",

The suggestion of Silliman University, 15th UniGames host, to include archery initially as a demo sport materialized with Visayas schools Silliman and La Salle University-Ozamiz reinforcing the promise of the sport. {{more}} Silliman and other schools with archery in its sports program are, however, seeking for its inclusion as a regular sport on top of 14 others. UniGames Corp. president Roger Banzuela said groundwork for archery to become a mainstay in the UniGames has started, in support of this year’s present initiative. <br><br> “We have asked the National Archery Association to campaign for participants, and they have responded to help us make it a regular sport in the next years to come. We remain optimistic for this to happen,” Banzuela said. For archery to be recognized as a regular sport, Banzuela said it has to sustain the participation of at least four schools – something that he foresee can be achieved with consistent marketing and promotional events. Banzuela said the country’s chances of making it big in the Olympics are with, with Filipino athletes’ top standing in international events. <br><br>Silliman University has produced a number of internationally-renowned archers, among them Olympians Rowel Merto, Lisa Ygnalaga, Jennifer Chan, and Mark Javier, who was the lone Filipino in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.  The series of demo games in archery had Silliman taking the lead in all three categories (30meter, 50 meter and Olympic round) in both men and women’s divisions. (Klein Emperado) <br><br><br><br>",

   "body": "The University Games (UniGames) started in 1996 in Bacolod with a single event -- volleyball.  Afterall, founder Roger Banzuela used to be president of the Philippine Amateur Volleyball Association.  The UniGames eventually grew in terms of events, schools, and number of participants. {{more}}<BR><BR>This year’s  staging, backed by the Philippine Sports Commission and hosted by Silliman University and  the provincial government of Negros Oriental and the City of Dumaguete, attracted close to 3,000 athletes  from 47 schools from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, who competed in 13 regular events plus a “demo sport” in archery. <BR><BR>The way it has been turning out, the UniGames has become a mix of everything aside from being an athletic meet: a reunion of former national athletes and coaches, same for former teammates, and perhaps a real semestral break for athletes who compete with the same dedication that they show in their regular leagues back home. <BR><BR>Fact is for Metro Manila schools, no more Team Bs have been fielded these past years.  The credibility and popularity of the UniGames has improved so much that the schools have been sending their teams that usually compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCCA) or in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), providing a much-anticipated playing opportunity for provincial teams.  <BR><BR>The story goes that there was one provincial school which beat Team B of De La Salle-Taft in basketball.  But so what if it was only Team B? The winning school had a giant streamer made, proclaiming to the world  that it beat La Salle, for a year; the streamer was hanging there for the next year, and when a typhoon ripped it apart, the school even replaced it. <BR><BR>The UniGames has also become a showcase of pitting Metro Manila schools against those scattered throughout the rest of the Philippines.  In the 2009 UniGames edition held in Iloilo City, Metro Manila schools dominated the league, winning 20 of the 24 events; Visayas took three titles, including football, the big sport in this part of the world; and La Salle Dasmarinas went home with one. <BR><BR>This year, the fact that the UniGames happened in the heels of the annual Buglasan Festival of Festivals in the province of Negros Oriental added to the spectacle and rich experience for the visiting athletes and guests. <BR><BR>“The UniGames gives me a chance to provide a playing opportunity for my bench players to prepare them for future competitions,” said Ateneo coach Norman Black, who has been bringing his Blue Eagles regularly to the UniGames.  Black, who’s going for his third straight UniGames championship in basketball, also denied he personally goes to the UniGames to scout for and recruit players.  <BR><BR>Other basketball personalities who flew in to Dumaguete were coach Junel Baculi for National University, Falcons coach Leo Austria for Adamson University, coach Bert Flores for Far Eastern University, PBA’s Eric Altamirano who came to watch his son play for Ateneo, and former PBA Shell trainer Hercules Callanta for Lyceum of the Philippines University, who also gave a talk during the UniGames Sports Science  Seminar held two days before the formal opening of the Games. Car racer Vip Isada was also in Dumaguete with the UP Diliman volleyball teams. <BR><BR>Indeed, the UniGames has become a mix of everything and of everyone. (Lito Cinco) <BR><BR>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>icasocot@gmail.com <br> <br><br>As I write this, it is a late Tuesday in the waning days of October, and I am hating the chatter of this couple on a study date in this crowded café. They are in the next table behind me, and try as I might, I become an unwilling eavesdropper into their conversation—something the music piped right into my ears with my earphones cannot even remedy. Sigur Ros, James Morrison, the Hans Zimmer soundtrack from <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Inception</span> are powerless. The girl is Asian and seems inappropriately giggly; the guy is blonde and strikes a macho pose in his probing questions and corny jokes. The guy says something bland or inane, and the girl giggles and provides chatty fodder for their conversation’s twists and turns, including strange detours into the Oedipus Complex and living in Canada. They have gone on with this getting-to-know-you game for a while now, and I am on my second cup of café latte. I am hungry and loaded with caffeine, and I cannot write the story I have sworn to finish today, or else. I can feel a headache coming. It is 7.27 in the evening in The Java House along East Washington Street, a football pigskin’s throw from the pedestrian mall in the center of town. I think about the grocery I have to buy in Bread Garden Market after I finish this cup of coffee. The café’s wifi is down, and I miss the occasional Facebook breaks I take from my writing, where the “occasional” is considerably longer than the actual work at hand. The couple behind me now talks about the “rules” of friending people in Facebook, and I roll my eyes. I think hazily about procrastination, and decide to do something about this habit later. I think about missing gym for four days now. I think about the stories and articles I have yet to finish. I think about the books I have to read, and the films I have to screen. I think about my remaining days in America. I think about time slipping fast.<br><br>I think about time a lot these days.<br><br>I think about the past weekend in Chicago, and think about how I had spent Monday in a pursuit of cocooning rest. This meant movies and books and general avoidance of the outside world. Outside, Iowa City is getting cold. The cold snap of autumn has gone towards its most extreme. The TV news tells me there is a storm brewing all over the Midwest. There are tornado warnings for Mississippi and Wisconsin. I find myself dressing in a flannel shirt and a sweatshirt and a coat and a pair of canvas skate shoes. I look at myself in the mirror and think about how, with such a simple sartorial act, I have gone suddenly \"native.\"<br><br>This is not a usual day for me here in Iowa City. Often, each day is sunny and free of irritating moments—when it does become chilly, the beauty of trees turning gold in the fall offsets it. This is why I am recounting all this in detail, because it is unusual. My stay here has been beautiful, and all that is coming to an end soon, in a few weeks. I think about time a lot these days. And how it slips away so fast.<br><br>Here’s what a normal day here is for me. There’s waking up late in the morning, then gym at the nearby Fitness First, then lunch at A Taste of China along Linn Street (or some other place when rice does not do it for you anymore), then coffee-aided writing at The Java House or T-Spoon, then the library till midnight, then home. On weekends, there’s music at The Mill or beer at Fox Head or Donnelly’s. The bibliophiles among us, who are most of us, go to Prairie Lights or The Haunted Bookstore or Murphy-Brookfield for a relief of their book addiction. We are kept busy some days attending to lectures and readings and film screenings and parties and excursions, most of which are optional. We are told that our primary duty in this writing residency is to write. And so we do. I sleep late at night to catch up on work and reading, aided for the most part by Red Bull in cans, something that is treated almost like water here. I have learned to hate the television a month before; the remote control is hidden behind the set, in an attempt to make turning the TV on a little harder, a mile shy of temptation.<br><br>In the rooms around mine in The Iowa House Hotel where we are billeted, the writers are battling with words and turns of phrases—and so must I. It is the best kind of writerly pressure. Compatriot Edgar Calabia Samar is finishing the introduction to his dissertation, an anti-detective novel in Filipino. Hong Kong’s Lai Chu Hon is finished with her novella about girls jumping off buildings, and Russia’s Alan Cherchesov is finished with his novel as well. Indonesia’s bestselling author Andrea Hirata began his fifth novel in the beginning of the residency, and is now finished with it. Singapore’s Thiam Chin O has finished four chapters of his first novel about two couples in an unnamed Asian island after the tsunami. Egypt’s Ghada Abdel Aal is biding her time, having decided not to write at all (except her columns back home!), occupied as she is with pressing interviews and readings and classroom visits. She has so far appeared in The Washington <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Post</span>, which has done a feature on her as the author of a widely popular television show back in Cairo based on her book <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I Want to Get Married!</span> She tells me that as a Muslim woman, “sometimes I am treated here more as a symbol than as a person.” Argentina’s lovely (and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">uncomplicated</span>! she would love that word) Pola Oloixarac, one of Granta’s choices for best young Spanish novelists, makes the conference circuit in Spanish language literature from Boston to Barcelona. India’s Chandrahas Choudhury gives readings of his first novel everywhere. Others are finishing screenplays and poetry collections. We—all 38 of us from far-flung places in the world—are all busy writing, when we are not partying or doing readings or visiting places or meeting authors like James Tate, Samantha Chang, Marilynne Robinson, Mona Simpson, Bo Caldwell, Yiyun Li, Jane Smiley, Xu Xi, among others. We get to travel, too, to get the breadth of America, which is part of the pursuits of this program. So far, there has been San Francisco for me (and Cody in Wyoming, Portland, and New Orleans for the others), as well as Chicago, and soon Washington, D.C. and New York. In those places, the touristy stuff prevail: in Chicago, there’re the architectural boat tour, the art overload in the Institute of Art, the plays in the theater district, the dancing in Boystown, the restaurant-hopping in Wicker Park, the skyline from Museum Campus, the view of the world from atop Willis Tower, the shopping along Michigan Avenue, among others; in San Francisco, there’re Alcatraz and Fisherman’s Wharf and the Golden Gate Bridge, the winding descent of Lombard Street, the bohemian air of Haight-Ashbury and The Mission, the nightlife in the Castro and Valencia Drive; in Washington, D.C. and New York, there will be more of the same. The goal is immersion in the culture, as well as to write. I came here to write my second novel, but somehow ended up writing short stories instead. I am almost halfway finished with that new collection <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Where You Are is Not Here</span>, all set in places not in the Philippines. When IWP writers greet each other in the morning, our hellos are often followed by this phrase: “How’s your word count?”<br><br>You can say that Iowa City is a writer’s dream. When Teng Mangansakan III, who was a fellow two years ago, told me earlier that this experience would be life-altering, I didn’t know if I could believe him, but now I know for sure. Remember those fantasies you keep about spending your days not preoccupied with such trifling concerns like a day job, spending only time chasing words and inspiration? The residency in the International Writing Program is the fulfillment of that fantasy—but after its expiration date comes the thought about having to go back to the ordinary world, where you have to take in again all those nagging everyday concerns, which compete with the fact of being a writer. Alas.<br><br>But nevertheless. To get a taste of this life, to be given this opportunity, that is enough.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><a href=\"mailto:docmequi@yahoo.com \">docmequi@yahoo.com </a><br><br>I have been on the campaign trail for over 20 years advocating for the banning of boxing—a formidable challenge in a country with a history of nurturing boxing champions—and sports leaders obsessed with winning our first Olympic gold medal. I realize that my personal campaign against boxing which brought me to meet even the late Jaime Cardinal Sin in an attempt to gain his support, is akin to Don Quixote jostling with the windmills. But I never gave up. I am still looking for people who passionately share this fight to protect our youth and children from the potential health risks that boxing poses. <br><br>And, happily, in the PhilStar’s issue of Nov 4, 2010, sports columnists and former Chairman of the Philippine Sports Commission, wrote about the “UP College of Medicine Department of Neurosciences organizing an international symposium on ‘Boxing and the Brain: Evaluation and Management of Head and Neck Injuries’ to be held on Dec. 3-4 at the Diamond Hotel.  The proceeds from the program will be used to establish the first Asian Brain Bank at the UP College of Medicine and the Philippine General Hospital. The symposium is the first of its kind in the Philippines and Asia.” <br><br>Juico further writes: “I’m certain that the position taken by groups like the British Medical Association will surface in the symposium. The BMA position is very simple: since the early 1980’s, the organization has called for a total ban on amateur and professional boxing in the United Kingdom which has produced the likes of heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, Olympic silver medalist Amir Khan (light welterweight), Ricky Hatton (light welterweight, welterweight), Jimmy Wilde (flyweight), Ken Buchanan (lightweight) and Randy Turpin (middleweight)…In article called ‘Boxing – The BMA’s Position’, the organization said that as a first step, there should be a ban on children below the age of consent from boxing.” <br><br>The BMA opposition to boxing is based on medical evidence showing risks to both acute injury and chronic brain damage sustained cumulatively during a boxer’s boxing career and it could take several years before ex-boxers will manifest any sign of suffering from brain damage. <br><br>“In 1993, the BMA’s report, “The Boxing Debate”, found no evidence to suggest that boxing was any safer in the 1990’s than it was when the BMA began its campaign in the 1980’s. In a new report, “Boxing, an Update from the Board of Science” (Sept. 2007), the BMA extends its call for a complete ban on amateur and professional boxing to include mixed martial arts competitions.<br><br>The BMA emphasizes that in 1991, 11 national medical associations added their voice to the opposition to boxing, and expressed their concerns regarding the dangers of boxing believing that ultimately it should cease to exist. The medical associations stated that modern medical technology demonstrates beyond doubt that chronic brain damage is caused by the recurrent blows to the head experienced by all boxers, amateur and professional alike. ‘As long as it is legal to hit an opponent above the neck, there are no safety precautions which can be taken to prevent this damage’”, Juico said. <br><br>As early as 1986, the Vatican L’Osservatore Romano, newspaper of the Holy See, proclaimed that boxing is an “immoral sport,” because the object of the protagonists is to inflict corporal damage on the opponent. This view is reiterated in 2005 by the World Medical Association when the members stated that:  “Boxing is a dangerous sport. Unlike most other sports, its basic intent is to produce bodily harm in the opponent. Boxing can result in death and produce an alarming incidence of chronic brain injury. For this reason, the WMA recommends that boxing be banned.” <br><br>Juico also wrote that “the American Association of Neurological Surgeons report that 90 percent of boxers sustain a brain injury. Boxing may account for fewer deaths than some other sports but the number of boxers suffering brain damage are believed to be much higher than recorded.” <br><br>In at least three instances in the past, I have written about my opposition to boxing— especially boxing for children being tolerated by the DepEd in the Palarong Pambansa and Filipino women being fielded in international boxing competition. The American Medical Association claims that “children boxing is plain and simple a form of child abuse” and that anyone tolerating this is guilty of the crime of child abuse. Cuba, a country noted for its boxing program that had produced dozens of Olympic champions will not compete in the London 2012 Olympics, with Jose Barrientos, head of Cuba’s sports federation saying: “We have no intention of participating for the moment in any international competition as we consider this discipline is inappropriate for women.” Likewise, Cuba’s head boxing coach Pedro Roque said that “Cuban women are made for beauty and not to take blows around the head”. <br><br>I know that there are many people in our University Town who strongly support boxing. A leading university includes boxing in its PE curriculum. I encourage those who are involved in the promotion of boxing in our locality—medical doctors, managers, boxers and even the PE teachers who are involved in the boxing events of the Palarong Pambansa to attend the symposium.

   "body": "h.cecilia7@gmail.com <BR><BR>The idea of more intensively promoting tourism invariably comes up whenever economic development strategies for the province are discussed, and it was no different at a forum recently held by the Buglas Development Foundation. <BR><BR>The acronym ACT was proposed, to stand for agricultural modernization, communications access and tourism development.  On tourism, the same message is always put forward: if Thailand can make tourism a major pillar of their economy, or closer to home, if Bohol’s tourism has taken off, then so should it be possible in this province. <BR><BR>Having been very frequently in Thailand for work, and also taken in the sights, I always find the comparison less than realistic. Thailand simply has more to offer by way of cultural and architectural sights, its temples and palaces, exquisite handicrafts and products, the gustatory thrills, along with the natural attractions of beaches, islands or mountain cities and sights, and not to forget botanical or royal gardens.  A comparison with Bohol makes more sense although it has better beaches in Panglao Island, the attraction of the curious natural formation of the “chocolate hills”, and some reasonably organized tourism activities.  The advantages that this province has in common with Bohol have mostly to do with dive sites and a number of good resorts. <BR><BR>So if, as in the ACT formula, tourism is to be a major economic motor, what sort of tourism should this province be aiming for, and who puts together a coherent plan, presumably the Provincial Tourism Council? Over the years, the sites and possibilities for tourism activities have remained the same few options. As someone who frequently has non-diver visitors from outside the province, it would be nice to have something more to do with them than a habal-habal ride to Caseroro Falls if they’re up to it, lunch at a beach resort in Dauin, and dinner along the boulevard.  <BR><BR>Going to Balinsasayaw or Balanan lakes isn’t just about being there, hiking would be a good activity if trails were well planned which they weren’t the last times I was there.  And by the way, Tourism Council, it is a shameful sight to drive along the coastal roads and to see every roadside tree plastered with advertising posters.  How we dirty up nature and spoil what should be natural beauty is immediately apparent particularly to foreign visitors, even if the locals are inured to this visual pollution.  <BR><BR>Fiesta tourism may appeal to some, but too often it’s a mess and filled with pathetic attempts at festivity and retrograde “crownings” of fiesta “kings and queens.” I certainly never want to see more street dancing in my life and neither did a visiting Canadian friend recently who had just been at the Bacolod Mascara, carrying away impressions of jostling crowds, intolerable noise and disorder. <BR><BR>Dumaguete City itself has little to offer the visitor by way of sights or activities.  It should take a cue from Singapore or Kuala Lumpur where public gardens are attractions, Singapore’s wonderful botanical garden, and KL’s Orchid garden and Gumamela /Hibiscus garden.  Just think how lovely it would be, for the local population and the visitor,  to have a such a spot in the city to enjoy the beauty and peace of plants,  to make up for the creeping urban blight that for some, goes by the name of development.  What is it in our culture, in our political leaders, different from some of our neighbors in the region,  that does not value the healthy connection to nature?  A look at Quezon or Freedom parks shows how little care there is for them as parks, instead they are merely designed and used as venues for any and all kinds of activities. A flower garden in the city is possible and would be valuable, for the people of Dumaguete and as a tourism attraction.  <BR><BR>In all this, it’s important to be aware of a caveat from American economists and long- time observers and analysts of the Philippine political economy, Dr. Robin Broad and John Cavanagh.  In a recent article, they warned that the government’s reliance on four top sources of foreign exchange that depend on an unstable global economy exposes the country to risk, namely: export of electronics, remittances of OFWs, call center earnings, and tourism.  They identify this last as a particularly fickle sector because many things can happen to keep foreign tourists away. Their advice: to work for the development of local production (particularly in agriculture) for local consumption.  Tourism can be for local consumption too; developing tourism attractions in Dumaguete City and other sites in the province should bring in more visitors from other parts of the country.<BR><BR><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><BR><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "<BR>juanlmercado@gmail.com <BR><BR><BR>LAS  VEGAS,  NEVADA---  Can you imagine the chaos  that’d   erupt if faucets  dried up in the hundreds of  bars and  gambling casinos  that line  “The Strip”. This  6.8 kilometer stretch  crams in  19 of the world’s largest hotels with 67,000 rooms. They jostle  for headlines, blotting out Las Vegas divorce mills and suicides. <BR><BR>Less noticed  is  the city’s slow climb out from the last recession. . Unemployment crested at  14.7 percent,  highest in the U.S., New York Times notes (It was 3.8 percent  a decade ago) Construction is the other economic pillar of  Nevada. That, too  hasn’t recovered. <BR><BR>City leaders wager that gambling revenues will rise  as the recession peters out. They look over their shoulders, meanwhile, at  Macau. The former Portuguese colony overtook Las Vegas as the world’s No. 1 gambling market in 2006. <BR><BR>Macau hasn’t relinquished that lead since. In Macau casinos “there is no such thing as a free drink”  either. <BR><BR>Las Vegans  also  apply that axiom  to a  water  crunch  Nine out of every 10 liters that  they  use to  gargle, wash in or drink,  is pumped from the Colorado River.—blistered  by a severe drought last year. That’s  an “all-bets-on-one- throw” game.<BR> <BR>This eerily resembles Metro Cebu. Over 95 percent of water is  siphoned from narrow limestone aquifers. That’s double what they can recharge. The “overdraft” sent water levels plummeting. Sea water contaminates irreversibly these underground reservoirs. <BR><BR>Is this a  replay of how Los Angeles siphoned water away from  Owens Valley in 1913? That turned a 100-square-mile lake into a desert.. Today, it lofts up clouds of cadmium and iron. Groundwater pumping lowered  water table in parts of Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas by more than 100 ft., the U.S. Geological Survey warns. <BR><BR>As in  major Philippine cities, population in Las Vegas has soared. The headcount here doubled  since 1990. That surge comes  mostly from migrants. Poker chips and slot jackpots are magnets. <BR><BR>In contrast, high birth rates declined slowly in Metro Manila, Iloilo or Davao. These  interlocked with high numbers of those who swapped rural poverty for urban slum penury. <BR><BR>For both cities, to do nothing is a prescription for disaster. Southern Nevada Water Authority, therefore, proposed to build a 285-mile pipeline to haul groundwater from six valleys in eastern Nevada. That’d stave off dry taps in casinos and homes. <BR><BR>“The debate over a plan to pump water out of the Nevada desert could be the next battle in the war over the West’s most vital natural resource,” writes Alex Hutchinson. No similar debate has taken place in the Philippines ---  so far. <BR><BR>While mayor of Cebu, now-Rep Tomas Osmena chose to do precisely nothing. He derailed proposals to  pipe in surface water from outlying towns. Thus, Cebu today is saddled with the country’s most  critical emerging  water crisis.”<BR> <BR>“There is no such thing as a free drink.” Water will emerge as a  major development issue sooner rather than later, stressed 2,500  experts at the 20th World Water Week in Stockholm late last year. “Sanitation and water are not just targets or sectors. They are the fundamental basis for life and indispensable to sustainable development”, their statement said. <BR> <BR>Governments  and UN”s High Level Plenary Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals must pay more attention to water and sanitation. <BR><BR>UN Environment Programme suggests: Look at how countries vary in their use of a common resource --- rainwater.<BR> <BR>Almost 86 percent  of Singapore’s high-rise buildings collect rainwater. Roof water whittled down water bills for Singaporeans from S$1.17 per cubic meter down to S$0.96. <BR><BR>At Manila  International Airport, rainwater sloshes down to the sea. In contrast, Chiangi Airport in Singapore impounds rainfall, from runways and  green areas, into two reservoirs. Collected  treated water accounts for 28 percent to 33 percent of total supplies at  the airport. Savings: $ 390,000 yearly. <BR><BR>In Tokyo, the 8,400 square meters rooftop of Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo-wrestling Arena funnels rainwater into underground storage tanks. The example is catching on.<BR> <BR>Thailand offers loans and technical help to build 1,000 to 3,000-liter jars. A family of six is assured sufficient rainwater during the dry season.<BR> <BR>In Bangladesh, rainwater provides drinking water, specially in areas where arsenic contaminates wells. Over 1,000 rainwater harvesting systems have been installed. <BR><BR>Indonesia requires that all buildings install an infiltration well. The rule  applies to Yogyakarta, West  and Central Java.  This could tamp the 53 percent water deficit down to 37 percent. <BR><BR>In Capiz here,, Canadian International Development Research Centre provided $200 loans, payable in three years, to build 500 rainwater storage tanks. Each tank is linked to an income-generating activity, like rearing pigs. This innovative mechanism whittled down  water subsidies. <BR><BR>Whatever happened to the rainwater conservation project by 278 households in Barangay Villahermosa in Camotes Island? Local government and townspeople shared the cost of this pioneering program. Magsaysay awardee Antonio Opposa led Global Legal Action on Climate Change in asking the Supreme Court: issue a writ of mandamus that’d compel local governments to implement the Rainwater Collector and Springs Development Law. <BR><BR>Enacted in 1989, RA 6716 directed that 100,000 rainwater collectors were to be completed in three years. Only four were actually built. <BR><BR>By  decisive action, PNoy’s administration can resurrect this  program from mummified law. That would impact  he lives  of  ordinary Filipinos. After all, “there is no such thing as a free drink.” <BR><BR><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><BR><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

He announced that he got positive response to his invitation for investments. <BR><BR>Let us recall that Vietnam was devastated by war, in the past from the 1960’s to the middle of the 1970’s. Now, it is progressive, with higher economic growth index than the Philippines. In fact, the Philippines import rice from Vietnam. The economic growth in Vietnam happened while the Philippines got mired in divisive politics, corruption both in the private and public sector, flight of economic capital, and utter lack of focus on the economic goals for the common good. <BR><BR>Back in the 1960’s, the Philippines was in the upper five economies in Asia, basking on the so-called free market system. Bolstered by its post-war economic ties, mainly with the United States. The reparations from Japan and reconstruction funding from the World Bank, were flowing into government coffers, along with a strong sense of nationhood, surviving, thriving, after emerging victorious in the Second World War. Believe it or not, the exchange rate was one (1) dollar is to two (2) pesos. Our economy was that strong. This was the time when the Philippines stood tall economically among its ASEAN neighbors, and became one of its founding members. <BR><BR>Today ASEAN economies are thriving amidst the global financial crisis. Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia,  Taiwan and the Republic of South Korea are very progressive economies, with their governments adopting authoritarian policies in keeping peace and order and building infrastructure projects. China which is communist, has emerged as a the second strongest economy in the world, with the market oriented reforms introduced by Deng Xiao Peng in the 1980’s. Deng recognized the practicability of the profit motive and the spirit of enterprise, with government support in the form of infrastructure, opening bilateral trade relations to other countries and investing abroad with loans granted to countries in Africa, among others. <BR><BR>In contrast, the Philippines adopted authoritarian policies during the Martial Law years, 1972-1986, which was not actually dismantled, in the subsequent years. The net result is the decline in economic growth, capital flight, the rise of the privileged oligarchy, and an increase in the number of Filipinos living below the poverty line. The election of P-Noy into office, is an affirmation of the aspirations of the Filipino people for a better, more responsive, morally upright government, in order to reverse the slide towards   economic stagnation/decline. <BR><BR>The Philippines was a thriving economically progressive democratic country in the 1960’s before Martial Law, there is no reason why it cannot compete and achieve its goals for development. P-Noy has just rolled out his Medium Term Development goals until 2016.   <BR><BR>Pope John Paul II in his speech in Bacolod City on February 20, 1981, said: <BR><BR>“Injustice reigns when within the same society some groups hold most of the wealth and power while large strata of the population cannot decently provide for the livelihood of their families even through back breaking labor in the factories and in the fields. Injustice reigns when the laws of economic growth and even greater profit determine social relations, living in poverty and destitution those who have only the work of their hands to offer.  Being aware of such situations, the Church will not hesitate to take up the cause of the poor and to become the voice of those who are not listened to when they speak up, not to demand charity but to ask for justice.” <BR><BR>Justice will only be achieved if majority of the people have sources of livelihood to adequately provide for their families. <BR><BR>",

We had the Buglasan, Unigames, CVRAA, and now, Dumaguetenos are preparing for the Nov. 24 Charter Day and Fiesta celebration. And all these are happening just one month before December! <br><br>But before we get carried away by the so many activities that are expected to unfold, or that are currently unfolding, there’s a week that we have to mark with great importance and concern. Nov. 19-24 is Climate Change Week. <br><br>Now you may ask, what’s so important about Climate Change? One popular media personality from Manila was chastised by environmentalists while in Dumaguete after she commented after a Climate Change presentation (she was the next speaker) that the Climate Change talk was like a sleeping pill for her audience. <br><br>Well, Climate Change may be a sleeping pill for those who are not interested in this topic. But the tragedy is that there’s no escaping it. We are all feeling the effects of Climate Change one way or the other. <br><br>Stronger rain, extreme weather, higher temperature, sea level rise. These are among the effects of Climate Change that directly impact all of us as residents of Negros Oriental. Higher temperature will mean lesser rainfall, longer rains due to La Nina could bring in the dreaded dengue-carrying mosquito. Sea level rise may take much longer than our lifetimes, but it does make us ponder what kind of life our grandchildren could have if they someday would have to squeeze themselves into the few mountains that we have. <br><br>There are two ways of fighting Climate Change. One is through mitigation. This means cutting down on harmful practices that speed up Climate Change. These are activities like burning garbage, using freon, unnecessary use of fossil fuels, and deforestation. <br><br>The other way of fighting Climate Change is through adaptation. If we live in hazardous areas, we must take steps to ensure that our homes are going to withstand the force of a typhoon or flood. We have to plant more trees to produce more oxygen and act as a carbon sink for the CO<sub>2</sub> that we collectively contribute to our environment. <br><br>Other adaptation measures are saving on water by collecting precious rainwater and using it to water our plants or to flush our toilets. You might also want to cool your house by repainting your roof white, instead of the dark colors which only attract heat. <br><br>The important lesson here is that all of us have a solution to Climate Change in our hands. Little things could go a long way towards making that shift for the environment, and taking action now could spell survival. <br><br><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Dumaguete-MetroPost/125173630872998?ref=ts\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><font style=\"color: #0010ff;\" size=\"2\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dumaguete MetroPost is now on</span> Facebook.

Jesus did not answer her at all (v.23).  The disciples took advantage of this silence to urge Jesus to drive the woman away.  That would have been an understandable reaction.  The woman was a Canaanite. As far as the Jews were concerned, she was second-class pagan, undeserving and unworthy of the Lord’s time and attention.  <br><br>The second response of Jesus was so shocking and seemingly very inappropriate, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.”</span>  He was obviously insinuating that since she was a Canaanite and not a Jew, Jesus had nothing to do with her.  But instead of turning away or taking offense, she humbled herself further and said, “Lord, help me.”  <br><br>The third response of Jesus was simply so outrageous, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to their dogs.”</span>  In this third response, Jesus was referring to the Canaanites as “dogs” unworthy to partake even the crumbs of the Jews. At this point, the woman, instead of giving up, showed greater perseverance, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Yes, Lord.  But even the dogs eat crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”</span>  At this moment, Jesus knew that this mother was not going to take a “no” for an answer. To this reply Jesus could only say, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Woman you have great faith. Your request is granted.”</span>  Her daughter was healed that very hour. <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Persistence </span><br></div><br><br>        Like the Canaanite woman, there are times when our needs are seemingly met with nothing but silence. Remember that gospel account where the disciples were caught in a big storm and Jesus was there in the boat with them sleeping? His disciples cried out in frustration, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Jesus, don’t you care that we drown?” </span><br><br>The disciples just couldn’t understand how Jesus could afford to sleep or be silent in such a situation. All they concluded was that he simply didn’t care. But you see, this is what persistence is all about, persistence in knowing and believing that even when nothing seems to be happening, God is certainly at work.  <br><br>Imagine if the Canaanite woman walked away form Jesus and never persisted in her asking? She would have missed out on a miracle. This happens to many of us. We miss out on God’s blessings because we walk away too soon. One of my best friends in college is now based in Glendale, California.  She narrated that when a Jollibee store opened in their area, she and her husband had to cue for over 2 hours just to have a taste of Chickenjoy! Now that’s persistence! In a world where people want instant gratification and quick fixes, it is important that we stop and reflect the value and power of persistence. <br> <br>Being persistent and being presumptuous are two different things, however. Genuine persistence is not just insisting on what we want. True persistence is grounded on one’s relationship with Christ that is nurtured in faith. It is standing firm in our conviction that the moment we hit rock bottom and when all else fails, all things are still always possible with the Lord. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Woman you have great faith. Your request is granted.”  </span><br>  <br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Peace</span> <br></div><br><br>        The biblical definition of the word peace is “well-being” and “security.” Peace is never about the absence of conflict. True peace is having a full grasp of the presence of God. Our gospel account today teaches us that every time we cry to God for help, we are opening the door for God’s presence and God’s participation in our specific circumstances. It is when we turn to God that we receive and experience peace. Unfortunately, we are living in a world that is so obsessed with peace, but so ignorant of its real meaning. Many so-called peacemakers have risen in our times and yet, nations continue to live in great fear and insecurity. Jesus Christ came to offer a different kind of peace, a peace that the world cannot understand, as the song goes. Sadly, during his earthly ministry, many rejected his peace. But for the Canaanite woman and those who humbled themselves and called upon the Lord by faith, the results were great wonders and mighty miracles.  <br><br>Friends, there are times in our lives when we feel that our prayers are falling on deaf ears and we feel that we are so alienated from God. We learn today from the Canaanite woman that it is in our times of need and in our moments of vulnerability that we are able witness the glory of God in our lives. In faith, let us therefore be confident that even when nothing seems to be happening, the Lord hears our every cry for help. Let us persist. Let us learn to hold on. Let us not give up too soon.  God’s help will surely come---a lot sooner than we have imagined. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Peace to us all in Christ’s Name! Amen!</span> <br><br><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><br><br><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

I have been feeling rather down today -- perhaps I am just tired from the previous night's frenzied partying -- that not even a splendid hay ride in a beautiful Iowan farmhouse can mitigate it, and everything to me now seems to run with forbidding shadows. Some things are even hateful in varying degrees. The full capacity of this cafe, for example, when on ordinary days I delighted in seeing the constant traffic of interesting faces. And the fact that it's cold outside. There's also my use of the word \"mitigate,\" which I find utterly pretentious, and I hate it. So is my use of the word \"utterly.\" It seems that in this down time, I have learned how to perfectly cannibalize myself with little irritations.<br><br>I use a lot of excuses, don't I.<br><br>The real reason is the fact that there is something inevitable that stares me at me now: <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">going home</span>. How do you go home after Iowa? After the International Writing Program? But I am, all of us are. We are leaving in barely three weeks, and I don't think I'm ready to go back to my old life just yet. And yet, there are already missives from and of home that are like reminders of this inevitability: emails from family and friends, announcements from work, and the constant moans by O Thiam Chin <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">every single day</span> that this is his \"last Friday in Iowa City,\" his \"last Saturday in Iowa City,\" his \"last Sunday in Iowa City.\" I keep mum, always in that posture of denial, but in my head I tell him: \"I am counting out my last days, too, and I am sad.\"<br><br>Amilcar is already gone So is Najwan. You can see how sad most of us are. We try to hide this <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">silly sentimentality</span>, of course, with smiles and small talk and good cheer and drunken parties -- and sometimes, for some of our men here in the IWP, with a slinky black dress or women's lingerie for a Halloween night's excuse to let our hair down. Last night, at the ghoulish gathering at the Merinos', you could feel that pull for camaraderie among many of the writers in the IWP. There was an acknowledgment in the air that we were indeed counting out our days, that we were saying our drawn out goodbyes in whatever form we want them to take, that we were probably not going to see each other again but that we were glad that, for more than two months, we were blessed with their friendships, their capacity for taking us into their lives and making us part of them.<br><br>I will miss Ghada's smile, for example, and her constant protests about her cheerfulness. I will miss Pola's wildfire presence, the way she comes into every room and commands everybody's attention. I will miss Touche's playful gravity, and his conviction that he is always the most beautiful person in the room. I will miss Andrea's sudden bouts of laughter, and his mission to photograph himself in every single spot in the United States. I will miss Mr. Kim's quiet and calming presence -- and his totally terrifying Jigsaw Halloween mask. I will miss Edgar and the way he walks around with the security blanket that is his bag. I will miss Coco's quiet air, the way she talks to you like you are the only person in the room. I will miss Solvi's tallness -- and his wig and lingerie. I will miss Christopher's anecdotes, and the animated way he tells them. I will miss Chandrahas' impeccable sartorial sense and his capacity for elegantly working the room. I will miss Milosz's secret rock star wish and his electric guitar. I will miss being a visitor in Marjia's universe, and the way she can belt out every single song in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</span>. I will miss Laura's delightful accent, and her Gabriel. I will miss Turusbek's dancing, and his booming voice. I will miss Billy’s hand gestures when he talks passionately about something. I will miss Farhad's Cambridge accent, and the whiplashing wit he carries around with him like a weapon of mass distraction. I will miss Michael's giggles and his mission to see birds, of all sorts. I will miss Thiam Chin's hyper nature and his pickiness. I will miss Phoenix's gushing about film. I will miss H.M.'s swagger, and his allergy to the afternoon sun. (Or just the sun, period.) I will miss Amilcar's silence, the way his smile seems to just say everything. I will miss Hinemoana's quirkiness and deep soul and Halloweena costume. I will certainly <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">not</span> miss Ismail's milkshake addiction, and his obsessive fascination for Twinkies and bookstores. I will miss Albana's groundedness, the way she makes you feel at ease around her instantly. I will miss everything about David, that darling man.<br><br>There are the other writers, of course, all thirty-eight of us, each with a piece of memory of each other. Truth to tell, we only have these scant impressions of each other to work with, because two and a half months are never really enough to know anybody. But it is enough to say that given the little time that we've had, we gave the world to each other -- and made Iowa City in the beautiful autumn of 2010 an impossible place and time to forget in all our lifetimes.<br><br><br><a id=\"icnlnk\" href=\"http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998\"></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><br><br><br>        <div id=\"fbb\"><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><br><br>        <script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>vcstack@yahoo.com <BR> <BR>Halloween is a time for tricks as well as treats, so it is a good time to remember that perennial trickster, the snake oil salesman. <BR><BR>Snake oil is anything that promises to magically solve your problems but is in fact empty and useless.  It is promoted by skilled swindlers who prey on innocent, gullible or desperate people.  Their goal is to convince you that their snake oil (unlike everyone else’s) is the answer to your most difficult problems. <BR><BR>As human beings we tend to yearn for answers to things we don’t understand, and this is good, because it leads us to search for the truth. But it is a mistake to short-circuit that search by settling for easy answers. What is the point of our God-given ability to reason if we end up accepting any old thing, just because it promises to meet our emotional needs? <BR><BR>Snake oil salesman come in many forms, and vary widely in their degree of sophistication.  Satan was of course the original snake oil salesmen, always promising something you think you want, always delivering nothing but trouble, and charging a tremendously inflated price for it: your eternal soul. But his heirs are legion. <BR><BR>Some snake oil salesmen sell “services” such as forecasting your future using cards, tea leaves, your palm, or one of your possessions.  Others claim that they can contact the spirits of departed loved ones.  My favorite is when they claim that they can get rid of so-called “evil anomalies” in your house. <BR><BR>What about all those TV commercials for knives that never go dull, bras that make any pair of breasts look perfect, pills to make you lose weight, or lotion that will make your skin white.  (This obsession with becoming “white” is disturbing, but that’s a topic that deserves a column all to itself.) <BR><BR>As for the snake oil service providers, the ones that really irk me are the ones who claim they can actually heal peoples’ illnesses by performing a ceremony, complete with chants and various props to make it seem more convincing. I suppose some may benefit via a sort of placebo effect, but what price are they paying for such a feeble benefit, buying into (both financially and spiritually) a bunch of meaningless mumbo jumbo and cacamania.  (Yes, I made that word up. That’s how angry I am.) <BR><BR>They have even penetrated respectable professions such as medicine. Led by the expectation of profit, there are a few who will recommend unnecessary and even ill-advised procedures to their unsuspecting victims, I mean patients.  And who’s going to argue with a man with a white coat, a stethoscope and a smooth bedside manner? <BR><BR>A snake oil salesman is anyone whose agenda is to make a profit by exploiting those who are miserable, vulnerable or gullible.  P.T. Barnum said, “there’s a sucker born every minute.”  He may have underestimated.  But the fact that someone is a sucker (and at some points in our lives, we all meet the definition) is no excuse for taking advantage of them. Happy Halloween, and let’s be careful out there!<BR><BR><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><BR><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><BR><BR><BR>",

But heaven only goes that I was wrong. <br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kakakasal pa lang namin nun</span> when Jay received a unanimous text. “Meet me at the clinic.” I had a stinking feeling in my butt. I told him not to go. It might be in danger him. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pero sabi niya, ok lang daw</span> because life is what we make. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tumahimik lang ako. Sabi niya,</span> “Penny for your  talks?” But I didn’t know what to say. Beggars can’t be losers. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Isa pa,</span> worried <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">talaga ako na baka yung girl yun</span>. Jay said, “Can’t got your tongue?” I tried to smile at him. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kahit di ako nagsalita,</span> actions speak louder than works,<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> di ba?  </span><br><br>Be that as is may, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">umalis pa rin siya</span>. I was out of the loophole. After a few hours, I called him on his cellphone. But my calls fell on Jeff’s ears. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Lalo akong nag-</span>worry<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> kasi</span> I didn’t even know Jeff. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sabi na nga ba, di na dapat umalis si Jay.</span> That’s what I’m talking about it. <br><br>So I tried calling some friends who will help me find Jay. That’s what are friends are for <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">naman, di ba?</span> But I just faced a blank mall. I had to do  this alone. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nag-taxi na lang ako. Pero ang mahal na pala ng</span> plug down rate. <br><br>When I got to the clinic, the security was really buffed up. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Di  basta-basta makakapasok.</span> So I said, “I beg your cordon. I’m patient. It’s my favorite virtue <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">nga, e.” Nagduda yata yung isang guard. Hinawakan ako sa  arm</span>. The nerd! I shouted, “Don’t touch me not!” <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Buti na lang</span> the other  guards were nice and said, “Come on, let’s join us.” <br><br>When I went inside, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">parang</span> I’ve been there, done there. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nung walang nakatingin, nag-</span>explore <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ako. Nakarating ako sa</span> top floor and I had a bird’s IQ of the clinic. I could not explain it, but I was drawn to a room on the floor. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Siguro</span> Divine Intermission <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">na yun</span>.  <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Parang may narinig akong umuungol</span>. I was thorn. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Di ko alam kung aalis ba ako o papasukin ko</span>. It made me stick in the stomach to think that Jay and his ex-girlfriend were there. I tried to tell myself to slower my expectations. But to tell with it! I had to strike while the iron is not.  <br><br>I had to hear the truth from the corpse’s mouth. <br><br>I barraged in. O, my Gas! <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Si Jay naka</span>-strap <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sa</span> operating table, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">parang genie pig sa isang nakakatakot na</span> experiment. He was on the cutting edge. He was bleeding. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">At ang</span> doctor n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a nagpapahirap sa kanya, ang </span>ex-girlfriend <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">niya at ang bago nitong</span> boyfriend, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ang</span> nurse <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">na si </span>Walter. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Doon ko napatunayang</span> blood is  thicker  than Walter. <br><br>Guess watch? <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Di ko alam kung paano ko nagawa pero</span> I was able to search and rescue Jay. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Siguro adrenaline </span>brush<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> na yun</span>.   <br><br>Now, he’s recovering. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nag</span>-sorry <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">siya na hindi siya nakinig sa akin</span>. I know it’s a better pill to swallow your pride so it’s forgive and forget me not. All swell that end swell. I know we should kiss and put on makeup. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ang </span>ex-girlfriend<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> naman niya at si Walter, nakakulong na</span>. Detention is really better than cure. So the moral of the lesson is: if symptoms persist, insult your doctor.” <br><br>       ***** <br><br>Dear Cora, <br>We’ve been friends for a long time ago. We come from the same alma mother. Actually, our paths crossed one time on another. <br><br>But it’s only now that I gave him a second look. I realized that beauty is in the eyes. The pulpbits of my heart went fast, really fast. Cute <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pala siya</span>. <br><br>And then he came over with me. He said, “I hope you don’t mine. Can I get your number?” <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nag</span>-worry <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">ako</span>. What if he doesn’t give it back? He explained naman na it’s so we could keep intact <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">daw. Sabi ko</span>, connect me if i’m wrong but are you asking me ouch? <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nabigla siya. Sagot niya,</span> The Aba! <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Parang siya pa ang galit!</span>  I cried buckles of tears. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Na-</span>guilty<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> yata siya. Sabi niya</span>, Irregardless <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">daw</span> of his feelings, we’ll go ouch <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">na rin</span>. <br><br>Now, we’re so in love. Mute and epidemic<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> na ang</span> past. Thanks God we swallowed our fried. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kasi</span>, I’m 33 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">na</span>, and I’m running our time. <br><br>After two weeks, he plopped the question, “Will you marriage me?” I’m in a state of shocked. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kasi mantakin mo, </span>when it rains, it’s four!  So <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">siyempre</span>, I said yes. Love is a many splendor. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pero nung inaayos ko na ang aming kasal</span>, everything swell to pieces.  <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nag-di-</span>dinner<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> kami noon nang biglang sa harap ng aming </span>table<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">, may babaeng humirit ng</span>, “Well, well, well.

She accused me of steeling her boyfriend. Ats if! I don’t want to portrait the role of the other woman. Gosh, tell me to the marines!

   "body": "suakcrem@yahoo.com <BR><BR><BR>The Department of Science & Technology (DOST) is holding a forum on the status of Philippine biological resources this week. <BR><BR>Ideally, questions by anybody on the state of the natural resources at any point in time should be answered right away. But in the case of the Philippines, we lack databases on our biological resources from which answers can be extracted. I asked my friends in the Department of Environment & Natural Resources (DENR) for such databases but they told me there are none in the DENR at the present time. <BR><BR>The DENR cannot be blamed. If I know how government departments are functioning, such databases cannot be expected to exist. We seem to be a people who take things for granted. We assume that things will remain as they are for the years to come. We seem to be interested only in the present, not the future. That is why we have huge problems with the conservation of these resources. <BR><BR>I was in South Korea last month for a series of meetings on marine resources under a United Nations program on assessment of the marine environment. <BR><BR>In that meeting, I was impressed how the South Korean government keeps track of developments of their coastal and marine resources. They have databases for practically all of their marine resources, so they know the state of these resources at any point in time. <BR><BR>Even the number of species of migratory birds (150 species) visiting the shores of South Korea every year is in a database!  <BR><BR>Incidentally, this number happens to be about the number of migratory bird species recorded in the Philippines, if I remember it right. <BR><BR>There might be in some departments of the Philippine government databases on natural resources, but it seems there are none at the DENR. The previous government of the Philippines was right in putting out an Executive Order mandating the concerned agencies of government to develop databases on Philippine biodiversity. <BR><BR>The Commission on Higher Education has responded positively to this Order, and a program on research on Philippine biodiversity with the instruction to create databases is ongoing at the Commission, with the cooperation of selected institutions of higher learning. I am heading this program at this time.     <BR><BR>Research scientists can help in the creation of the databases, and several are now in use, such as FishBase and ReefBase databases. <BR><BR>These are, however, creations of foreign scientists mainly, and we need to expand the effort to include specific groups of Philippine biodiversity, which is, by the way, one of the most unique in the world. <BR><BR>Scientists as part of their academic responsibility write reviews of the state of knowledge in their fields of science. It is because of this that I am able to respond positively to the invitation to present the status of marine biological resources at the DOST forum this week. <BR><BR>I reiterate what I said regarding the need to create databases on our biological resources, both terrestrial and marine, and hope that the national government will respond favorably.<BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost home page)</span></a><br><BR>    </body><BR></html><BR><BR><BR><BR><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><BR><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

   "body": "On the docks in Dumaguete, under a lowering sky that seems about to pour down rain, these people are waiting to travel to unknown destinations. From the look of this crowd, and the boat they are waiting to board, they’re not going to New York, or Paris, or any other glamorous destination. No-- someplace nearby, another island: Cebu, Bohol, Mindanao. To work, to visit relatives, to attend a funeral.<BR><BR>They’re not happy about it.  The man in front with the deep frown, the one wearing sunglasses on this sunless day-- he seems to feel that nothing good will ever come his way, and he hates it. Those around him are restrained, passive, blank; but no more cheerful. It’s a gloomy scene on a gloomy day. <BR><BR>But that’s OK. Times like this are part of the drama of our lives, just as much as sunny days and smiles.  We live like waves, with crests and troughs, rising and falling through time; and all of us, in the end, break on the final shore. To pretend otherwise, to only see the sunny crests of time and call that “Life” paints a shallow picture of  the world, a picture that is ultimately silly and boring because it’s false.<BR><BR>The great works that we have made about ourselves in music, and art, in dance and drama, are just as often tragedies as comedies. And in the greatest comedies, the shadow of death can be felt beneath the laughter.<BR><BR>The great dramatic stories that have shaped our culture, the story of Adam and Eve, the story of  Christ – these are not happy stories; they would be pointless if they were. If Pilate had told Jesus “Don’t worry, be happy” and released with a slap on the back and a laugh, who would care about him now, or even remember him?  And of what value would his story be to us?<BR><BR>Smiling faces, sunny days, happy children at play; laughter in the afternoon with loved ones on the beach, or late at night with friends over a beer; these things are real and they happen, all the time. But that’s not all that happens. To picture only happy things is to try to produce a coin with only one side, stamped with a happy face. But a coin with only one side cannot exist.<BR><BR>This picture is about the other side of that coin.  <BR><BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport11-14.jpeg\"><BR><BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost home page)</span></a><br><BR>    </body><BR></html><BR><BR><BR><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><BR><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>",

(Tobacco, by the way, ranked  6th in the list. ) <br><br>We may not have known that alcohol can be a factor in 60 different diseases, but we certainly already knew about alcohol and road accidents, about family finances drained by addiction to drink, or jobs lost because of alcoholism.  <br><br>Multitudes of battered women and abused children witness to the links between alcohol and domestic violence. And your Monday morning radio news reports abound with stories of men having a good time at the week-end drinking with friends who then beat, stab, hack, or shoot each other. Those news bulletins may be followed by commercials for drinks! <br><br>It often seems that the culture of drinking here frequently involves drinking to get drunk, or drinking as a crutch to achieve an altered psychological state allowing a usually male drinker to  become assertive, boastful, loud, and louder at his videoke mike,  rude to women,  or on the other hand,  perhaps as temporary anaesthesia.    <br><br>Young men are particularly vulnerable to unsound drinking habits, but the unregulated and aggressive sale of alcoholic drinks apparently worries no one.  <br><br>Case in point: Disco dances are held very frequently at the Valencia gym (costing hundreds of people their sleep, but that is another matter.) When I happen to walk the dogs in the late afternoon,  the whole street in front of the gym is lined with vendors’ tables laden with nibblers and cigarettes and alcoholic drinks.  <br><br>No one seems to the vendors, if they have licenses to sell alcoholic drinks, and the Treasurer’s Office thinks this may fall under the allowed category of “domestic liquor” except that no one seems to know for sure what exactly that is.  <br><br>Then comes the question of the selling of alcoholic drinks to minors,  as minors and young people are the population who frequent those disco dances. <br><br>The police say they have no way of knowing who is selling what to whom. Actually, the real score is that nobody cares a whit. And why should they when drinking (and drunkenness) is just an accepted fact of life?! <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Lancet</span> report has drawn attention to the heavy health and social costs of that “fact of life.” It has sparked discussions on how to deal with the problem, and one of the responses is to limit availability. <br><br>The alcohol companies will howl, and like tobacco companies, will use all means fair and foul to ensure that profitable commerce continues unhampered. <br><br>In some countries it seems, getting strict on sales points, raising prices, limiting sale hours, or even declaring alcohol -free occasions are being tried. When the demonstrable harm is significant,  government needs to step in.  It is doing so with regard to tobacco.  <br><br>At the very least,  young people should be protected from adopting the  drinking culture of  the older generations. <br><br>Some things can be done with regard to  advertising, for example. While there’s no hold on national media, local radio stations could, if they wished (and had the ethical gumption) not do commercials for alcohol. <br><br>Billboards like the one on Real St. telling men to relax daily with beer could be disallowed, invoking executive prerogative. <br><br>Public events could be sponsored by non-alcohol companies. Enforcement of the prohibition on the sale of alcohol to minors needs rethinking to be effective.<br><br>None of this means that we can’t enjoy that beer or glass of wine anymore. It’s the excess, the macho drinking,  the irresponsible, problem-creating  drinking that’s the problem.  <br><br>Until medical research told us differently, we used to think of smoking as just a form of recreation. We think of drinking as recreation;  how are individuals, institutions, and government going to deal with this information about alcohol as a public health, public safety, youth development  and social welfare  issue? <br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost home page)</span></a><br><br><br><br>        <style>@font-face {<br><br>        font-family: \"Cambria\";<br><br>        }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: \"Times New Roman\"; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; }</style><br><br>        <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a id=\"icnlnk\"<br><br>        href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script<br><br>        type=\"text/javascript\">var<br><br>        icnid=\"158\";//101101</script></p><br><br>        <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><div id='fbb'><a<br><br>        href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a<br><br>        href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script<br><br>        src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script></p><br><br>        <p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><br><br>        <br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

There have also been other accidents before that.<BR><BR>The Buayahan spillway has been there for years. Several administrations have pledged to build a real bridge to replace it, but their commitments have remained empty promises to this day.<BR><BR>The Buayahan spillway is a symbol of government neglect for the welfare of its people.  There are no safeguards for vehicles; neither is there any responsible safety officer who could warn motorists ahead of time not to cross the spillway when the current is strong. <BR><BR>And when the Ocoy River does get flooded, people end up being marooned on the other side of the river, unless they take a circuitous alternative route that takes them first to the town of Sibulan.<BR><BR>These drownings from defective spillways should spark public outrage. We demand immediate action from government. <BR><BR>It baffles our minds as we think of the government’s wasteful spending by breaking up good asphalt roads only to cover them with cement.

I have had my share of people trying to change the world, but Hecky was one of those who simply reminded you that everyday heroes are ordinary people you meet everywhere. <br><br>That was our first meeting. It was brief and unfinished. We both had another engagements then so we agreed to meet again. <br><br>The next meeting was hurriedly set. He was in town for an overnight stay, and a mid-afternoon coffee break was a perfect opportunity. I asked Cobbie Palm and a fellow Silliman biker to join us. We talked about the project again, and the possibility of doing it retrofitted for the Silliman and the Dumaguete community.  It was a pleasant exchange of ideas which partly, only Hecky can brew. <br><br>As we were about to end, he politely showed a video clip in his mobile phone. It was about a bike he was riding. Or to put it accurately, it was about the frame of a bicycle he was riding. <br><br>He proudly introduced us the bamboo frame bicycle. We were all amazed by the new concept of putting the bamboo’s unquestioned versatility to good use, and the use of bamboo as bike frames was doubly far-reaching in promoting healthy lifestyle and environmental awareness. <br><br>Hecky was president of KawayanTech, a group composed of members of the UP Mountaineers.  They founded in July 2009, barely a month after our first meeting. He was also the author of KawayanTech Bamboo Bikes 2009 Business Plan that competed in the Business in Development (BiD) Challenge International Marketplace in the Netherlands this year. <br><br>Again, our meeting ended with an unfinished business.  He sent occasional emails and texts as I was trying to wrestle with the idea of putting up the replicate project. <br><br>We were actually supposed to meet again in October, and finalize our plans. As usual, we planned to meet over a cup of coffee. I had a tight schedule that day preparing for the Unigames in Dumaguete, but decided to accommodate a brief encounter with Hecky in Dumaguete. We agreed to meet late in the afternoon. A few minutes before the agreed time, Hecky called and, with his usual polite voice, apologized that he may not make it. We never got to meet that day. <br><br>That was the last time I heard Hecky’s polite voice, except for the usual links and tags on Facebook. <br><br>Coincidentally, I met his twin brother Alex while checking in for our flight to Dumaguete last Friday. I casually asked him how Hecky was doing, and mentioned about our failed meeting. I then planned to text or call him soon to continue discussion of his project. <br><br>Prior to Sunday, 7th of November, Ronald “Hecky” Villanueva had gone to sleep, and never woke up. The news was a shock to all of us who know him.  He was a passionate bike advocate, an avid mountaineer, an advocate of the environment, and a very good friend to many. <br><br>He was a natural hero and perhaps purposely, left us with an unfinished task to continue.<br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost home page)</span></a><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><br><br><a id=\"icnlnk\" href='http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998'></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><br><br><div id='fbb'><a href='http://coolbadge.org'>twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><br><br>",

   "body": "Negrenses attending a public hearing on applications for a Small-Town Lottery franchise in Negros Oriental scored the negative virtues of gambling at the Sangguniang Panlalawigan session hall Tuesday.{{more}}<BR><BR>The public hearing was called for by the provincial legislature after it received two applications for an STL franchise from a company called the Lucky Golden Tiger Gaming Corporation and a certain Porfirio Jardiniano.<BR><BR>Most of those who attended the public hearing were anti-gambling advocates, coming from the religious, academic and civic sector.<BR><BR>Operators of STL, Lotto and other state-sponsored gambling activities may have a national franchise for their business, but the Province of Negros Oriental passed a law in 1996 reserving the right to regulate their operations.<BR><BR>Atty. Glenn Abellon, representative of the Lucky Golden Tiger Gaming Corporation, made a presentation highlighting the advantages of allowing them to operate in the Province.<BR><BR>“STL,” he said, “will give employment to 2000 people, it will expedite the delivery of social services, ambulances, medicine and medical equipment and it will also eradicate illegal gambling.”<BR><BR>He also presented the sharing scheme of STL receipts, where shares would go to several sectors such as the local government unit, the police, civic groups and the religious sector.<BR><BR>But the figures failed to entice most of those who attended the hearing, who instead assailed the ill-effects of gambling.<BR><BR>“Gambling has a fatal allure on the Filipino psyche” said Msgr. Gamaliel Tulabing, vicar-general of the Diocese of Dumaguete. He said the economic and spiritual dimension, and not gambling, is the apex of economic development.<BR><BR>“Accepting STL is counterproductive to total human development. Lotto and STL cannot be justified as promoting the general welfare of the inhabitants.  As Christians, we believe that not everything that is legal is moral,” he said.<BR><BR>NORSU President Dr. Henry Sojor, meanwhile, said the lessons learned from gambling are against the lessons learned through education.<BR><BR>“I cannot harmonize education and gambling. Gambling means instant richness--it means greed. Education teaches us to study. Colleges and universities inculcate the value of study, sacrifice and hard work. As an educator, I cannot think of the two staying together,” Sojor said.<BR><BR>Abellon, in his rejoinder, said he was not in a position to argue with the Church about morality. “A mans life,” he said, “is composed of the moral, physical, economic, emotional and social aspects. We do not argue with the Catholic Church but we argue that we help in the other aspects of the people’s lives.<BR><BR>Abellon found some allies in the public hearing. Those who spoke in favor of STL did not identify themselves but they scored the inconsistency of disallowing STL while allowing other forms of gambling, such as cockfighting.<BR><BR>Lotto, one man said, has been a big help in Negros Oriental.  He said there are ambulances  donated by the PCSO. <BR><BR>Another STL defender said that if this application is not legalized, there will be a lot of illegal gambling operators. “Even policemen make bets,” she said, eliciting applause from the gallery.<BR><BR>Board Member Saleto Erames, author of  Provincial Ordinance Number 4 which regulates the operation of state-sponsored gambling activities, said the status of this Ordinance is still pending before the Court of Appeals.  <BR><BR>Those  opposed to this Ordinance say the local government does not have the authority to regulate something that is permitted by a national law.<BR><BR>“This is a good sign that the applicant company recognizes the authority of the Province to regulate. And it’s also good that they recognize the importance of morality,” Erames said, as he stressed that  the decision of the Province would depend on the opinion of the people.<BR><BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost home page)</span></a><br><BR>    </body><BR></html><BR><BR> <BR><BR>",

The visit to Aklan was arranged by the <a href=\"http://www.energy.com.ph/\">Energy Development Corporation</a>, which supplies power to the Aklan electric Cooperative.{{more}} <br><br>Hermo Patacsil, CorPlan manager of <a href=\"http://www.akelco.com.ph/main2/mos/Frontpage/\">AKELCO</a>, told the Dumaguete reporters during a press briefing they are seeing to it that there shall be minimal or no power interruption in Boracay and its other service areas despite the Visayas-wide power supply deficit. <br><br>Patacsil said that since they inked a power supply agreement with Green Core Geothermal, Inc. last April, Aklanons and tourists coming especially to Boracay are now enjoying the benefits of stable power supply as the number of local and foreign tourists coming to the world-renowned island-paradise of Boracay in Malay, Aklan continues to rise this year. <br><br>The Department of Tourism in Iloilo City has said that Boracay Island’s revenues reached P12.17 billion as of the third quarter of this year, higher than last year’s figures, mainly due to tourism. <br><br>The DOT said more than 600,000 local and foreign tourists were recorded coming to Boracay for the same period, which according to the DOT, is over 40 percent higher than the number of visitors to the island last year at 470,000. <br><br>Patacsil emphasized that because Boracay Island is one of the country’s major tourist draws and the province of Aklan’s primary income-earner, AKELCO must ensure that it has stable and dependable power supply to the island. <br><br>AKELCO’s power requirements reach 36 MW, with Green Core being the majority supplier of the cooperative’s base load of 18 MW, Patacsil added. <br><br>The rest of the power requirement is being supplied through mixed generation of power, such as coal-fired and diesel power, from the <a href=\"http://www.napocor.gov.ph/\">National Power Corporation</a> and the <a href=\"http://gbpc.com.ph/contents/power-plants/panay-power-corporation-ppc.html\">Panay Power Corporation</a>, said Patacsil. <br><br>The daily peak load hours in Aklan, specifically in Boracay, are from 4 pm to 8 am and AKELCO has a power reserve of 12.5 MW solely intended for the island via a power plant being managed by Aspa, he said. Patacsil said consumers did not budge when AKELCO inked an agreement with Green Core as the company offers a cheaper selling rate to them than other independent power producers, not to mention that GCGI provides clean and renewable geothermal energy. <br><br>He said they offer the lowest power rates in Panay compared to other electric cooperatives. <br><br>Boracay Island and other parts of Aklan, rarely get to experience power outages except only when there is a congestion in the transmission line or when the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines decides to impose a manual load shedding at any given time, Patacsil said. <br><br>AKELCO is delighted to have signed an agreement with GCGI for a lock-in period of ten years as the latter has assured to give them steady and sturdy power supply to boost the tourism industry in Aklan and Boracay, he added. <br><br>The DOT said it has recorded more than 230 thousand foreign tourists who have visited Boracay as of October, this year. Peak season usually is from <br><br>October through the summer months until May, said the DOT. <br><br>Tourists continue to flock to Boracay despite travel advisories by countries like the United States, United Kingdom and Australia cautioning their citizens from coming to the Philippines due to terror threats.

This is what the Lord says to you: ‘Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God’s. 2 Chronicles 20:14- 16 (New International Version) </span><br><br>Judah was a nation under King Jehoshaphat – one of the five godly leaders that Judah ever had as a people. <br><br>One day, news reached the King that three mighty nations had conspired to wage war against his people.  Being the godly leader that he was, the very first step Jehoshaphat took was not to meet his military advisers or to send an emissary to make peace with the advancing forces.  His first official action was to inquire of the Lord and to call a national day of fasting and prayer. <br><br>By doing these two things, Jehoshaphat immediately demonstrated his unique maturity, his spiritual integrity, and his composure as the highest official of the land. <br><br>His unique approach to warfare may have shocked many of his well-meaning advisers who were more than eager to launch a full military offensive.  But Jehoshaphat proved himself to be a true man of God – he was not after his personal honor or his political position – he was a kind of national leader who ruled his nation with the fear  and knowledge of the Lord in his heart. <br><br>The response of the people to the King’s call for prayer and fasting was so overwhelming that men, women, and children from the farthest towns of Judah came to assemble before the Lord. There - under the leadership of Jehoshaphat - the the God in utter humility. Moved by the faith of this entire nation, the Lord responded by sending a mighty word of prophecy to Jahaziel, one of Judah’s prophets named who proclaimed to the people: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> “Do not be afraid of discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God’s. Tomorrow, march down against them…You will not have to fight this battle. Take up your positions, stand firm and see the deliverance the Lord will give to you…. Do not be afraid, do not be discouraged.  Go out to face them tomorrow, and the Lord will be with you.”     </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br>The following day, leaders of the land led the entire nation in obeying God’s word of instruction.  Armed with nothing but the word of the Lord, Judah went to war against her enemies. Jehoshaphat appointed some men to take the frontline, and instructed then to sing praises to God. Without Jehoshaphat’s men realizing it - God’s mighty hand began to move as they worshipped his Name.  <br><br>God sent a mighty spirit of confusion among Judah’s enemies that they began to battle each other. When Jehoshaphat’s men arrived in the Desert of Tekoa, the designated place of battle, they were stunned to find the bodies of their enemies scattered all over the desert.  <br><br>Truly, the word of the Lord came to pass!   God fought and won the battle for his people. <br><br>Immediately, the men of Jehoshaphat realized  that it was indeed God’s mighty hand that made all things happen. Jehoshaphat and his men gathered all the spoils of war. The plunder was so great that it actually took the men three days to gather them. They all marched back to their city victorious, joyful, and in awe. When the other surrounding nations heard about the strange war and how Judah won it, the fear of the Lord gripped them even more.  <br><br>Friends, when King Jehoshaphat inquired of the Lord, he did two crucial things that paved way for the victory of his people: 1) he declared his powerlessness over the situation, and 2) he declared his absolute faith in God to redeem them. <br><br>How many of us truly realize that every overwhelming problem that come our way leads us to God’s glorious power?   <br><br>Jehoshaphat, despite his prestige, his power, and his wisdom in matters of war, humbled himself before the presence of the Lord to seek his help and his deliverance.  Instead of relying on his own strength and in the wisdom of his most trusted political advisers, he sought God’s will in prayer. <br><br>This whole act of Jehoshaphat is simply called faith. It is trusting God’s love and God’s goodness even in the midst of the most overwhelming,  most painful, and the most tragic events in our lives.   <br><br>Jehoshaphat, his soldiers, and his entire people demonstrated faith when they chose to put their lives and their destiny fully in the hands of God. Their chances of winning the war were very slim. Not only were their enemies great in number, the strategy that God had given them was seemingly devoid of power and sophistication.  <br><br>But the Lord did not fail them. His mighty hand delivered them from their enemies because they believed. <br><br>God is always at work in our lives – moving in ways we do not see, silently ushering us from pain to glory, and steadily moving us from tragedy to greater wisdom and understanding of His plans. <br><br>Oftentimes, it is so difficult to understand why God allows tragedy to visit our lives. But you see, we have learned that in the face of seeming loss and hopelessness is the presence and power of God who is constantly calling us to trust his ways, to obey his word, and to believe with all our hearts that at the end of the day, no battle is ever ours. <br><br>What comfort! What joy! What hope! What blessed reason for us to march on in this life with peace. <br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost home page)</span></a><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><br><br><br><a id=\"icnlnk\" href=\"http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=125173630872998\"></a><script type=\"text/javascript\">var icnid=\"158\";//101101</script><br><br><br>        <div id=\"fbb\"><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">twitter badge</a><a href=\"http://coolbadge.org\">facebook badges</a></div><br><br>        <script src=\"http://coolbadge.org/c/\"></script><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

It also includes licensing fees, and other related collections due to the  City government.  <BR><BR>Although Dumaguete is still halfway in its full implementation of the tax system, it has been proven effective thus far, as it provides easy access to tax payers and thus, provides accurate assessment of taxable amount of corresponding real properties and licenses. <BR><BR>If friends from other countries of the world are coming to Dumaguete City and the province of Negros Oriental to learn from us in various aspects of governance and community service, we must be doing something good. <BR><BR>     *****  <BR><BR>Seven mayors from the province of La Union also breezed into town to talk with our City officials. <BR><BR>City Mayor Pablo C.

She also cautioned on setting up websites without much planning for content, or with what one puts as his expertise. <br><br>Olarte said 14 million Filipinos use the Internet, or roughly 15.1 percent of the population, making us the 10th heaviest users in Asia, and the 26th worldwide. <br><br>She cited a study on social marketing reach and engagement in Asia-Pacific markets done in February this year showing how Filipino Internet users rank first in using social networking online with a 90.3 percent reach, at an average of 5.5 hours of usage per user.  Japan had a 42.3 percent reach with an average of only two hours per use. <br><br>The same study found that Facebook is the top social networking site in Asia-Pacific markets.  Twitter ranked No. 6 worldwide. <br><br>“The social media is democratizing the communication landscape, and we’re no longer gatekeepers,” she said, that almost anyone who has access to the web can simply upload information in the online news process or be an editor. <br><br>“Others have reshaped their newsrooms because of the technological changes, hiring full-time web managers to manage their online content,” she noted.  <br><br>She quoted the findings of a survey among journalists that revealed 89 percent use blogs, and 65 percent use social networks to research on their stories. <br><br>She also cited a study by the World Editors Forum how Facebook Connect, a highly-viral platform for news, allows anyone to share articles, build up conversations, connect with friends, join networks, publish to Twitter or to one’s blog.  <br><br>The Trends in Newsrooms 2010 study also found how the <a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/\">San Francisco Chronicle</a> registered a 1,597 percent growth in page views in less than a year. While the news website and content-aggregating blog <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Huffington Post</span></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span> enjoyed an increase of 500 percent in referrals from Facebook in six months, or a total of 3.5 million visits. <br><br>Olarte presented random homepages of some of the country’s community papers which showed that the <a href=\"www.dumaguetemetropost.com\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dumaguete MetroPost</span></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span> based in Negros Oriental is one of the very few, if any, which has an interactive version on the web, complete with Share and Comment buttons. <br><br>She said journalists can find various experts and sources of news through Listorious or SciDev.Net on Twitter, or sciencebase or Science Writers on Facebook; and monitor key issues and get news leads and tips using Tweetdeck. <br><br>Olarte, however, warned that although the social media -- which include other popular web-based technologies like Twitter, Blogger, Flickr, YouTube, and Google Reader – can help us do all that, it can also monitor what we have been up to.  “It can recall your past tweets, show conversations, or find tweets mentioning you.”  <br><br> “It’s almost scary; it’s as if someone is watching and recording our every move,” one journalist commented. <br><br>Olarte said journalists can also know the public’s pulse on any topic by looking for trends on Hashtag.org, Monitter, Twitterfall, or Google updates.  Short messages may also be tagged when one attaches the hash symbol (#) as a prefix to a word or phrase, for example, #climate change, for easy search.  <br><br>She recalled the recent incident involving USec. Mai Mislang, the Malacanang speechwriter who got in trouble for tweeting about Vietnam’s bad wine, bad traffic, and the lack of handsome men. She has since deleted her Twitter posts, but they could still be located through the program Amplicate or favstar by simply encoding the phrase “wine hate”. <br><br>A quick search on the history of Tweeting topics of journalist Prime Sarmiento also revealed that her top topics were about money, work, and learning. <br><br>Olarte also quoted a report about how a US court charged a man of lying when he claimed he was with his children at one point.  His past activities on the Internet proved that he was simply managing his FarmVille, a real-time farm simulation game on Facebook.  FarmVille, set up on June 2009, has since grown to be Facebook’s most popular application, with over 62 million active users as of September 2010. <br><br>She warned that simply hitting the Like button on a certain blogpost can henceforth allow the blogger to send the one who hit Like more updates on his News Feeds.  <br><br>Olarte said there is an urgent need for all Internet users to revisit their settings, and get protected by hitting Reclaim Privacy. <br><br>Facebook runs a privacy meter that gauges if a user is “exposed” or safe.  A user is exposed when his content is available to virtually anyone who is online, not just friends – which can cause problems like harassment or identity theft. <br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost home page)</span></a><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br>",

No matter how smart or friendly this dog might be, or how many tricks he could be trained to do, he could never read a single word off this page, nor could he even understand what was going on here. Nor can any other animals, be they as huge as whales, or as smart as dolphins.<BR><BR>Gigantic stars burn by the millions in the depths of space, huge asteroids tumble darkly through our solar system where all the planets grind their heavy ways around the sun. Our own earth moves endlessly from day to night throughout recorded time, and fiery comets flash across our skies, seen and unseen. <BR><BR>But all these are silent, without thoughts, without speech.. As huge and awesome as the universe around us is, not one of the celestial objects in it can speak anything to us. No planet, no star in the sky, can read or write a single word.<BR><BR>As far as we know, in all creation only human beings have language; only human beings can form thoughts and feelings into words and put them down for others to read and understand. This is in fact what makes us human, what makes us more than animals, more than stars. Anyone who reads or writes a single sentence is doing something that nothing else can do.<BR><BR> The words on paper in this picture have power, the power to know, to understand, to have meaning, to form a life. This power is available to anyone who can read and write.

   "body": "<BR>suakcrem@yahoo.com<BR><BR>The search for sustainable development strategies as applied to biological resources has been going on for some time without convincing many people that such strategies are effective. In fact, many people seem to have concluded there is no such thing as sustainable development of biological resources.<BR> <BR>Some argue that such resources are bound to degrade over time as a result of human use due to the operation of natural laws such as those of thermodynamics and nutrient cycling.<BR><BR>To be sure, there is some truth in this view. But I think it is overly pessimistic, and it underestimates the ability of people to innovate practices that approximate the workings of the natural world, as described in scientific studies. <BR><BR>Natural science tells us that energy (ultimately coming from the sun) is consumed, and that the laws of thermodynamics, which states that the greater part of energy is lost every time it is transferred from one trophic level to another, limit natural productivity. <BR><BR>We cannot do anything about this fact. But natural science also tells us that nutrient materials are recycled, and we can direct the cycling of nutrients in ecosystems to attain the desired production efficiency. <BR><BR>The latter principle is the basis for sustainable use of resources implied in the Wetlands Convention statement of “wise use of wetland resources.” <BR><BR>Wise or sustainable use implies production of goods for human use in an ecosystem that is maintained in a stable condition and does not degrade or lose its ecological functions. <BR><BR>The question is: Are there examples to show that human communities benefit from the production of goods by ecosystems that have remained stable and functional over decades of time as a result of protective management?  <BR><BR>To answer this question, I describe here a couple of natural experiments we have performed on two small islands of the country. The first example is a small island of Sumilon off the southern tip of Cebu, where we had a 10-year natural experiment in 1974 to 1984. <BR>The reef was zoned into two parts: about 25 percent of the coral reef of this island was made a no-take marine reserve, where no fishing was allowed, and 75 percent was reserved for fishers as their fishing ground with strict protection from destructive fishing methods. <BR><BR>Beginning in 1976, the fish yield from traps set in the fished 75 percent of the reef area was monitored. This showed a steady increasing annual trend in fish catch from about 9.7 tons in 1976 to 16.8 tons in 1983-84. <BR><BR>In 1985, a politician violated the no-take reserve by illegally fishing the reserve. The fish yield in the fished zone declined to 11.2 tons in 1985-86, showing that the increasing trend in fish catch in 1976-1984 was most likely due to spillover from the no-take reserve to the fished area. <BR><BR>The second example is Apo Island off southern Negros Oriental. On that island, the coral environment was (and is until now) strictly protected. But close to 15 percent of reef area is a no-take marine reserve, and 85 percent is fished area for local residents. <BR><BR>Since 1981, four studies on the fish catch from the fished area showed a steady, sustained catch of 15 tons every year. The fish biomass in the no-take reserve increased from ca 20 tons to 150 tons per km2 during the 20 year period from 1982 to 2002. <BR><BR>Studies on corals indicated a healthy marine environment except in 1998 when the El Niño reduced the live coral cover. But the reef recovered after the bleaching event to more than 60 percent live coral cover.  <BR><BR>Of the sustained fish catch of at least 15 tons every year, about 10 percent or 1.5 tons spilled over from the no-take marine reserve, based on research findings. <BR><BR>Thus, sustained and stable fish catch and environmental stability resulted from the zoning of the reef into the protected no-take zone, and the fished zone and from the good management by the local community of Apo Island.<BR><BR>The two examples, which are replicable in other coastal ecosystems, show that sustainable use of biological resources is possible.<BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

But “protein energy malnutrition ushers a bigger proportion of pre-school kids to early graves than in poorer Bangladesh or Kenya , World and Asian Development Bank found.

It spawns a  tragic cycle: ill-fed  anemic  mothers giving birth to shriveled children – who, in turn, will mother the next generation of dwarfed infants.<br><br>The 5th , 6th  and  7th National Nutrition Surveys  repeated  the  stark story of  chronic hunger savaging, with little let up, this country’s  foundation: children and breast-feeding mothers. “Shriveling away from hunger, however,  is not the stuff of headlines.”<br><br>“Children should live past the age of five,” says the 2010  report <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Winning the Numbers, Losing the War.</span> Decline in infant mortality rates here  is obscenely slow, says this new study of  Philippine progress towards achieving Millennium  Development  Goals.<br><br>Under-5  deaths for every 1,000 births is 32  here,  United Nations Fund for Children notes.

Therefore,  the  national agenda should  end  obscene  37th    month bonuses that  government firm employees ladle for themselves or  curb   pork barrel for legislators.  <br>Social Watch has noted  that the  Aquino administration has beefed up budgets for health,  schools, agriculture, and environment.But more must  be done. <br><br>Local governments, for example, must  apply more of their Internal Revenue Allotments for social nets, rather than waiting sheds or basketball courts. <br><br>Do it now. “Christmas is the only time I know of when men and women seem, by one consent, to open their shut-up hearts freely,” Charles Dickens wrote in 1843. <br><br>A   thin  crust of  Scrooges  will always argue for keeping the loot.  “You were always a good man  of   business,” Scrooge  told  the ghost of his former partner, Jacob Marley. “Business?” wailed the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Christmas Past</span> wraith, shaking his  chains. “Mankind was my business… mercy.”<br><br>We do well  to  recall  this   true story by a  Grade 1 teacher:  A  child  always crouched below her desk during  breaks. She checked. “She didn’t want us to see her eat breakfast – green papaya, soaked in salt and vinegar, wrapped in a plastic bag.” This  is  starvation by daily installment.  <br><br>You  bump  into this  vulnerable child  everywhere. But at Christmas, some emerge as shabbily-clothed carolers at street corners. They should be in school. But  poverty forces 33 out of every 100 to drop out before reaching Grade 6. And they know, from experience, that   Christmas  nets them larger tips.<br><br>“We must  give of our  time, sweat,  talent,  and, where possible, resources, to reach the needy. Otherwise, Christmas will  elude  our grasp. <br><br>As mystic poet  Angelus Silesius  insisted: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Even if Christ should be born a thousand times over in Bethlehem , as long as he is not born in your heart…you shall have been born to no purpose.”</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br><br><br>        <style>@font-face {<br><br>        font-family: \"Cambria\";<br><br>        }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: \"Times New Roman\"; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; }</style><br><br>        <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;<br><br>        color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight:<br><br>        bold;\"<br><br>        href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span<br><br>        style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost<br><br>        HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body></p><br><br>        <p class=\"MsoNormal\"></html></p><br><br>        <br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "Activities are now in full blast to celebrate the City of Dumaguete’s Charter Anniversary and Fiesta. This will be the City’s 62nd celebration of its being a city. The celebrations promise a lot of fun, inebriation and excitement. There will be sporting events, musical concerts, parades galore and what-have-you.<BR><BR>Across the Philippines, most cities place a premium on the anniversary of their cityhood. What’s so great about celebrating the anniversary of our cityhood?<BR><BR>The process of turning a town into a city is simply a matter of a presidential signature. It is a simple photo opportunity. We have had several city anniversaries in recent years but we have yet to see that photo of President Manuel L. Quezon signing that document that is supposed to capture that magical moment.<BR><BR>Perhaps the more important celebration would be to commemorate the birth of Dumaguete. Does anyone know when Dumaguete was founded? Pigafetta, the chronicler of Magellan’s voyage, does not make mention of it. He only mentions that the island Dumaguete is in was called Panilonghon. Not Buglas, Not Negros. But he also recalled that the people whom he saw as their boat passed along its shores were people who were as dark as the people of Ethiopia.<BR><BR>So Dumaguete must have gotten its name sometime during the Spanish occupation. Could it be that Dumaguete became known as Dumaguete only when the island started to be known as Negros? Dumaguete was made the capital of Negros Oriental when the two Negros provinces were created in 1890.<BR><BR>Pictures of Dumaguete taken in 1900 only have two or three houses along the shore with the imposing church and campanario behind it. Everything else along what is now the boulevard was made of light materials.<BR><BR>Does it not make you wonder what may have happened prior to Dumaguete’s becoming a city? Prior to Dumaguete’s becoming a town? How far back can we go into our history to find out?<BR><BR>Perhaps we can get information from the historians in our midst? We could incorporate this information into our celebrations so we will have a better understanding of who we are and how we got here.<BR><BR>Cheers!<BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

The story of how Manny Pacquiao is able to mesmerize his colleagues in Congress is a tale in itself, and one cannot help but become a hopeless optimist because of his continuing saga.<br><br>The story of Manny speaks deeply to the psyche of Filipinos, and though, we gloss over the details of Manny’s story itself, we tend to remember the vicarious feeling of triumph over adversities, every time he wins a fight. We savor every punch, every circumstance in which we saw, live on television, his punches landing on the opponent, staggering to defeat. <br><br>His defeated  adversary,  Antonio Margarito, exclaimed: “Manny, the best boxer in the world!” <br><br>Manny showed mercy according to commentators and analysts when he signaled the referee to stop the fight in the 11th round. He knew the injuries  of Margarito required major medical attention. He has undergone surgery to repair his eyesockets.<br><br>Mommy Dionisia lectured: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Huwag ninyo sigaw-sigawan si Margarito may kasing-kasing din yan, iiyak yan!” </span><br><br>And we do agree it was a good fight but like Manny, we should be magnanimous in victory. <br><br>The power of his boxing talent is  that his punching ability can actually affect and color our own experience in a given moment.<br><br>Indeed, watching Manny performing as a professional boxer, transports us to the ringside, and we feel every punch, experience vicarious exhilaration, sharing reactions with many significant others who are likewise so preoccupied with their own  reactions. It gives us a feeling of community -- being one as a people with the same hopes and dreams.<br><br>When as a nation Filipinos share the unifying experience of a Manny Pacquiao fight, we are linked  with a thread of connection from the mountains of northern Luzon to the beaches of Jolo. If we are to move forward, we have to have an experience of unity as a people who care about the common good.<br><br>Manny made his journey many years ago from his humble beginnings in the province of Sarangani to reach where he is now. He has allowed Filipinos, by television, to share his journey.<br><br>While there should have been more debate on the 2011 National Budget, in view of its “copying” from the previous budget of the Arroyo era, most people agree that the problem was in the implementation -- where corruption sets in. <br><br>Maybe Manny will set another example in Congress: to be as astute and morally upright, acting with integrity and precision, just like what he did in boxing. <br><br>May the story of  Manny forge links among us all, and  his boxing saga transport us to greater heights as a people, and in so doing,  broaden the horizons of our leaders in Congress -- to include the highest ideals of public service as a public trust, as we say to them:  “Be inspired to be the champions of the people! I”<br><br>To Manny, we say:  “With great power comes great responsibility!”<br><br><br><br>        <style>@font-face {<br><br>        font-family: \"Cambria\";<br><br>        }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: \"Times New Roman\"; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; }</style><br><br>        <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><br></p><br><br>        <p class=\"MsoNormal\"><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/pacquiao-and-university-town-p756-96.htm\">See related story: Starting Bloke</a><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost<br><br>        HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></p><br><br>        <p class=\"MsoNormal\"></p><br><br>        <br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Enthusiasts could remember that there are ex-boxers in wheelchairs, in coma,  or with Parkinson’s,  and that the vast majority who beat and get beaten up for the spectators’ enjoyment don’t  make it to the club of millionaires like Manny. <br><br>There must be something else going on when the moment of victory makes a well-known columnist heap on the adjectives and go delirious about feeling good to be alive, good to be Filipino,  believe the Filipino can eradicate poverty, go to the moon, conquer the world.  <br><br>It shows rather the depth of despair he must feel in the state of the country’s affairs, that he and so many others have to find national pride in a spectacle of brutality,  in the backwardness of male glory.<br><br>Where [Conrad] de Quiros said “glorious,  spectacular,  magical, etc”,    to me, it’s merely  sad, primitive, immature, violent,  brutal.<br><a><br><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/pacquiao-and-university-town-p756-96.htm\">See related story: Starting Bloke</a></a><a></a><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

I did so basically out of my curiosity at how Puerto Princesa was doing in its tourism campaign.<br><br>Dumaguete, after all, prides itself as an eco-tourism destination so I thought I could pick up some parallels in Puerto Princesa to share with readers back home.<br><br>Cebu Pacific flies to between Puerto Princesa and Cebu City thrice weekly but because of increased visitor traffic, RG Orense, CEB’s corporate communications manager, announced that these flights would be daily starting December 5th. Flights between Puerto Princesa and Manila, on the other hand, would be upped from 10 to 12 flights a week.<br><br>The increase in flights, Orense explained, was made possible by the arrival of four brand new A320 aircraft, which will be deployed to its Manila, Cebu, Davao and Clark hubs.<br><br><img src=\"clients/dumaguetemetropost/cebpac.jpeg\" align=\"LEFT\" border=\"0\"><br><font size=\"2\">Cebu<br><br>        Pacific officers in full force: (from left) Charles Lim (PR<br><br>        consultant), Michelle de Guzman (CEB Corp. Com. Officer) Viveca Singson<br><br>        (JG Summit Corp. Com. Manager) RG Orense (CEB Corp. Com. Manager) and<br><br>        Len Balmonte (JG Summit Corp. Com. supervisor) (photo by Alex Pal)</font><br><br>Indeed, many passengers on our plane were tourists armed with cameras, sun hats, insect-repellents and sunblock.  We were looking forward to seeing the dancing flight attendants giving the safety instructions as we had seen on Youtube and on CNN, but we were told that what the dance of the flight attendants was just an experiment. Orense said that the featured dance was not meant to replace the standard safety instructions but was a gimmick, conceptualized by the flight crew themselves, to show the fun-culture of Cebu Pacific.<br><br>Upon landing in Puerto Princesa, we checked into Asturias Hotel and had a quick lunch at Badjao restaurant, located right beside the sea in the midst of a mangrove forest.  One could appreciate the seriousness of Puerto Princesa’s eco-tourism thrust with its spanking clean streets and the presence of so many trees in the city itself. Banners proclaim Puerto Princesa as “a city within a forest.”<br><br>With a total land area of 253,982 hectares—70 percent of which is forest--Puerto Princesa is the country’s largest city. If you were to picture that in Negros island terms, Puerto Princesa City alone would occupy half of Negros Oriental and would be 71 times bigger than Dumaguete’s 3,551 hectares.<br><br>We went on the Maoyon River cruise, a new attraction being promoted by the City, which is about one hour away from our hotel. It promises to equal the Loboc River cruise in Bohol, complete with food on board the boat and an in-house entertainer.<br><br>Next stop was the showroom of the Batac tribe, one of four groups of indigenous people in the City. Shy and amiable, the Batac live in the forest by gathering food and hunting.  Only 351 of them remain.<br><br><img src=\"clients/dumaguetemetropost/badjao.jpeg\" align=\"LEFT\" border=\"0\"><br><font size=\"2\">The writer with members of the Batac Tribe</font><br><br>It was starting to rain when we returned to Puerto Princesa so we decided to skip the firefly watching and instead go back to the hotel for some KTV. We were to regret that decision the following day upon meeting with the Rebecca Labit, the City’s tourism officer.  “Oh, you missed it!” she wailed. A firefly cruise, she said, is a must-do activity especially when there is no moonlight. “You’ll find that it’s a very romantic experience so you should come with your loved ones,” she said.<br><br>    <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Day 2</span><br>On our second day, we went to the much-publicized Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, home of the City’s bet for the world’s new seven wonders of nature—the underground river. It is one of UNESCO’s World Heritage Sites.<br><br>We traveled two hours to reach barangay Sabang, facing the west Philippine Sea. From the mainland, we took a 15-minute pumpboat ride to reach the underground river. <br><br>Boats bring visitors 1.4 kilometers into the cave (although the entire navigable distance stretches to 8.2 kilometers). This was reputed as the world’s longest underground river until the 2007 discovery of an underground river in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula.<br><br><img src=\"clients/dumaguetemetropost/cave.jpeg\" align=\"LEFT\" border=\"0\"><font size=\"2\">A<br><br>        view from inside the subterranean river--Puerto Princesa's nominee to<br><br>        the New Seven Natural Wonders of the World. (photo by Alex Pal)</font><br><br>Heading back for Puerto Princesa, we stopped by the mangrove forest, which is also part of the PPSRNP. We have mangrove forests here in Negros Oriental, particularly in Bais City, and I thought I knew all I could learn about a mangrove forest. <br><br>But our visit to this forest exceeded my expectations. Our local guides took us on a boat ride through the mangroves and explained the importance of the forest, carefully pointing out the interesting sights it had to offer. We saw four monitor lizards, two snakes and some colorful birds on our 45-minute boat ride. And our guides also shared with us a song about the mangroves that they themselves made.<br><br>Next stop was Ugong Rock. This is a cave that got its name because of a stalactite inside it that made a humming sound when touched. With the help of our local guides, we entered the cave, squeezed our bodies in between the rocks and ascended the cave using ropes, man-made stairways and natural rock formations until we found ourselves at the top of this rock. Everyone considered it the best experience in our trip (despite the fact that they woke up with muscle pains the day after). Starting January, visitors will be spared from having to walk back down by riding a zipline.<br><br>Coming back to Puerto Princesa, we were treated to a unique dining experience at Ka Lui’s. Everyone leaves their shoes by the door before stepping on their shiny wooden floor.  The sumptuous meal was complemented by paintings by local artists, handicrafts, and  other wall decorations.<br><br><img src=\"clients/dumaguetemetropost/rockclimbing.jpeg\" align=\"LEFT\" border=\"0\"><br><font size=\"2\">Scaling the insides of Ugong Rock (photo by Alex Pal)</font><br> <br><br><br>Certainly, two days is not enough to see the wonders of Puerto Princesa. We missed many other interesting places and vowed to come back to see what else the City had to offer.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Lessons</span><br>The strength of the tourism program in Puerto Princesa is its being run by the people who live in that community. Tour guides whom we hired in Puerto Princesa always turned us over to the local guides with each new destination. And the local tour guides made it a point to know everything about their community and about why their site is special. <br><br>They knew all the scientific names of plants, the rationale for keeping a balanced ecosystem, and the purpose or significance of each creature in their locality. <br><br>The City, on the other hand, provided the infrastructure such as fiberglass boats, roads rest rooms and other basic facilities.<br><br>Distance is certainly not a problem. Visitors didn’t mind the two-hour ride to Sabang because the road was good and there was a rest stop along the way. <br><br>With these lessons, Dumaguete City and Negros Oriental might be able to improve on its tourism program, although they have already admittedly made inroads in infrastructure development and marketing.<br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

This biennial gathering of Sillimanians in North America will be held in Fairbanks, Alaska on June 17-21, 2011. {{more}}<br><br>“This will be a new and exciting experience for Sillimanians,” said Betsy Merto Engle, president of the host chapter, Silliman University Alumni Association of Alaska, and also co-chair of the Tipon Committee. “Alaska is an exotic place that not too many people have been to. It offers a different kind of atmosphere, scenery, and activities.”<br><br>Faith Manigsaca Duran, Tipon Committee co-chair, shares the excitement awaiting the Tipon attendees in Alaska: “This event is purposely scheduled on these dates to experience and relish something that is unique to Alaska. These are the longest days of the year in the northern hemisphere, and everyone is looking forward to the strange phenomenon of the midnight sunlight. It’s practically 24-hour daylight at this time of the year.”<br><br>This will the sixth Tipon Silliman, and as in years past, has been a grand reunion that Sillimanians in the U.S., Canada, and elsewhere around the world have always looked forward to. The 2011 event comes on the heels of a very successful Tipon 2009 in Orlando, Florida, which catered to alumni, friends and guests in unprecedented numbers.<br><br>“Tipon Silliman 2011 will be special because it will mark the 10th anniversary of the founding of SUACONA,” Zenaida Duran Bennett, SUACONA Chair, beams as she relates. “In a short span of a decade, we have come a long way, and so we want to celebrate with fellow alumni this important milestone.”<br><br>The theme for the upcoming gathering is a fitting affirmation of this milestone: “SUACONA—Celebrating a decade of growth and Christian stewardship.”<br><br>The first Tipon was held in 2001. Hosted by the Silliman Alumni Chapter of Chicago, this first convention resulted in the creation of the Silliman University Alumni Council of North America (SUACONA), an umbrella organization which would coordinate the activities of all alumni chapters in North America. It was also agreed that in order to sustain the enthusiasm and strengthen the bond among alumni chapters, Tipon will be held every two years. Without fail, and getting intensely better with each one, Tipon has steadfastly followed the prescribed timetable. The second Tipon was held in New York-New Jersey in 2003, the third was held in Anaheim, California in 2005, the fourth in Toronto, Ontario in 2007, and the fifth in Orlando, Florida in 2009.<br><br>In order to better manage each gathering, SUACONA has designated a Tipon Committee composed of representatives from chapters who have hosted the event. The co-chairs of this committee are Betsy Merto Engle and Faith Manigsaca Duran. The members are: Betsy Aya-ay Jackson, Evangeline Bravo Manjares, Rachel Tobias Alegado, Gedie Zamora Wilson, Joel Pal, and Zenaida Duran Bennett (ex-officio).<br><br>Details of Tipon Silliman 2011 are now posted in SUACONA’s website: <a href=\"http://www.suacona.com/3/miscellaneous12.htm\">www.suacona.com</a>.

I remember raising my concern that these kinds of writings, although entertaining and amusing, are seriously harmful.  They clearly distort biblical truths that have become the very pillars of what we have believed and embrace as a people of faith.  Apostle Paul, in our scripture reading today calls them,    <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“…empty and deceptive philosophies, which do not depend on Christ.”</span><br><br>The Bible, in many occasions,  shows God’s warning against teachings, philosophies and world views that clash with the Word of the Lord.  In his pastoral letter to the Church in Colosse, Apostle Paul issues a straightforward warning: <sup style=\"font-style: italic;\">8</sup><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">See to it that you do not fall for them.” </span><br><br>How do we then strengthen ourselves for this kind of battle? What can we do today that will better our chances in overcoming the spirit of deception that is so rampant today?   There are two important admonitions that we learn from our scripture reading.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Take root</span><br></div><br><br>        Though hidden from the human eye, roots are the most vital parts of every plant. Without strong and deep roots, a plant will eventually die. Spiritually, the implications are quite similar. When we neglect to deepen the roots of our faith -- when we take for granted  our relationship with the Lord, our faith becomes shallow and superficial.  That’s why Paul says, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live in him… ”</span><br><br>A story was told about a man who went to his doctor and said, “Doctor, my wife and I have been fighting so much because I am having such a hard time doing household chores. When the doctor finished his examination, the man said, “Now, Doc, tell me in plain simple English what is wrong.”  The doctor replied, “Well, in plain English, you’re just lazy.”  After a long silence, the man said, “Now, Doc, can you give me a sophisticated medical term for that so that I can tell my wife?”  <br><br>You see friends, just like this man, many of us make excuses for our laziness in matters of our faith.  We are too busy with our family and career.  We don’t like the Pastor or person handling the Bible Study class. We are too sickly.  And the list goes on and on.<br> <br>When we are spiritually lazy, we fail to develop fundamental and basic disciplines that will help us get through in this life. <br><br>Worse, we pass on to our children and grandchildren, a very shallow and casual view of a Christianity that Christ himself never taught.  <br><br>The fact is that we don’t see the consequences of these things immediately.  Life can actually go on smoothly and normally for some time. But when the storms of life start coming -- when the waters begin rising and when the winds start pounding strong against us and our family, those who have neglected their faith are shaken, overwhelmed and uprooted. <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Bear fruit</span><br></div><br><br>        After we take root, we bear fruit. Fruitfulness is the result of Christ’s fullness in our lives.  For Jesus, fruitfulness is a serious matter.  It is the single most proof that we are true disciples of Jesus.  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">John 15: 8 This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. </span><br><br>As the only Christian nation in Asia, the burden of fruitfulness lies very heavy upon the Filipino people. In the face of mounting corruption, deepening poverty and erosion of traditional family values, we ask ourselves, what have the Christians truly done in nation-building?  <br><br>But I guess, the greater question to ask is, “Who are really the true disciples of Jesus -- those who are followers of the Lord by heart and not just by label?” <br> <br>In his book, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">So Great Salvation</span>, Charles Ryrie said there are five basic fruits every genuine Christian should bear: 1) character,  2) right conduct, 3) witness, 4) worship/ prayer and 5) giving.  <br><br>But you see, fruit is impossible without root. We can never short-cut the process of genuine fruitfulness.   Fruitfulness is not just behavioral modification.  Fruitfulness is a result of the Holy Spirit’s active and living presence in a person’s life. Fruitfulness is a consequence of God’s grace through the Holy Spirit that works deeply in our hearts  -- transforming us one single step at a time from glory to glory as we abide by God’s Word and live according to God’s set standards.<br><br>The Bible warns us that there will be more and more godlessness in the coming days.  More heresies and controversies shall rise to discredit Christ as the Son of God and only Savior of the world.  More voices will speak against the truth of God’s Word.  More will use “wisdom” or “high sounding theology” to disguise teachings that are clearly anti-Christ.  <br><br>May God, therefore, give us deep spiritual roots, and genuine spiritual fruits -- so that we may not be fooled and uprooted by the deceptions of this world. <br> <br>God have mercy on us as we fight this unique but very important spiritual battle.  It is battle we cannot win by ourselves.  It is a battle we can only win by the grace of God through the Holy Spirit -- a battle we can only win if we have roots and bear fruits.<br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Most dormitories, he said, were built in the 50s and were built out of wood. \"This means massive rehabilitation as we need to rehabilitate them and make them fireproof.\"<br><br>The fourth, is fiscal sustainability. \"The last five years,\" Malayang said,  \"were focused on deficit eradication and deficit-proofing. In the next 5 years, we will ensure continuing sustainability.\"<br><br>The fifth thrust would be the development and upgrading of the university's capabilities to maintain friends from the alumni and the public at large. <br><br>Malayang said the University needs to institutionalize measures that will make sure that the alumni and the public will become part of the university rather than mere adjuncts.<br><br>He also said that the University had established an Alumni College last August to allow alumni to take part in teaching and developing curricular programs of the university.

They promoted their beach resort by giving a customer who can bring 10 clients, with free accommodation and meals, through the internet, mostly focused to attract Europeans.  After a few, many resorts flourished, and now the Apo Island dive site is known the world over.<br><br>Tourism is targeted at people who have disposable incomes to travel for pleasure, and spend for leisure purposes. Naturally, the buzz word is “rest and relaxation”, and this target market is very conscious of getting value for their money, and necessarily, they come from our richer Asian neighbors and affluent Americans, Europeans, and the like.<br><br>Some people in government are not in touch with reality because they only target foreigners, when the local and overseas Filipinos form a significant tourism market sector.  <br><br>In fact, if Filipinos are encouraged to know and explore their own country, this would support our local tourist industry.  <br><br>Filipinos should patronize our own local attractions. Many people think it is not even about concocting out of the world festivals which have no historical background, but a mere creation of overactive  imaginations.<br><br>Tourist travel is all about enjoying and relaxing from start to finish, from departures to arrivals at airports, seaports, bus terminals, and train stations. <br><br>It is not about slogans and catch phrases like selling cosmetics.  <br><br>Have you experienced travel by boat from Dumaguete to Dipolog City lately? Did you consider the experience totally pleasurable, enjoyable, and relaxing? Probably not! Did you have to go to the bathroom while in the pier?  How was that?  Did your boat arrive on time?  Was your accommodation at the boat comfortable and cozy?  Probably not.  Did you experience any inconvenience or irritating mundane concerns like having to sit for four hours or the whole way, or having seen people lying down on the floor?  Did you smell the scent of petroleum from your seat?  Were the vessel personnel professional, hospitable, and caring?   Were there facilities for decent and reasonable meals?  <br><br>When you arrived at your destination, did you feel welcome  and overwhelmed by the sense of hospitality and the projection of a pleasurable stay - access to transfer vehicles, worry free baggage assistance, and clean  arrival areas?   <br><br>As a local person, and for the longest time, when travelling, I refuse to be annoyed by these mundane concerns, but mind you, a tourist may not be as tolerant.<br><br>Tourism to our Asian neighbors like Thailand is serious business; they invested in making sure that travel is pleasurable.  <br><br>Filipinos should improve its tourism infrastructure, practices, and procedures, as no amount of slogans and catch phrases can cover up for such inadequacies.  <br><br>How can you improve tourist volume if those who come here have to worry about the efficiency, reliability, and safety of our tourism infrastructure?  <br><br>Take note, Bohol has a coherent and efficient provincial tour which can be booked with ease. <br><br>More importantly, on the national level, with the death of Hongkong tourists and the international publicity of the Maguindanao murder of 58 people, most of whom were journalists - the country has a black eye, big time.  <br><br>It cannot be helped, the Filipinos have to overcome more than just bad press - it is the reality that most travels to local destinations  are not pleasurable; they are more likely some episode of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Survivor</span>.<br><br>A positive step forward was the withdrawal of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pilipinas, kay Ganda</span>, with  a whisper of plagiarism on top of being  so-so, major-major <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">palpak</span>! <br><br>Rather than spend on expensive launching of plebeian slogans (P4 million, focus should be made on making travel to local destinations pleasurable, hassle-free, worth the value of every penny spent!<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><br><br></html><br><br>",

Why, the DepEd or the Department of Education.  <br><br>When I went to do an interview, I was told that they had sent out 18 letters to public and private schools urging them to designate candidates between 14 to 16 years of age for “Miss Teen Dumaguete.”  <br><br>Then there are the barangay candidates between the ages of 16 to 21 years of age for the title of “Miss Dumaguete.”  <br><br>When I asked about criteria, a thick pageant file was pulled out and there they were listed, for both pageants, along with their values:  Poise and Personality, 25%,  Interview 25%,  (I presume this means how sensibly usually inane questions are answered),  Talent 25%, and Beauty (defined in writing as Face and Figure) 25%.  (In other words, the short, plump, less than pretty or less than “poised” whatever that means, and no matter how bright, need not apply.)<br><br>I asked what the objective was of the DepEd in organizing these pageants, and was told that it was for the promotion of Dumaguete as a city.  <br><br>Now that may make a lot of sense to some people but frankly, I was totally stumped. <br> <br>I tried again, and asked what <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">educational</span> objective the DepEd was pursuing in running these pageants, and got a baffled stare in reply.  <br><br>Raising the issue of these pageants is a yearly exercise for me, and if it tells us anything of sociological interest, it is that old habits, no matter how futile, ridiculous or backward,  are very resistant indeed to change.<br><br>And apparently, change on gender issues comes slowly to the DepEd who see nothing incongruous about displaying make-up slathered girls, and very young women (see their posters), basically for the sake of displaying them.  <br><br>This is more than a little strange when we think of all the government gender equality policies and programs, the text book changes to eliminate sex role  stereotypes, the so-called “values” education which presumably upholds the worth of the human person beyond superficialities.  <br><br>More ominously, “promoting the City”, if that’s what it’s about, by displaying girls sounds really bad,  let’s not even go there.  <br><br>It’s likely more innocent and mindless than that, a mere throwback to a time when people hadn’t heard the word “sexist”, when judging girls was considered acceptable entertainment,  when so-called “poise and personality” were apparently important! <br><br>But is it possible that the DepEd is unaware of the questionable messages it is sending out to young girls and to people in general?  If  so, the local DepEd needs re-educating on gender issues.<br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><br><br></html><br><br>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>Last week’s column talked about two small experimental islands (Sumilon and Apo) showing sustainable development of fisheries and biodiversity resources. Let us now consider scaling up these two cases to include larger marine areas. The idea is to enlarge our area of concern from small islands to larger islands and finally to the whole Philippine archipelago consisting of thousands of islands through our established political systems. <br><br>The community approaches of making our coastal areas recover their previous status five or six decades ago in terms of the diversity and biomass of  biological resources can be scaled up from the barangay/municipal scale, where our protected areas are at this point in time, to the provincial scale. <br><br>For a province to exercise direct roles in marine protection, it is not really necessary to have all the municipalities participate, only a majority of the coastal municipalities (and this is probably the reality today) is required for  a province-wide involvement in the setting up of marine protected areas consisting of coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass beds and other coastal systems. <br><br>Such involvement of the majority of coastal municipalities is a challenge to all governors to  show effective leadership in moving forward the development of their provinces in a step to provide a means to reduce poverty among coastal populations.<br><br>The impact of a province-wide coastal development would be significant, worthy of praise from all quarters especially from the press and would be a boost to the reputation of provincial governors. <br><br>This, of course, requires a monitoring system to show the actual benefits of marine protection and management. This close monitoring is lacking at this time. <br><br>The three-year term of governors and mayors is not enough to show increased fish catches because spillover in reserves do not occur until about a decade of protection, but three years are sufficient to demonstrate increased fish density and fish species richness in fully protected marine areas.  <br><br>The next level of action would be at the regional level under the Regional Development Council, which should coordinate the regional program on management networking of marine reserves. A coordinating mechanism will have to be worked out to deal with inter-regional relations. <br><br>Is this possible, given the conditions of the governance structure and dynamics at this time?<br><br>The overall impact of all regions on fisheries and biodiversity resources would be great at the scale of 10 years because spillover of larger adult fish, hence greater biomass, would be expected at this time  scale. This biomass spillover would show in the increased catches of fishers. <br><br>At the same time, it is possible that tourism will come in to increase the value and services of protected coastal ecosystems. At the present time, our coastal resources are mostly depleted that few tourist would be attracted to them.  <br><br>The scenario just described would happen only if our local government units will be united behind the call to establish no-take marine protected areas throughout the whole archipelago. If 30 percent of the total area  of Philippine coral reefs (ca 25,000 sq km), and some of our mangrove and seagrass areas are protected from fishing and from physical destruction, we will progress toward the restoration of the fish biomass on our coral reefs estimated at ca 100 to 150 tons per sq km in these protected areas instead of the five to 10 tons at the present time. <br><br>But most importantly, the areas outside of these protected areas will have high fish biomass from which we can be  assured of a constant supply of fish for our needs.  <br><br>And we can expect that every square kilometer or 100 hectares of reef would yield at least 15 tons of fish every year, instead of the very low couple of tons from our devastated and degraded coral reefs at this time.<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><br><br></html><br><br>",

They  remain  yesterday’s  bloodstains. <br><br>They   anchor  today’s  soft  but  firm  challenge  by  Nobel laureate  Aung San Suu Kyi.    “My  aim is for a peaceful revolution in Burma,” she told BBC, after  release from 15 years of detention  by Yangon’s  junta.<br><br>”A ‘velvet revolution”  sounds  a little strange in the context of the military,” she mused.

What are the odds? <br><br>Everywhere, militaries are more reluctant to repress demonstrators, says author Elena Poniatowska of Mexico. Not in  Burma. <br>  <br>In the “Saffron  Revolution”, the military <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">tatmadaw</span> slaughtered over  a  hundred, many of them monks,  Amnesty International  estimates. At least 74 disappeared. <br><br>Red Cross has been denied access to prisons since 2005.  “In the past two years, at least 238 political prisoners were moved to extremely remote prisons.

People Power 2  forced a  soused  and corrupt  Estrada regime to quit,  barely   halfway into  its six-year  term.<br><br>Did  People Power 3  occur   unrecognized?  That was when  popular sentiment, unlocked by Corazon Aquino’s death, thrust Benigno Aquino III into Malacanang,  some argue plausibly.<br><br>We hate to rain on our parade. But Filipinos did not invent People Power.<br><br>In  1930,  Mohandas  K. Ghandi  led  thousands of  Indians to protest  the Salt Tax. The “power of the powerless” proved  non-violent protests could  undermine repressive regimes. Ghandi  would often refer to Beatitudes that Christ  taught two millennia back. “Blessed are the peacemakers….”<br><br>Fast  forward to  post-Edsa  Czechoslovakia’s “Velvet Uprising” in 1989, compelled  communists to dismantle their single party state and allow free elections. Ukraine’s “Orange Revolution” of  2004  and  Georgia’s “Rose Rebellion” of  2005 protested vote-rigging. Both toppled pro-Soviet governments. Lebanon’s “Cedar Revolution” of  2005  drove out Syrian occupiers.<br><br>But not all People Power <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">golpes</span> have happily-ever-after  endings.  <br><br>Tanks rolled over  Tiannamen Square demonstrators, to the applause of Jose Maria Sison and other Filipino communists.

In his study <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Unarmed Insurrections</span>, Rutgers’ Kurt Schock tallied 31 major nonviolent rebellions in the Second and Third Worlds from 1978 to 2001.<br><br>Will  Burma’s  junta ride out  this trend?<br><br>Bunkered in Napyadaw, the xenophobic generals have zero sympathy quotients. Under them, Burma emerged second to Afghanistan as a source for heroin. Once  Southeast Asia’s “rice bowl,” the country today is the region largest producer of methamphetamines. Life expectancy is among the lowest in Asean.<br><br>But Ms Suu Kyi’s  hopes, like most of  ordinary  Burmese, runs headlong into stark  geopolitical realities. Burma’s coastline provides access to  the Strait of Malacca -- the key chokepoint in Asia.<br><br>“Daily, more than 12 million barrels in oil supertankers pass through this narrow passage, most en route to the world’s fastest-growing energy market, China or to Japan,” writes F William Engdahl  of  Center for Research on Globalization.   “Who controls those waters controls China’s energy supplies.” <br><br>There is oil and gas  in  Yadana and Yetagun. In 2004, a large new gas field, Shwe,  was discovered  off the Arakan coast.  China, Thailand, Japan. Malaysia, India and South Korea  scrambled over each other to snap up supplies that  Burmese generals peddle.<br><br>Burma  is an integral part of what China terms its “string of pearls,” bases from the Spratleys to  Cambodia. Beijing  funds construction of  a 2,300 kilometer pipeline from  Burma’s deepwater port at Sittwe in the Bay of Bengal to Kunming in China’s Yunnan Province.

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>Two contrasting columns, appearing side-by-side, in the issue of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">MetroPost</span> last Sunday, provided an insight into how University Town treats the sport of boxing on one hand, and on the other, the “8th Wonder of the World”, Congressman Dr. Emmanuel Dapidran Pacquiao, aka “Pacman” and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Pambansang Kamao.” </span><br><br>Dr. Pacquiao was bestowed an honorary degree of Doctor of Humanities by the Southwestern University in Cebu in Feb 18, 2009, and last August 26, 2010, he was a special guest of the Silliman University College of Law.<br><br>Coincidentally, in the Aug 22, 2010 issue of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">MetroPost</span>, a news item reported that SU is offering boxing in its Physical Education program. A picture accompanying the news item showed coeds fitted with boxing gloves. I think that SU holds the distinction of being the first academic institution in the Philippines to formally include women’s boxing in its PE program.  <br><br>Noting this development in our University Town, I wrote in this column, dated Sept 5, 2010, titled <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Women’s boxing trivia”</span> that “Cuba (which) has the best amateur boxing program in world…have announced that it will not field a women’s team in the 2012 Olympic Games because the sport is not appropriate for women…and that a leading sports official said that ‘Cuban women are made for beauty and not to take blows around the head’”. <br><br>Going back to the two columns in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">MetroPost</span>, one was titled <a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/enjoying-brutality-p728-102.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Enjoying brutality”</span></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span> by Cecilia Hofmann and the other, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/natl-budget-and-manny-pacquiao-p729-99.htm\">“2011 national budget and Manny Pacquiao”</a></span> by Atty. Whelma Siton-Yap.<br><br>Cecilia pointed out similar information which I have written about in my past columns in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">MetroPost</span>, about the need to ban boxing because “in boxing, the very intention is to physically overpower, to hurt, to incapacitate, and if possible to knock out or render the opponent unconscious” wrote Cecilia, or ‘to inflict corporal damage to the opponent...” is immoral, the Vatican proclaimed…”No sporting discipline nor any kind of ‘show’ can be accepted by a civic conscience if it endangers human life…Much worthier causes call for putting lives at stake,” the Vatican’s newspaper, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">the  L’Osseervatore Romano,</span> editorialized.<br><br>An an <a href=\"http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/11/23/10/docs-agree-dionisia-pacquiao-should-retire\">ABS-CBN report</a> dated Nov 23, 2010, Pacquio’s mother, “Mommy Dionisia has consistently been asking Pacquiao, to leave the sport while he is still healthy…Even Pacquiao's wife, Jinkee, is afraid that her husband will suffer the same fate that befell other boxers. Here are quotes from an interview with Jinkee: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"Si Manny after the fight, hindi mo mahawakan iyung ulo niya... namamaga… Kapag umiihi siya, parang kulay dugo. Hindi na yellow. Minsan, itim pa. Every time, after the fight, ganoon ang kulay, kapag umiihi siya. Kasi tinatamaan daw iyung kidney…’</span><br><br>Cecilia felt sad that a well-known columnist, in a “moment of (Pacquio’s) victory…heap on the adjectives and go delirious about feeling good to be alive, good to be Filipino, believe the Filipino can eradicate poverty…glorious, spectacular, magical (moment),” when to her, “it was merely sad, primitive, immature, violent, brutal.”<br><br>Whelma is a die-hard fan of Manny Pacquiao. This is apparent in her column in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">MetroPost</span> dated August 29, 2010, titled: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Del Carmen vs. Pacquiao.”</span> Wrote she: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Cong Emmanuel ‘Manny’ Pacquiao was a giant among the legal Eagles…His life story is inspiring and known the world over…But Manny is like a lawyer with his fists, bringing honor and glory to his country with each fight.” </span><br><br>In her column last Sunday, Whelma wrote: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“The 2011 National Budget was passed by Congress in record time so people started talking that there has to be a catch! Many surmised that the reason was the Pacquiao-Margarito fight; many congressmen were given free tickets to the ringside…indeed, watching Manny performing…transports us to the ringside, and we feel every punch, experience vicarious exhilaration, sharing reactions with many significant others… It gives us a feeling of community—being one as a people with the same hopes and dreams…”</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“However thrilled and jubilant the general population…are at every Manny Pacquiao victory, I belong to the camp that does not rejoice,”</span> asserts Cecilia. <br><br>In an email to me, Cecillia proposes that Foundation University organizes a forum to discuss the pros and cons of boxing. We will look into the merits of this proposal. One of those that we would certainly invite will be the DepEd people who support the inclusion of boxing in the Palarong Pambansa. <br><br>The British Medical Association and the American Medical Association strongly recommend the banning of both amateur and professional boxing for health and medical reasons. The AMA claims that children boxing as practiced in the Palaro is a form of child abuse. <br><br>Dr. George Lundberg, the editor of the Journal of AMA said: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“It is (child) abuse, pure and simple…It is predictable damage, and it involves children. And if adult promote, for their own pleasure, children bashing each other, hurting each other, then this makes a pretty good case for child abuse.”</span> <br><br>I hope DepEd Superintendents Profetiza Lim and Milagros Velez will take note of this.<br><br>I find the contrast in the treatment of boxing by Cecilia and Whelma in their respective columns an excellent opportunity for us in University Town to participate in an enlightened discussion of a sport that someone observed is an offshoot of the Filipinos love for the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sabung</span>.<br><br>So let’s have one in the form of a forum—without the violent ending for anyone or both of the contending sides. Will Cecilia and Whelma join me in organizing a forum on the topic: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Boxing should be banned in University Town.”</span><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><br><br></html><br><br>",

   "body": "<BR>Organic farming initiatives in Negros Oriental received a big boost with the signing of a partnership agreement by Foundation University and the Negros Island Sustainable Agriculture for Rural Development (NISARD) recently.{{more}}<BR><BR>The partnership was formalized during the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement between the two organizations last Nov. 19 at the Palm Court of the FU main campus.<BR><BR>Signing the agreement were Dr. Mira Sinco for Foundation University and Diodoro Olasiman, Nisard vice-president and managing trustee for Negros Oriental.<BR><BR>Signing as witnesses were Rep. George Arnaiz and Provincial Agriculturist Greg Paltinca. Mr. William Abay, NISARD administrator, was also on hand to witness the occasion and give a short speech.<BR><BR>Under the terms of the agreement, the NISARD will provide technical support to the organic farming initiatives of Foundation University and in return, the University will make available its farm in Tanjay City for experiments on organic farming.<BR><BR>It can be recalled that the Rep. George Arnaiz, then as governor of Negros Oriental, was a signatory to the document, along with then Negros Occidental Gov. Joseph Maranon and President Gloria M. Arroyo, creating  the NISARD in 2004.<BR><BR>Negros Oriental, Arnaiz recalled, had been experimenting on organic agriculture in 2001.  Now, we are happy to note that Foundation University is also into organic farming and that we have struck a partnership with the first university to go into organic farming, Arnaiz added.<BR><BR>Foundation University, on the other hand, traces the beginnings of its organic farming methods to the year 2002, when the University of the Philippines at Los Banos gave then FU President Leandro Sinco 12 worms as his prize for being selected as an outstanding UPLB alumnus, which he used to make compost fertilizer in the University’s farms in Amlan and Tanjay City.<BR><BR>Now, the worms have multiplied thousands of times over and the University makes its own compost fertilizer for its own use.<BR><BR>“Our farms are the first in Central Visayas that can be considered as 100 percent organically operated,” Dr. Sinco said.<BR><BR>But, Sinco noted, doing organic farming back then was like dancing by one’s self. “We always felt the the need for someone to share our advocacy, someone who could share our pursuit of something that is good in the field of agriculture,” she said.<BR><BR>Sinco also reminded everyone that organic farming should be done in support of the Millennium Development goals of food sustainability and the eradication of hunger and poverty.<BR><BR>“Foundation University for the past four years has proposed a radical view that the key to rice and food sustainability is not efficient production but the creation of a culture of conservation,” she said.<BR><BR>After the MOA signing, Rep. Arnaiz inspected the Bio Mechanical Goat (BMG)project of FU. BMGs are garbage digesters that dramatically shorten the decomposition time of organic waste into compost in a mere 21 days.<BR><BR>Arnaiz was impressed with the simple technology that the University adopted from Engr. Tito Nemenzo, the original designer, and ordered the mass production of BMGs for distribution to urban areas in his district. <BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

The police officers were justified in making the in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">flagrante delicto</span> arrest of Flores.  <br><br>\"In their presence, Flores had actually committed an offense.  To constitute a valid in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">flagrante delicto</span> arrest under paragraph (a), Section 5, Rule 113, the following requisites must concur:  (1) the person to be arrested must commit an overt act indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (2) such overt act is done in the presence of or within the view of the arresting officer.  These requisites have been satisfactorily complied with.  In drug cases, an arrest made in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">flagrante delicto</span> does not require that the arresting officers possess expert knowledge of the substance seized, or that they perform precise scientific tests to determine its exact nature.\"<br><br>\"The defense of Flores was predicated on bare denial, nothing more.  Considering the testimonies and evidence of the prosecution, the denial of the accused failed.  Denial is considered as an inherently weak defense, for it can easily be concocted and is a common standard line of defense in drug cases.  Flores also failed to adduce clear and convincing evidence to overturn the presumption that the arresting officers regularly performed their duties.  Flores failed to show by any satisfactory degree of proof that the police officers were impelled by ill-motives to testify again him.  Stated otherwise, the presumption of innocence accorded the accused had been overturned by the evidence presented by the prosecution.  The prosecution has convincingly proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime charged.\"<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><br><br></html><br><br>",

All my practice runs were always several kilometers short,” she confessed.<br><br>Running mostly alone, Irma said she paced herself by following some faster runners. “It was good that the organizers had several water stations along the way as I didn’t bring any bottle to lighten my weight,” she said.<br><br>She said there were times during the quarter marathon when she wasn’t sure she had enough energy to get to the finish.  But memories of her victory in the recent Buglasan Duathlon (run 3K-bike 26K-run) Fun Bike category kept her going.<br><br>“The conditions, of the bike are also a factor,” continued Cobbie.  “Nearing Balili [in Valencia], the rain began to fall and the course which turns steep downhill felt like we were navigating over margarine while trying to avoid rocks and trees; there is a lot of praying that goes on.”<br><br>At the end of the day, these three Silliman faculty lifted up trophies of honor. “May our small feats be an inspiration to the spirit of excellence and competence that all Sillimanians adhere to everyday of our lives,” Cobbie remarked. <br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Related stories:</span><br><a href=\"index151.htm\">Dumaguete gets the running bug</a><br><br><br>        <a href=\"index262.htm\">Dumaguete Adventure Marathon pictures</a><br><br><br>        <a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index238.htm\">Dumaguete Adventure Marathon results</a><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

According to Jesus, those who take their faith for granted are those who merely hear the word of God but never truly put them to practice.  <br><br>In the book <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">No Place for Truth</span>, theologian David Wells talks about the “theological vacuum” present in many churches today.  According to him, it is because of this theological vacuum that, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Many church worship services have become one huge entertainment, and what is being offered is a therapeutic gospel.”   </span><br><br>What he meant by therapeutic gospel is the propagation of a kind of faith that no longer confronts people of the reality of genuine repentance and righteousness, but instead promotes a self-serving, feel-good and prosperity-focused brand of Christian discipleship.  <br><br>You see, Jesus clearly points us to us that at the end of the day, we can never fool God.  He sees the deepest attitude of our hearts, and he perceives every hidden and secret motive of our hearts.  <br><br>What truly draws the line at the end of the day is not just about hearing the Word of God, but allowing the word of God to transform us deeply as we follow the ways of God. <br><br>Jesus reminds us that those who truly, deeply, and sincerely put God’s Word into the practice are the one’s who are truly wise in the eyes of God.  <br><br>It is important to remind ourselves always that wisdom and intelligence are not the same.  Intelligence has something to do with acquiring information and knowing fact but wisdom is about the conduct of our lives before God and others. <br><br>The Hebrew word for wisdom is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">hokmah</span>.  It is related to a root meaning “correct skill” or “care” and came to imply “right skill in living.”  It is our ability to pursue what is righteous before the Lord and beneficial to others. <br><br>Sadly, the world we are living in is obsessed with intelligence but not wisdom.  As a result of this neglect for true wisdom, the world has become tolerant and undiscerning of many philosophies and world-views that are emerging in recent times.  <br><br>In September this year,  a book was published titled <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Grand Design</span> by Stephen Hawking (with Leonard Mlodinow), one of the most respected physicists in our time.  <br><br>He argues in his book that God did not create the universe. Hawking says that given the existence of gravity, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“the universe can and will create itself from nothing.”  </span><br><br>Apostle Paul, in his letter to a very intelligent-conscious and progressive-thinking group of Christians wrote, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“<sup>18</sup>For the message of the cross of Jesus is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. <sup>19</sup>For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.” Corinthians 1:18-20 (New International Version)</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br>Jesus is reminding us that it is not easy to pursue genuine wisdom of God in a world that continues to reject him.  <br><br>Jesus then begins strengthen his point by teaching about two builders who built their respective houses.  One built his house on sand, but one built his house on the rock.  <br><br>Seemingly, everything went on normally and quite well for these two houses until one day when  the rains came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew. The house built by the fool collapsed, but the one built by the wise withstood the storm.  <br><br>In the final analysis, it is not just the outward and external trimmings in life that really matter. It is the foundation of our lives that will be the most important consideration at the end of the day.  <br><br>Jesus argues further that in this world, the strongest and most durable foundation is not wealth, or power, or achievements, but only Christ and his word. <br><br>We may have all the money in the world, the greatest profession, and even the most powerful friends, but if we build our lives on the fleeting things of this world, we will crash, sooner or later, just as Jesus himself warned.  <br><br>There are two things that God wants to leave in or hearts today as we put this message to a close: <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">          <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Discernment</span><br></div><br><br>        We should not believe everything we hear and agree with everything we see in this world.  Discernment then is our ability to draw the line between what is right or wrong -- not according to what we feel or not according to the opinions of people but according to the precepts and standards of God’s Word.   <br><br>One cannot be wise apart from the Scriptures.  As a mother of two young children, I often imagine how the world will be 20 or 30 years from now.  At the rate things are going, we parents cannot afford to be lax. We need to prepare our children for the battles ahead.  <br><br>These battles are not physical.  They are spiritual.  These are the battles our children need to fight against philosophies, teachings, and world-views that are anti-Christ and anti-Scriptures.   <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">         <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Decision  </span><br></div><br><br>        Decision, in the context of the message today, is making a conscious, deliberate, and intentional choice to hold on to Jesus Christ and his Word when rains come, the streams rise, and the winds blow, and beat against us.  <br><br>Decision is the choice we make to align with the Lord and believe in our hearts that these storms are just passing by.  <br><br>God have mercy on us!  Surely, we can never stop the violent storms from ravaging our lives, but one thing we can do: to be immovable in our faith that as we stand firm on Jesus Christ and his Word, we will make it through -- someway and somehow.<br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><br><br></html><br><br>",

The biggest group were members of the FU community-- 3,511 of them -- who ran mostly the 3k and 5k route.<br><br>One hundred thirty-three runners came from all over the country to run the 31.5k three-quarter marathon. <br><br>Last year’s winner, Jeson Agravante, 22, of Silay City, was among the first to register.

Kristoffel Kiamco who came from Samar. <br><br>Also in this group were middle-aged professionals -- doctors, lawyers, and teachers.<br><br>Seventy-six runners joined the 5k Finishers’ Run, and another 45 joined the 3k run. Also running the 3k were children with disabilities from the Great Physician Rehab, who ran with their parents or relatives.<br><br>A very visible person during the race was Dr. Aparicio Mequi, former chairman of the Philippine Sports Commission, who now chairs the FU Institute of Youth Sports for Peace (IYSPeace). “I’m just here as a watcher because I have turned over the organization of this race to FU people. And I’m happy to see that they’re doing good. I must have been a good teacher,” he chuckled.<br><br>Even for a seasoned organizer like Mequi, it was gratifying to see everything fall into place, especially as the support from the various sponsors started to pour in. <br><br>One big problem was soliciting rice for prizes. <br><br>The Dumaguete Adventure Marathon, in keeping with its rice conservation advocacy in partnership with PhilRice, only gives out rice as prizes, and are not convertible to cash, except for those from faraway places. <br><br>For the Dumaguete Adventure Marathon and the succeeding event -- the Rice is Life Cookfest -- a total of 90 cavans of rice were needed. But as of Oct. 28, there were only 16 cavans in stock. <br><br>Mequi sounded the alarm, and called on every member of the FU community to help in raising the needed amount of rice.  By race day, a total of 130 cavans had been collected.<br><br>A total of 14 towns and cities had also signed up for the cookfest that was held at the Al Fresco section of the Robinson’s Dumaguete Mall starting at 8 a.m. They all showed off their skills in preparing dishes with rice as the main ingredient.<br><br>“It was the grandest show that we, at Foundation University, ever staged in concert and in unison with other sectors in Negros Oriental,” Dr. Mequi said in an email to all the organizers, paying tribute to all the unsung heroes who made the race a reality.<br><br>The effect of all those efforts even had Mayor Sagarbarria raising his thumb in approval. “The Dumaguete Adventure Marathon will surely put Dumaguete City in the tourism map,” he said, saying that the event adds to the variety of attractions that Dumaguete City has to offer.<br><br>But perhaps by far the biggest compliment the DAM got was from a seasoned runner who came all the way from Manila to run the race.

   "body": "<BR><BR>I have been fortunate to visit many countries of the world for educational and scientific purposes. In most of these trips abroad, my hosts provided opportunities to see more of their countries by bringing us to tourism areas. <BR><BR>For my part, sight-seeing in a foreign land is so relaxing that I often felt refreshed after going through serious scientific discussions during formal meetings.  <BR><BR>To me, learning to appreciate other people and their countries is part of our international education. The visits to their tourist sites are more than sufficient to compensate for the often laborious preparations needed for attendance at scientific and educational meetings held abroad.<BR><BR>Almost always, our foreign hosts would take us to their famous cultural sites that show significant aspects of their history and culture, and their tourist sites that depict the uniqueness of their environments. <BR><BR>Practically all of our guides to these sites have been very good at explaining the importance of these sites. From our observations, it was quite clear that these countries have exercised great care in preserving the uniqueness of their cultural and tourism sites. And my impression has been that they have provided sufficient budgets to maintain these sites.<BR><BR>I find that the foregoing observations from foreign countries are hardly true in the Philippines. Take for example the recent controversy about the new logo made by the Department of Tourism (DOT). <BR><BR>The controversy was overblown by the press. The press should have focused more on the essentials of keeping the country beautiful so that foreign tourists would be attracted to the Philippines, rather than focus on the supposed error of DOT officials. It should have considered issues such as whether our natural tourism sites are kept in good condition or in good health.<BR><BR>So I am asking the question, what matters most in tourism? <BR><BR>My own experience shows that it is the tourists themselves who determine whether they are going to pay good money for certain tourism sites or not. Many tourists come to the Philippines to enjoy landscapes and seascapes not common to them in their countries. <BR><BR>In Negros Oriental, for example, marine ecosystems and tropical rainforests are tourist attractions for their natural beauty. In fact, it was the tourists who decided that Apo Island and the coral reefs of Dauin town should be tourist destinations, not the local people, and not even the tourism officials of Negros Oriental. The people, of course, are the beneficiaries of tourism.<BR><BR>But the reason why these areas have attracted tourists is because the marine ecosystems have been kept attractive to tourism through protection. <BR><BR>What I am saying is that a potential tourism site should first be protected as a natural site before it becomes attractive to tourists.  <BR><BR>Many sites in Negros Oriental are potential tourism sites but unless they are protected and maintained in good condition, they will not develop into popular tourism destinations. This is a simple statement but many local government officials do not really understand it.<BR><BR>I give Dumaguete City as an example. The City government has not realized until now that many people come to Dumaguete to snorkel or dive in coral reefs that have good live (not dead) coral cover and plenty of fish, and the only way to maintain the beauty of these reefs and the adjoining beaches is to protect and manage them. If this is not done, no divers will come and pay good money as user fees.<BR><BR>Another example I would like to mention is Lake Balinsasayao (by the way, this is the spelling used in earlier publications on this lake). Our effort should be focused on keeping the original forest around the lake intact, and advertise the area as the only mountain near Dumaguete with original tropical rainforest in Negros Oriental. <BR><BR>Many of the new generations of Filipinos have no idea of what a rainforest is all about. This is our chance to educate them on the values of this natural heritage. So let us use our resources to protect this last remnant of rainforest that is within easy reach of people, including tourists. <BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Doesn’t  that  fit  President Benigno  Aquino III’s waffling on the Freedom of Information bill? He oscillated from  fervid “cross-my-heart”  support  to  “aw-shucks”  back  pedaling.<br> <br>In contrast, Corazon and Benigno Aquino Jr.  stood, without  ifs and buts, for transparency in government. Did it ever occur to P-Noy that his waffling smudges the “draw-the-line-in-the-sand” stance his parents took?  <br><br>Recall the 14th  Congress’ closing day... Prospero Nograles (Davao) and Pedro Romualdo (Camiguin) led  pro-Arroyo  congressmen in  that hoary swindle dubbed “slaughter by roll call”.  <br><br>Only 128 House members showed up  -- seven short of the 135 needed merely to ratify an FOI  committee report, already approved by the Senate and Lower House... Some congressmen  were  discreetly  shooed away. All the Arroyos, were “no-shows”: Diosdado M., Ignacio T., Maria Lourdes,  and Juan Miguel.<br><br>So did congressmen who whitewashed the World Bank road bidding scandal: Reps. Elpidio Bragaza and Roger Mercado. Malacanang allies Jesus Crispin Remulla, Pastor Alcover, Jovito Palparan vanished.<br><br>“In doing so, they built another “firewall” for the anticipated -- now coming to pass -- exposes of sleaze against their patron: Gloria Macapagal Arroyo,” <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Viewpoint</span> noted then. “They fractured the Constitutional directive for transparency.”  The FOI bill would have implemented  that  mandate.  <br><br>The day after the Lower House “massacre”,  the  President pledged to fast track FOI in the current Congress. Thus, Rep. Lorenzo “Erin” Tanada (4th District, Quezon) predicted early approval of a re-introduced measure. That’d make FOI the “very first legacy”of the 15th Congress under the Aquino III administration,”  Tanada  declared. <br><br>An FOI would give citizens “access to official records, documents and papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decision.” That’d cover the politically volatile area of tax money.  <br><br>In addition, government research data, used as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen, subject to limitations provided by law.  <br><br>An FOI is not new. Sweden put  the first  FOI ever, on its law books, in 1766. The  opposition had been denied financial data on the party in power’s spending. (Sounds familiar?)  <br><br>Since then, 85 countries have adopted FOIs of varying effectivity.<br><br>“Interminable delays and stonewalling in requests for information led the US to write an FOI law in 1966  (amended in 1974). South Africa adopted an FOI after apartheid’s collapse.<br><br>“All indicate a fundamental shift in governance that recognizes the ownership by people of government information,” notes <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Comparative Media Law Journal</span>.  These occurred   before WikiLeaks. <br><br>But  “fortune has a fickle heart and a short memory,” the Chinese proverb warns. <br><br>In his first State of the Nation address, PNoy  didn’t spare a line about retrieving the gutted FOI measure.<br><br>“Many of us are puzzled. This (is) an uncharacteristic omission by the President,”fretted <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Inquirer</span> columnist Cielito Habito.  “No one beyond P-Noy’s innermost circle seems to know the real reason for the omission. One can only hope it’s not an ominous sign that enemies of transparency are gaining some headway in the new leadership.”<br><br>Well, “man does not live by bread alone, although he sometimes must  swallow them,“ the late Adlai Stevenson  once said.  <br><br>PNoy’s underlings swallowed piecemeal  his grand pledges on the FOI.    <br><br>In a four-page statement  to the House public information committee, Presidential Communications Operations Office head Herminio Coloma Jr., without blinking,  “expressed concern that some provisions of the FOI bill may hinder or endanger government operations.”<br><br> “There’s  a need to balance the broader right advocated by the bills with ensuring that government operations will not be paralyzed by gratuitous requests for information,” he said. <br><br>Provisions granted access to information that  government decision-makers or project managers currently use.  Offices could be  swamped by an overload of  requests for  access to information. <br><br>Malacañang belatedly discovered that the Constitution spells out “very limited instances where the President is given the privilege of certifying a bill as urgent, as in calamities, presidential spokeswoman Abigail Valte  scrambled to added. “That’s another reason for the (President‘s) decision not to certify the bill as urgent.”<br><br>What is the polite word for B.S.? Bovine ordure, constitutionalist  Joaquin Bernas suggested. He was  describing, if I recall right, Bicol gerrymandering to accommodate  GMA’s son. <br><br>Look at how the US Freedom of  Information Act has operated. It processes about two million requests a year. More than half  deal with veterans tracing documents. About five percent came from media.<br><br>Cory Aquino dismantled the Marcos  censorship machine and smashed padlocks on the papers and broadcast stations.  “The media’s power is frail,” she said from bitter experience.  “Without the people’s support, it can be shut off with the ease of turning a light switch.”<br><br> At  the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Inquirer</span>’s 25th anniversary meet, PNoy   recalled that his  father lived by the belief. He quoted Ninoy:   “A free media is indispensable  if a democracy is to function efficiently, if it is to be real. The people, who are sovereign, must be adequately informed all the time.”<br><br>PNoy  can always plead  loss of memory, of  course.  After all, “the pendulum of the mind alternates between sense and nonsense, not between right and wrong.” <br><br>But  for PNoy to spurn  his parents’ sterling legacy  is  -- what’s the polite word for  dung?<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>It was an amazing four-day conference that took place in St. Petersburg, Russia last week, where representatives of 13 countries, including five prime ministers, met to agree on five-year programs and measures and US$330 million in funds to save one animal,  the tiger. <BR><BR>That such high-level attention should be paid to saving the tiger is testimony not only to the special place many cultures accord the tiger for its beauty, power and symbolic values invested in it.  It also manifests an understanding of the responsibility human beings must take for their behavior, too often damaging,  towards other living creatures. <BR><BR>Only 3200 tigers are left in those 13 countries, from a population of about 100,000 a hundred years ago.  <BR><BR>Human beings have crowded them out of their historic habitats, leaving them only seven percent of the areas where they formerly roamed and lived.  Along with habitat loss, poaching and illegal trade continue to diminish their numbers.<BR><BR>The fierce and majestic beauty of tigers commands attention,  and certain other  animals like whales or dolphins or elephants find campaigners to work for their protection.  <BR><BR>Just a few days ago, a news clip showed turtles being protectively watched as they made their way safely into the sea in Morong, Bataan, and of course, there’s the Philippine eagle that is given special status and hopefully looked after. <BR><BR>There are some “stars” in the animal world,  it would seem from our attitudes and behavior, among the general population,  there’s much less concern about other living creatures.  <BR><BR>Irresponsible consumption by too large human populations has led to the loss or serious decline of fish stocks such as cod and tuna.  <BR><BR>In my own  neighborhood, boys will still shoot bats or the few lovely blue birds left, for the fun of the hunt and to eat them.  <BR><BR>Food is the great excuse for much animal cruelty,  as  is  sport.  But sheer animal cruelty can take shocking form as in an incident told of a local politician aspiring to high office who in a rage, tied to a vehicle and dragged a “trespassing” cow to its death.   <BR><BR>Neglect probably characterizes the usual behavior towards the ordinary domestic animal.  I found my dog over a year ago in a canal, a flea-ridden puppy whose skeletal mother was tied with three feet of rope to a dirty shed.  <BR><BR>When I walk her today,  we still see many dogs whose entire lives are lived within the area allowed by three feet of rope. <BR><BR>A lawyer friend in Cebu works with an animal welfare outfit that can be contacted at helpiro@yahoo.com  and that does animal rights education and litigation, if necessary, to apply existing national law, and to move people towards more enlightened and respectful attitudes and behavior with regards to our fellow living creatures. It would seem that we could use such an outfit in this province.<BR><BR>At least the tiger may be assured of protection,  even the World Bank has a “Global Tiger Initiative.”   One of the targets set at the recent St. Petersburg international forum is to double the number of tigers by 2022.  <BR><BR>Looking at the pictures accompanying the news reports makes one realize again that every single tiger is more magnificently beautiful than most human beings and that their space on this earth must be assured.<BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Not personally, of course, but professionally. Before he rose to prominence as convenor of the Black and White Movement, he was already a high-profile consultant and speaker in the local IT scene. You might say I know him well from his many brochures and email invitations to his events. Later on, Mr. Romano turned his energies to political advocacy and, well, zoom! For that he had my respect.<br><br>I didn’t expect to hear more of Mr. Romano, so his resignation last week came as Department of Tourism undersecretary came as a surprise: I didn’t even know he had been appointed to the position.<br><br>In a way, it’s sad. Mr. Romano resigned because of the flap over the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pilipinas kay Ganda</span> campaign. Mr. Romano chose the honorable way out. He owned up to the error, even though his name hardly came up in the furor. One would hope that his exit would provide closure to the issue, but since the real target seems to be Sec. Lim, it seems this will grab the scorn and the limelight for a few weeks more.<br><br>The irony is this: now that Mr. Romano has resigned, people are more sure that he was a decent, responsible man, unlike other officials who cling to their posts come hell or high water. Perhaps he shouldn’t have resigned? Too late, folks.<br><br>Now, I’m not a fan of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pilipinas  kay Ganda</span> campaign, but only in the same way that I wasn’t a fan of “Wow Philippines” campaign, which is to say, I’m apathetic. Both are messages crafted for tourists. I should care why? Some people will prefer one, some people the other, but really, it it an issue of such grave importance that it should make the headlines? For more than a week? Is it so profound that it demands the resignation of an undersecretary?<br><br>If these are the national issues that plague the Aquino administration now, well, they must be doing something right. If, as the straw man for our Burning Unquenchable Rage Against All Things that Offend Us, we have to pick on such trivialities, hooray! Because I tell you I would rather have issues like this than, say, issues on the scale of NBN-ZTE scam or an Ampatuan massacre.<br><br>Except: I’d rather not. There are more important matters to act on, even to get upset about. Take for instance, the wrongful death of Leonardo Co: the murder of the Philippines’ top botanist is something we should get mad about, right? However, I doubt it gathered the same kind of reaction that “Pilipinas Kay Ganda” got, much less the gleefully hateful response to Mai Mislang’s tactless Tweets.<br><br>Priorities, people.<br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Balana which I shall quote here for the benefit of those who missed it: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">World boxing sensation Manny Pacquiao should consider permanently hanging up his gloves after 57 fights and eight world titles as the brain can only take so much battering, according to medical experts who treat head and brain injuries from boxing. “If he wants to reduce the risk of further brain injury, I would categorically advise him to stop because the longer he stays in that kind of competitive level, the more blows he will receive to the head and it accumulates,” said Dr. Asis Encarnacion, president of the Academy of Filipino Neurosurgeons. “It is said that the force of a punch from a professional boxer is like getting hit with a 16-pound bowling ball travelling at 32 km per hour.”  Unlike football where players experience head-on collisions, the blows to the head of the boxer are usually rotational , the doctor explained at a health forum “Lethal Blows, Lethal Injuries – Boxing!” sponsored by the Philippine College of Physicians.  “When the head is abruptly rotated, sometimes the veins which bridge the brain to the skull get torn.  This produces what we call subdural hematoma (bleeding). In the acute phase, a boxer usually gets hit on the tangential area of the face which causes the head to actually rotate and the brain to bounce.  Encarnacion said that repetitive brain jarring could also lead to a diffuse axonal injury, one of the most common and devastating types of traumatic brain injury.  In this kind of brain injury, neurons lose connection with other neurons in the brain, a condition similar to a short circuit in the wiring of a computer.  The possible  long term effect could be chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a disease similar to Alzheimer’s.  Once diagnosed, the average lifespan would be 18 years from diagnosis.  Based on scientific data 80% of professional boxers have a chronic brain problem which manifests in the form of abnormal behavior, dementia or even Parkinson’s disease.  Dr. Bimbo Diaz, a neuropsychiatrist from the Philippine Psychiatrists Association, said of all sports, boxing is the most destructive to the brain.  He said there is a move in the American Academy of Neurology to ban the sport.</span><br><br>There is a growing trend to get children into boxing. I have seen some of these tykes training at the oval near the Capitol.  <br><br>Think hard (if you can still think if you are a boxer) before you agree to send your children to boxing training.  It is a dangerous path to tread.  There are other martial arts that can instill discipline and mastery without incurring brain damage.  <br><br>What I would like to see more of are courses in<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> self defense</span> for all ages considering the environment we are in where there is theft,  murder, the Bloods and Crips, etc.  Self defense should be taught in all schools.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Esther C.

Gus, the elder, had been having problems remembering what cards were what, and usually needed help from his wife. At the end of the card game, Red says to Gus, “You did very good tonight. You didn’t need any help at all. Why is that?” Gus replies, “Why, ever since my wife sent me to that memory school, I haven’t had any problems at all.” “Memory school? What memory school?” Gus thought for a moment, “Oh, what’s that flower that’s red with thorns? A really pretty flower. “A rose?”asked Red. “Yeah, that’s it!” Gus turns to his wife, and mumbles, “Hey, Rose! What’s the name of that memory school you sent me to?”</span><br><br>I came to Dumaguete in 2005 and in five days, I will be marking my fifth year in this place that I have grown to love and call “home.” <br><br>Proof of that love, I think, is the effort I have devoted to get children and youth involved in sports, and to actively participate in vigorous activities for their health, wellness, and formation. <br><br>With the assistance of friends from the MetroDumaguete Roadrunners Club, PE teachers, coaches, and staff of the FU Institute of Youth Sports for Peace (IYSPeace) that I helped established on July 7, 2007, and with the support and encouragement of FU President Mira Sinco and son, Dean, faculty, staff and students, I had made Dumaguetenos “become athletic” -- in the words of a friend in Manila. <br><br>The year 2010 is most memorable for me. With the theme <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Wellness Generation, Apil Tanan</span>, we succeeded in convincing many people in this University Town to take up walking as a form of exercise to combat obesity—and the potential health hazards that being “the country’s  Motorcycle Capital” could inflict on residents of this City of Gentle People. <br><br>Riding on vehicles, instead of using one’s legs, makes one prone to a sedentary lifestyle, and susceptible to osteoporosis of the bones of the legs. This is the finding of recent researches.<br><br>For this piece, I would like to share interesting and valuable information about the effects of walking as a form of exercise to the aging brain of seniors. I hope that through this column, I can encourage the senior citizens of Dumaguete to join the Quarter Marathon for Wellness Challenge I have organized in tandem with the management of Robinsons Dumaguete. <br><br>This walk covers a distance of 10.5 kilometers which, if completed, will convince those who successfully walk the distance to make walking as a regular form of exercise.<br><br>A article by Martin Wainwright (guardian.co.uk, Oct. 13, 2010) titled <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/oct/13/walking-could-protect-brain-against-shrinking\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Walking could protect brain against shrinking</span></a><span style=\"font-style: italic;\"></span>, US research says reported that American neurologists who monitored 300 volunteers for 13 years claim in a paper published in Neurology, the online medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, that “walking may protect the brain against shrinking and preserve memory in the elderly.”<br><br>The article cites the cases of historian George Macaulay Trevelyan who wrote in 1913 that he had two doctors: “My left leg and my right,” and legendary perambulators Alfred Wainwright, Benny Rothman, and the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Guardian</span>’s Harry Griffin, “who lived for a combined total of 268 years thanks, in their own estimation, to lives spent largely on foot and outdoors.” The research cited appears to show that the simple act of putting one foot in front of the other is a potential defense against dementia and Alzheimer’s.<br><br>The researchers started monitoring the subjects in 1995, dementia-free people in Pittsburgh, who agreed to log their walks. Nine years later, followed by further testing in 2008, showed that those who walked the most, about nine miles ( 14.5 kilometers) per week—considered the “optimum distance for ‘neurological exercise’ -- cut their risk of developing memory problems by half. The first round of scans showed that nine-mile walkers had larger brains than those who walked around for less. After a further four years, 116 volunteers – 40 percent of the sample – had developed some dementia or cognitive impairment, with the effects 50 percent greater on those who walked only short distances and on non-walkers.” <br><br>The optimum neurological distance of 14.5 kilometers can be covered by going around Robinsons Mall four times, five days a week. <br><br>As one ages, the brain shrinks and walking my help prevent or minimize this sign of aging and maintain thinking functions. This mild exercise reduces the risk of other diseases and conditions that can affect the flow of blood to the brain such as diabetes, heart diseases, and stroke. Walking increases the blood flow to the brain, while decreasing blood pressure, and may stimulate brain activity in seeing new sites, meeting, chatting, and socializing with other walkers, or just experiencing the joy and exuberance of being outdoors. Daily walking can be the best prescription of health as one qualifies for a senior citizen discount card.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

It appeared after a rain shower, and split the sky into light and dark, rain and sunshine. While it lasted, it was really quite spectacular. <BR><BR>A lot of people went out to look at it; but mostly they were just waiting for their movies to start-- and after a few minutes, the only people left were  those you see here. Only the two boys on the right are actually looking at the rainbow. They looked at it for quite a while. Maybe they didn’t have the money for the movie.<BR><BR>Or maybe they are still young enough to see the rainbow as a sign of hope; the shining image of a bright fantastic future to pursue as they grow older; the future which will recede before them year by year, and finally fade.<BR><BR>Like the rainbow. Gray grandmothers cluck disapprovingly at these  fantasies. “Chasing rainbows” is a sign of irresponsibility in the young, time wasted in pursuit of things they cannot hold or keep. For the lolas, rainbows are only a sign that hard rain is over for awhile.<BR><BR>However that may be, rainbows are still beautiful—like sunsets and clouds and breaking waves. And like these things, they are democratic; you can’t buy them. They look no better from a Mercedes Benz than they do from a fisherman’s hut by the beach. <BR><BR>Still, when the rainbow fades, it’s better to have the Mercedes. Rainbows are ephemeral. The world changes around them while they shine, But<BR>they can’t be predicted, and they never last for long. <BR><BR>This particular rainbow is seen through the cold glass windows and aluminum frames of a modern commercial mall, a huge heavy structure of concrete and steel and tile, dedicated to selling various kinds of  things and services for cash. <BR><BR>But not totally dedicated. For example, the terrace these boys are standing on is not strictly necessary for sales; it’s just a  graceful gesture by the architect toward the view outside the blank walls. And the rainbow has modified and brightened that view for a moment.<BR><BR>It has attracted the attention of these two boys, and focused their feelings  a little beyond expensive objects of desire. In everything that surrounds them, it’s the only thing that’s not for sale. <BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport12-5.jpg\"><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR><BR>",

There had been growing reports of teenaged boys or young men lurking in the dark, wearing black shirts or shirts with the symbol of the skull printed on them. And there often were reports of violence between groups. There must have been several gangs roaming the City streets back then but two names stood out--the Bloods and the Crips. <BR><BR>Authorities have tried to downplay the existence of these groups as mere \"copycats\" of the Bloods and Crips gangs in the United States. By the \"copycat\" tag, perhaps the intention was to influence them to opt out of their romantic adventure. But with each new violent incident came the realization that copycat or not, the violence they inflict against each other is as real as night and day. <BR><BR>Last month, a resident of Pamplona town by the name of Jelo Rosales was shot in the head at the Quezon Park. This was in addition to the fatal shooting of another gang member, Marlon Hurquiza, one week earlier. Both victims were said to be members of gangs and both were believed to have died because of gang-related violence.<BR><BR>City Police Department came up with a controversial list in 2007. The list contained names of gang members in Dumaguete. The list, which included sons of prominent politicians, caused the gangmembers' fathers to get angry. It would come as no surprise if the rumor that the fathers of the gang members caused the transfer of the chief of police back then, was true.<BR><BR>These gangs may have had spurious beginnings but now, they appear to have become bigger and bolder. They have become a reality that the City has to deal with. <BR><BR>Knowing the enemy is winning half the war. The authorities already have a list of members of these two groups. It could work to improve on this list and get to the bottom of this problem.<BR><BR>We do not profess to know how to eliminate street gangs. But the City has all the resources at its disposal. It has the psychologists, social workers and most of all, it has the police. Let us see how effective the authorities can be in dealing with this growing menace.<BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Many times, addressing the effects of climate change  only needs some common sense.{{more}}<BR><BR>A panel of judges led by internationally-renowned scientist Dr. Angel C. Alcala chose three ideas submitted by college students as practical and replicable household solutions to climate change.<BR><BR>The winning entries were a rainwater conditioning and processing unit, the practice of natural pig raising and the idea of painting roofs white.<BR><BR>Friday’s contest at Silliman University was joined by students from Silliman, University of San Carlos in Cebu,  and Central Philippine University in Iloilo City, and was funded by the World Bank and Smart Communications.<BR><BR>Students from USC presented the proposal for natural pig raising and for painting roofs white. Natural pig raising, they said, is more environment-friendly when done the natural way as against the commercial way because it would need mostly indigenous materials and waste products, saves electricity and water and, among other things, reduces flatulence and belching in pigs.<BR><BR>The idea of painting roofs white, attributed to U.S. Energy Sec. Steven Chu, will make houses cooler than if painted with dark colors. The USC group proposed that because the color white absorbs less heat than dark colors,   homes with white-colored roofs tend to use lesser electricity for air-conditioning.<BR><BR>The idea of collecting rainwater and processing them into drinking water was an idea presented by the students from CPU. Rain, they said, is one of the biggest sources of water that is hardly utilized for drinking. Making drinking water out of rain will reduce a household’s dependence on commercial potable water.<BR><BR>The ideas, which could be implemented for less than P15,000, were judged on their scientific soundness as well as the ease of replicating them in other households.<BR><BR>This exercise, Alcala said, is long overdue. “The important thing that has emerged is that the young people are challenged to respond to climate change. We have got to know the science behind all these changes.”<BR><BR>    He expressed hope that the students who joined the contest will be inspired to strengthen their science backgrounds.<BR><BR>The two other judges were World Bank Partnerships focal person Henry Grageda and Nova Concepcion from Smart Communications.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA -- It was a day to remember.  To be exact it was 13th of November, Y2K10.  At Cowboys Stadium in Texas,  Manny and Margarito battled toe-to-toe for the WBC Super-Welterweight Boxing Title.  When standing toe-to-toe, Margarito got the edge on a 6-inch reach-and-height advantage aside from being 17-lb heavier than Manny on fight night.  The size disparity begged for comparison to the David-and- Goliath mortal combat for God and country, 2K10 ago.  Just like David, Manny intoned in his theme song <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fighting Pride</span> to the beat of war drums “Deliver me from this fight to honor You and  country”.  Just like Goliath, Margarito fought for personal glory and redemption of Mexican boxers who suffered defeats from Pacquiao, the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Mex-Executioner.</span>  Just like David and Goliath, Manny and Margarito were out in the arena championing a cause.<br><br>It was a boxing event to remember.  It was the day when Manny annexed the eighth wonder of the boxing world.  No boxing great had ever done it before, not even the greatest Muhammad Ali in annexing 8 championship titles in 8 different weight divisions from flyweight (112 lbs) to super welterweight (catch-weight - 151 lbs).  For Filipinos it was a watching experience worth remembering.  Millions of Filipinos glued on the pay-per-view TV worldwide in 24 different time zones made the event border-less and timeless.  The Filipino race got animated as Manny bewildered the bigger and stronger opponent with hand speed and nimble feet.  They felt Manny’s every move.  They rejoiced in having a smaller version of Ali floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee as their countryman took control in Round 4 after measuring his hitting distance.  They got stuck in suspended animation when Margarito managed to pin Manny on the ropes in Round 6 and buckled up for a fleeting second when he got hit with a left cross on his rib cage.  They waited with bated breath as Manny did a rope-a-dope, they exulted when Manny tagged Margarito back with 1-2-3 > 5 combinations.  <br><br>Every move Manny made in the ring gave a sense of nationhood to millions of Filipinos scattered all over the World.  Without thinking, just feeling the Pacquiao phenomenon.  They appreciated and loved Manny more in the last three rounds when he cast a glance to referee Laurence Cole to check on Margarito’s swollen eyes.  He said later on that boxing is not about killing each other to explain his change of heart of knocking out Margarito.  He showed that even in a brutal sports like boxing one can still choose to turn his fists of fury into fists of mercy as he carried Margarito as a brother in the remaining rounds.<br><br>Pacman is the man to remember.  Here in Australia, Bobby Cabanag of the Sydney Chapter Silliman University Alumni Association remembered him by posting on Facebook the Pacquiao Classics a day after the Manny-Margarito fight.  Bobby emblazoned the video with a caption in bold letters <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pacquiao for President</span>.  An official of the SU Sydney Chapter Alice Dumlao asked Bobby whether he was serious in his call for a Pacquiao presidency.  I chimed in why not?  As Pacquiao is using his talent for God and country, the gem of SU’s pursuit for excellence and a character trait we find wanting in our well-educated and intelligent leaders.<br><br>Everybody now seems to be getting into the act of honoring the action hero.  Sarangani accorded a hero’s welcome to their Congressman last Friday.  A general wants Pacquiao to be a peace negotiator with Muslim separatists in Mindanao.  Senators want him to be the country’s tourism poster boy.   President Noy warms up to the idea.  Philippine Star Chair Wrecker William Esposo presents unwittingly a great potential to the Pacman as the tourism poster boy.  With the furor raised over the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kay Ganda, Pilipinas</span> slogan, Esposo came out with a slogan idea from his friend “Philippines:  where Asia wears a smile.”<br><br>No other Filipino smile is seen by the whole World as Manny smiles when he ambles the lane on his way to climb the boxing ring prior to a fight.   Asked by a 60 Minutes Interviewer on the meaning of that smile.   Manny replied, “That’s me.”  That smile reflects the high happiness index of the Filipino people, a great come-on for tourists to visit the Philippines. Asked on his interest to run as President, my action hero replied, “That’s too far yet to talk about.”  Manny is qualified to run for the highest position of the land by Y2K22.  In the meantime, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pakyaw</span> is focused on being an effective public servant as an Honorable Representative of the people of Sarangani.<br><br>Manny Pacquiao is purpose-driven of the spiritual kind.  Maybe it is not hard after all for Filipinos to contemplate on a smiling President by the Y2K22.   So far in boxing,  he has bewildered the strong.  Maybe, just maybe God may be using him to confuse the political heavyweights come May Y2K22.  Such is the mystery of the Pacquiao Phenomenon.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

This is definitely the most powerful and most profound message of the Advent season. From generation to generation, God with Us remains to be the most immovable, non-negotiable and unbending truth we proclaim as followers of Jesus today.  In our scripture reading today,  we are invited to look into Matthew’s account of the birth of Christ.  Matthew directly quotes an important prophecy written by Isaiah,  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and you will call him Immanuel. </span>(Isaiah 7:14)   <br><br>Going back to the time of Isaiah in the Old testament, thousands of years before Jesus Christ was born, we remember that nation of Assyria. The Assyrians were a proud and brutal people whose styles of warfare were sophisticated and savage.  The Assyrians loved to burn alive their captured enemies.  Part of their warfare was to severe the heads of their enemies or skin them alive.  The bloody military sieges waged by Assyria left nations in great fear including the nation of Judah, under King Ahaz.  And so, for the sake of survival, King ahaz found himself making dangerous alliances with Assyria despite the warnings of God through prophet Isaiah.   <br><br>You see friends, like King Ahaz, many people today, for the sake of survival, will forge dangerous alliances with evil and wicked forces.  They are so coward in standing up for what is right that they end up giving themselves on a silver platter to what is not of God.  Some would call this “practicality”  or merely the natural instinct of survival, but in the eyes of the Lord, these ways can lead us to ruin and destruction.  Many times over, God sent Isaiah to remind King Ahaz not to put his confidence in Assyria but only in the Lord but King Ahaz was too coward and too spineless to stand for God.  At one specific point, through prophet Isaiah, God’s words of promise through a prophecy were spoken to the King, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and you will call him Immanuel.”</span><br><br>Immanuel is a Hebrew name which means God with us.    These words of prophecy about a child who will be born and will be named Immanuel (meaning God with us)  were spoken by Isaiah in order for King Ahaz to turn to God in the midst of the political turmoil.  But unfortunately, King Ahaz remained stubborn and failed to rise up in a new level of faith that God wanted to see in him as the leader of his nation.   Instead, he continued to put his confidence in the nation of Assyria for the political and economic survival of Judah.  Consequently, he made serious spiritual compromises along the way, the worst of it was when he destroyed the altar of the Lord and built a new altar in honor of the gods of Assyria.  At one point, he even sacrificed the life of his own son to appease the Assyrian gods.   What does it mean for us Christians today to celebrate the message of Immanuel, God with us?<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">            <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Courage</span><br></div><br><br>        God With Us is a call to courage.  My two children, Khaki and Red, when asked to do a task they find big and intimidating like going inside a room full of strangers or approaching a friend to ask for forgiveness they will instinctively turn to me and my husband and say, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Samahan mo ako.”</span>  And each and every time, we find ourselves obliging and experiencing later on the joy of seeing our children succeed.  For us parents, being there for our children during the difficult seasons of their lives is simply non-negotiable.   And on the part of our children, once they see us, their parents--- once they hear our assurance, our support and unconditional presence--- the very moment they know that we are with them, a glorious thing happens.  Our children rise up in their spirits and do what they never imagined they could accomplish.<br><br>King Ahaz knew that his nation could never stand a chance before Assyria.  They were powerless and they needed to survive at all cost.  But here was the still small voice of God telling King Ahaz, through prophet Isaiah, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“I am with you.  I am with you.”</span>  <br><br>Just like the experience of  King Ahaz, there comes a point in our lives when we need to choose between what our physical eyes see and what God wants us to believe.  That’s what courage is all about.  Courage is not merely being reckless or fearless. Courage is our ability to align ourselves with God and trust him absolutely, totally and wholeheartedly.  <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">    <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Christ centeredness</span><br></div><br><br>        God With Us is a call to Christ-centeredness.  As followers of Christ, we are always reminded of one sure and basic truth -- that the  entirety of God’s character is in the very being and identity of Jesus Christ, Son of the Living God—Savior and Lord.    Therefore, for us who believe, Jesus Christ is not merely an anointed prophet, a miracle worker or is he just a teacher equal to anyone who has ever lived or will ever live.  Scripture says that Jesus is God with Us.  The very fullness of God is in Jesus Christ.  <br><br>As we welcome the Season of Advent--- let us all be reminded that because God is with us through Jesus Christ, we can be courageous in facing all the uncertainties of the future.  In the midst of the many voices in this world contending for our loyalty and devotion---- may we be careful and wise in our choice.  There is Only One True God ---- and anyone who believes in him will never perish but have life eternal.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

In the 1990s, they did, in spades—but later found a gold mine in fluff. Commerce will always triumph artistry in the spoiled landscape of ABS-CBN’s universe. But sometimes, there comes fluff that succeeds despite itself, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">despite</span> the formula. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">My Amnesia Girl</span> happens to be one of those lucky few.<br><br>While a claim has to be made that this has to be the cheesiest film ever put into production, and apparently by design—something about it makes it works marvelously. Is it its surprisingly deft juggling act of comic zing and romantic earnestness? Or the fact that it unapologetically wears its heart on its proverbial sleeve, but does it with a dose of warm and earthly charm that shield us from the cringe-worthy assortments of its many fairy tale segments? <br><br>What seems important is that our enjoyment is earned. In the theater I was in, I could feel the pulsating energy of the people responding to it in fits of laughter and cycles of Kleenex-muffled tears. (When Noel Cabangon’s rendition of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Di Na Natuto</span> came in midway through the film, it proved to be the final straw. The sniffles became epidemic.) I was right there along with them, having surrendered easily to the film’s conceit: a young woman pretends to have an amnesia as she deals with the return of the man who has jilted her at the altar. <br><br>Before its release, the film drew instant comparisons to Peter Segal’s 50 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">First Dates</span> [2004] and Jae-Young Kwak’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">My Sassy Girl</span> [2001]—but it surprises us by finally not being a rip-off of either, and instead charges its way to our hearts with its heedless deluge of cinematic confectionary. I cannot say, however, that is completely original: you see traces of “inspiration” culled from beloved movies past, including the ones mentioned earlier and then some—like the string-on-finger sequence from Chris Columbus’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Stepmom</span> [1998]. Nor is it unpredictable: I could guess the kind of ending it would come to from miles away. (Then again, the films from Star Cinema from the last decade or so have never been known for their good endings.) <br><br>Still we are forgiving of its borrowings in particular because it does so in a fresh way that redeems the act and elevates the final product to new light. We are also actually delighted by the sugar rush it induces. Why is that? For the most part, it helps that the characters are ably played by actors with such undeniable depth. Ms. Gonzaga has a quirky likability to her that makes her roster of movie roles shine with a note of the plausible, even when she seems to go all-out for the cutesy all of the time; her impeccable comic timing, however, is what draws us in. And she has her little moments, too—those telling shifts in acting tones that are subtle, difficult to achieve, and easily ruined by sheer lack of talent. (Take note of the derisive laughter that greeted Kris Aquino’s frightened face in the trailer for <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dalaw</span>.) <br><br>But it is Mr. Cruz who commands our attention. What can be said about an actor who basically plays an asshole—but makes us root for him nonetheless? Already the unlikely matinee idol of contemporary Filipino cinema, he can do no wrong these days: he has a seasoned thespian’s gravity and star power that reminds me of Meryl Streep, but it is a power that he wields by not drowning out and outshining the efforts of the others around him; instead, he reinforces the ensemble effort in scenes that call for it. Consider for example the fact that the chorus of supporting characters that surrounds Mr. Cruz is still indelible in our immediate memories of the film—particularly the comic antics of Joross Gamboa and JM de Guzman, both of whom were revelations. <br><br>What I cannot forgive, however, is the uneven command that Ms. Molina has for the technical aspects of this otherwise winning film, considering the tremendous resources that must be at her disposal as her studio’s primary directorial talent. The film simply does not look polished, even from the first frame when the Star Cinema logo comes out. The cinematography is awful, the editing is blah. <br><br>What finally saves it is the acting, and the nimble screenplay by Carmi Raymundo, Jade Castro, and Miguel Sevilla who do the fantastic job of concentrating all the cheesy kilig love jokes ever made—and make them work without straining our patience and our anti-diabetic buffers.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>Christmas and New Year holidays are around the corner, and we’re all looking forward to them, not only exchanging gifts, but more importantly the sharing of a special meal with family, friends and relatives.  The scrumptious food and delicacies that we prepare for these celebrations are the very centerpiece of them.  They symbolize togetherness, celebration, and  thanks for all the blessings that we receive throughout the year, and they help us to welcome the coming year with a positive outlook.  <BR><BR>Baked ham is one of the most common foods in the menu, and then there are the special imported canned foods such as corned beef, spam, Vienna sausage, pork and beans, etc., as well as imported chocolates to cleanse our palate after the meal.  But not to be outdone by the imports, our special native delicacies are also part of the whole celebration, including hot bibingka (a big deal in some provinces especially after evening masses), leche flan, hot chocolate, and puto. Let me not forget the lechon, the star of the occasion because it simply is delicious.  A variety of noodles and pasta dishes are often included as a symbol of long life, as well as other traditional family specialities that are often prepared solely for these special occasions. <BR><BR>Well, I don’t want to spoil everyone’s appetites for all these delectable items, but let me just share some reminders and tips to keep in mind in the midst of all this indulgence.  After all, we are celebrating the goodness of our lives, and eating healthy foods will make our lives better and longer, so that we have more holidays to enjoy.  First, even if we’re eating things that are so delicious (and therefore, in most cases, unhealthy to some degree), we can still be mindful of our health by eating appropriate portions. And we can try and get a couple of forkfuls of veggies into our mouths along with all the good stuff.<BR><BR>While I’m not a dietitian, I want to put in a word for salads, which unfortunately are somewhat rare on the Filipino plate.  They’re refreshing, good for the digestion and for your health generally, and they can be delicious.  For example, steamed baguio beans cooled and tossed with nuts; add some diced apples or diced pears or small pieces of tangerines, then just add oil and vinegar with salt and pepper (depending on your taste) as your dressing. Or you can just julienne some raw cabbage, carrots and singkamas, add diced semi-ripe mango, and dress it with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper and minced ginger, and you get a very nice tasty salad, especially if you let it sit for a couple of hours before eating to help break down the raw cabbage a bit.<BR><BR>Exchanging gifts is great fun, but nothing can top the senses of our taste buds, which are known to induce happy thoughts, and if we add some brains into the mix, we can make sure we stick around for next year’s feasts and many more to come.  Happy eating and good health, everyone!<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>PRISAA stands for Private Schools Athletic Association. It was organized on Feb 17, 1953 through the initiative of Dr. Manuel Carreon, Director of the Bureau of Private Schools. It was incorporated under SEC Registration No. AN093-000539 forty years later, on Feb 2, 1993 with the following incorporators, each contributing P100: Emmanuel Angeles, former CHED Chairman during the latter years of the Gloria Macapagal Arroyo administration; Anthony Nicanor, a Philippine Sports Commissioner during the time of incorporation; the late Athletics Director of National University, Leticia “Mommy” Paguia; Felicitas Francisco, PE Director of the University of Santo Tomas; and a Jose Laureles, who is identified in the internet as an official of the Jose S. Enverga Foundation University in Lucena City. <br><br>Last Nov 20, Foundation University President, Dr. Mira D. Sinco, sent the letter quoted below to Mr. Ryan Aznar of Southwestern University in Cebu, who is coordinating PRISAA events in Region 7. A copy of the letter was furnished to Fr. Vic Uy, of the Holy Name University in Bohol, former PSC commissioner, and current President of PRISAA region 7. The letter remained unanswered to this date, triggering the move on the part of FU to boycott the national PRISAA games,  renamed “National Collegiate Games or C-Games” by Angeles, scheduled in Feb next year at the Rizal Sports Complex in Manila.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dear Mr. Aznar,</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Foundation University has been a long time member of the PRISAA and as I recall, when the 13th National PRISAA was held in Dumaguete City in 1966, my late husband, Leandro G. Sinco, was elected Chairman of the National Board of Trustees. Having said this, I trust that you will understand and appreciate the motive behind my raising certain questions pertaining to recent developments in this athletic league. These queries may be stated as follows:</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">1. I am made to understand that the PRISAA is now affiliated with an organization called Federation of Higher Education Associations, which according to the website of the Philippine Sports Commission, had requested for funding support in the amount of P5 million to finance the holding of the National Collegiate Games, a request which the PSC denied. Is the National Collegiate Games the National PRISAA?</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">2. I am also made to understand that the FHEI is composed of Regional Associations of Higher Education Institutions (RAHEI) of which Region 7 is a member. What are the RAHEI and FHEI? Are they in the same category as, say, the PACU, to which Foundation University and I presume other PRISAA members, are likewise affiliated with?</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">3. What is the juridical personality of the FHEI and the RAHEI? Are they SEC registered? If so, who are the national officers of the former? I also understand that the supposed election of officers of Region 7 RAHEI was postponed indefinitely due to the untimely demise of the mother of the National Chairman of the PRISAA/FHEI?</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">4. Is there an official and legal tie-up between the Region 7 PRISAA and the RAHEI? If so, when and how was this relationship forged?</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">5. I am also made to understand that the CHED has authorized the collection of P100 from each student last February to finance the cultural and academic competitions of the PRISAA, however, since this additional fee was not subjected to public hearing, we cannot impose the fee this school year. However, in a letter dated November 18, 2010, addressed to Presidents of PRISAA Member Schools, you indicated that we are being “assessed P15,000.00 per school as participation fee for Athletic and Academic event.” Since we intend to participate only in the “Athletic” events, are we required to pay the fee of P15,000.00?</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I would appreciate a clarification of the questions I raised above so that any subsequent moves we undertake to insure our legitimate participation in the forthcoming PRISAA competitions is done with the best of intentions and without any cloud of doubt. Today, I have authorized the participation of our basketball, volleyball and sepak takraw teams in the eliminations to select the representatives of Negros Oriental to the Regional PRISAA which you will be hosting in Cebu. I hope that in telling you this, I am assuring you and other members in Region 7 of Foundation University’s intention to continue to be part of the PRISAA.</span><br><br>On Nov 22, we received a letter from Aznar informing us that he endorsed our letter to Fr. Uy as he “is the best person who can clarify your query no. 1 to 4 more accurately than I do.” As I indicated above, Fr. Vic Uy has not provided the answers to the questions that Dr. Sinco raised.<br><br>Wanting to test the validity of our planned boycott and to muster support from other PRISAA members, I texted UNIGAMES president, Roger Banzuela of De La Salle University-Bacolod, and was I in for a pleasant surprise!  I emailed him a copy of Dr. Sinco’s letter and the following are some of his text messages to me: (a) “Ok. I’ll help you. I’ll start contacting ang mga kilala ko sa ibang Region;” (b) “I distributed your letter and suggested to boycott the Feb C-Games, or send only 1 player kung ayaw nilang magboycott. On Thursday, I’ll be in Manila and I’ll give copies to my friends from Southern Tagalog;” (c) “Can I publish sa local daily dito sa Bacolod the FU decision to boycott the C-Games of Angeles para marami makabasa?;” (d) “On the 19th, magkita kami ni Richie (PSC Chairman) and I’ll explain to him everything;” and many more text messages conveying support and encouraging information regarding shared discontent and need for reforms in the PRISAA. <br><br>There are many issues to be raised regarding the management of the PRISAA in addition to those cited in Dr. Sinco’s letter: (a) election of national officials where Angeles has been President/Chairman since 1990; (b) current SEC status; (c) financial report on funding support received from the PSC and the private sector (for example-P1.5 million from PSC and P1 million from Manny Pangilinan for the national PRISAA held in Naga City last year); and (d) an intriguing partylist whose candidates include Angeles’ son, Gabriel Martin L. Angeles, President and CEO of the Angeles University Foundation Medical Center,  in the last elections garnering 25,211 with an interesting acronym: 1st PRISA which stands for “First People’s Representative for Indigent Student Athletes.” Is there a sinister plan of Angeles to use the PRISAA to establish a political base for this partylist?<br><br>The PRISAA is one of the oldest sports leagues in the country which includes in its program both basic and tertiary level competition. Member institutions levy on its student population P100 per semester to finance participation. Schools with enrollment in the tens of thousands stand to collect millions of pesos. Thus, the potential of PRISAA to promote sports participation among the youth must be safeguarded against any attempt to utilize the league for ones personal agenda.<br><br>We call on other member institutions in our University Town to join FU in this campaign to institute reforms in the PRISAA. Other members in other parts of our country are joining us. We look forward to the administration of Silliman University, Saint Paul University Dumaguete, NORSU and ACSAT to be one with FU.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The woman on the right, beside the overturned bicycle, is mindlessly watching a stream of sand drop through her hand into a  pile at her feet. Her face is empty of  any feeling. <BR><BR>Only the boy standing in the center seems active. His face is twisted into his hands in pain. He seems to be weeping, perhaps overcome by some private sorrow. No one is paying attention to him, and no one cares. <BR><BR>And behind all of them hangs what seems to be a vertical curtain of water, poised to crash down and wash them all away.

Unlike reality, it has no color and  is cut off inside a frame. The camera froze only a brief, isolated moment of the scene. And since I don’t remember being there, that moment is not even a memory. <BR><BR>The only reality that remains is this picture, the photograph itself.

Extra-curricular activities of students have traditionally dealt with practical training in areas of governance and politics through the organization of student governments. This could have sharpened the students’ desire to become politicians or to place a premium on political positions as a way of rendering public service.  But I suggest that universities consider other ways of using student extra-curricular interests to the solution of important, urgent issues, such as those relating to climate change.<BR>   <BR> One significant action program on university campuses in the Visayas has been initiated jointly by The World Bank and SMART Communications. It supports student projects that address climate change in three universities in the Visayas, Silliman University, University of San Carlos and Central Philippine University under the leadership of Mark Garcia. The project challenges college students to propose innovative, feasible and replicable interventions that can be implemented in local communities requiring little financial support as their responses to the projected or the already occurring impacts of climate change. These interventions should be student projects without faculty involvement in the conceptualization and planning phases.<BR><BR>    The student project proposals should be a refection of how the faculty members of a university have taught their students about the impending environmental crisis, which is climate change. Climate change as a curricular subject is probably not taught in most Philippine universities today, but certainly the subject is well discussed in various natural and social science subjects as well as in scientific meetings involving the research faculty.<BR><BR>Students who are well read should have a certain amount of understanding of the science behind climate change, which is essential in fully grasping the primary and secondary effects of climate change. They should be knowledgeable about climate change, a subject that is being talked and written about in the media and in many publications, scientific and popular. <BR><BR>There should, therefore, be no excuse for ignorance about climate change, whether one is a student or teacher in a university. The implication of not knowing what the impacts of climate change are should be obvious, considering that the bulk of the Filipino people know very little about it, as our initial survey indicates. One of our responsibilities as part of the educated people of this country is to make the phenomenon of climate change understood by people in all walks of life.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Looking up information in the web in preparation for a tree-planting activity in Amlan last Sunday, I came upon the XXIII  IUFRO (International Union of Forest Research Organizations) World Congress with the theme “Forests for the Future” held last August in Seoul. Who knew there were 15,000 scientists, and 700 member organizations in 110 countries working on such issues as tree chemistry, forest genetic resources, forest health and climate change, and 150 related research topics?  Comforting information, in these days of threatening environmental disasters,  to know so many at work on vitally important matters. <br><br>It put me in mind of my days in the international conference circuit, the heady sense of community with the most diverse people pursuing the same goals. Or rather, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> mostly</span> of like mind, for there were also the activists and lobbyists (on human rights or women’s health or gender-based violence, migration, human trafficking and prostitution) with acutely adversarial positions, and sometimes conference excitement included being nearly killed (along with my group) by a large angry mob in Dhaka,  Bangladesh.  (Digression to comply with editor’s  suggestion  to get personal…)<br><br>But surely tree and forest researchers and scientists are a more peaceful lot,  and among the mostly technical Congress themes and research presentations, one stood out that confirms what  many of us knew in our hearts: trees make us healthier. How nice to be vindicated amid taunts that tree defenders are foolish and impractical romantics, objecting to widened cemented streets, tree branches lopped off, cemented parking areas, new buildings one next to the other.  (DPWH, City Engineering and Noreco take note.)  “Preserving green areas and trees in cities is very important to help people recover from stress, maintain health and cure diseases.  There is also monetary value in improving people’s working ability and reducing health care costs,” said Dr. Eeva Karjalainen of the Finnish Forest Research Institute, the coordinator on the health benefits of forests and green areas at the World Congress.   A green environment can lower blood pressure, boost immunity and disease fighting cells.  In another site, mention was made of surgery patients who could see a grove of deciduous trees recuperating faster and requiring less pain-killing medicines than matched patients who viewed only a brick wall.  Trees promoting healing!  A potential therefore for decreased health care spending. <br><br>Worryingly,  Dumaguete City has steadily been going in the opposite direction in its pursuit of urban “progress”.  Instead of preserving trees or increasing their number,  very many have been cut or seriously damaged.  Today the “heat island” effect (temperatures higher than the surrounding more rural areas) of the inner city is clearly felt as streets and buildings absorb solar radiation and then radiate it back.  The result is not only discomfort but real stresses to the human organism.  Trees obviously have the great potential for mitigating the “heat island “ effect  in addition to all the known benefits of  shielding people from the sun’s rays, reducing air and noise pollution, all of which have negative health impacts.  To a small extent,  local government  is making concessions to environment groups’ calls to re-green the city.  But what is needed is a more massive program.  Planting trees is entirely do-able and must be done for the health of the population.  We always knew that trees and green areas could uplift the spirits and simply make us feel good,  now scientists tell us that there is evidence about the healing effects of trees and nature.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Miriam Santiago puts it. Their succession of faux pas and gaffes bears out the charge: careless tweets, unimaginative campaigns, and backstepping all around.<br><br>Really, what do you expect a government that’s run by consensus? And when it all comes down to it, isn’t that what we wanted in the first place? Consensus? Participation? Collegiality? When you have to take everybody’s opinion into account, you end up with no opinion. When everyone has to have a say on where to go, you end up going nowhere.<br><br>A lightweight administration? Indeed! But only because it chooses to pander to a lightweight constituency. What’s that old saw? We get the government we deserve.<br><br>Like the Obama administration in the US, the Aquino administration is a product of the Twitter generation. Their campaigns did not just run in the streets, they happened in cyberspace as well. And in the aftermath, you have an administration and cabinet with their own Facebook pages.<br><br>How apt. Nowhere else can we distill democracy into its purest form than with Facebook and Twitter. Agree with what I have to say? Like! Re-Tweet! See, you don’t even need a COMELEC anymore: you can gauge the popularity of an opinion by the number of times it was repeated.<br><br>Disagree with what I have to say? Sadly, there’s no Unlike button yet, or an Untweet. But hey, who needs that when you can set up a Facebook hate page. Then you just get your friends to sign up and then you roll out the vitriol. Fight fire with fire, baby!<br><br>So there you have it, democracy in its purest form: mob rule. Scream and shout until you get what you want because, after all, whoever shouts the loudest wins. Where are the voices of reason? Shouted down, I’m afraid. Ignored, because, you know, they just weren’t hip enough to be on Facebook.<br><br>In fact, opinion has now come to be counted as news. Mainstream media routinely reports that such-and-such has become a Twitter trending topic. Facebook comments from vetching joes and janes apparently now have the same weight as presidents, cabinet members, and congressmen. If you doubt this, just tune in to any broadcast “news” program: you can’t go five minutes without some host proclaiming “Over at Facebook, people are saying....”<br><br>Listening to others’ opinions, sharing your own -- these aren’t of themselves meant to bad things. But we cannot expect to act on each and every opinion. Therein lies the way to madness, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">because you just can’t please everyone</span>. Opinion has to lead to understanding of the other’s position, not necessarily surrendering your own.<br><br>I have more respect for a person or an institution that knows how to draw a line and say, “This is what I stand for. This is what I am. This is what’s right. This is what I believe in. I respect you, but I will not compromise with you,” rather than someone who erases and redraws that line at every hint of opposition.<br><br>And certainly, I have more respect for a person or an institution that translates their credo into action. Opinions are just words, after all. You can’t make a revolution based on Facebook, you actually have to go out there and act (just like you can’t feed anyone based on Farmville, you actually have to go out there and plant.)<br><br>Maybe it’s time to stop using Facebook and Twitters as means of governance, exciting and high-tech as that might sound. In the end, Likes and Tweets are all just a bunch of hot air, a clanging cymbal, loud yet devoid of meaning. <br><br>As Pope Benedict said in an address: “New technologies and the progress they bring can make it impossible to distinguish truth from illusion and can lead to confusion between reality and virtual reality. The image can also become independent from reality, it can give birth to a virtual word, with various consequences -- above all the risk of indifference towards real life.”<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

He was ‘insulted and incensed” that his control over his barangay was apparently challenged. <BR><BR>The publicity of the Maguidanao massacre  of 58 souls, thirty three of them, journalists, highlighted the problem  of  armed militias. It is misleading to  denote these armed groups as “private’, because more often than not, they involved active/ retired military and police elements, elective or appointive officials.<BR><BR>Thus, the term, “untouchable”, is  attributed to the fact that  in the ordinary course of  events, these local officials who control these armed groups, are  also  responsible for the appointment to local judges, prosecutors, and any other vital government positions in the area. Hence, they are well connected, and they can pull the strings, if needed, thwarting any attempt at  prosecuting criminal acts of these armed groups.<BR><BR> If the Ampatuans could kill 58 persons in broad daylight, and bury them along the roadside, in November 2009, who else have they killed or buried? And why did it go this far, in this modern day and age?  What ever happened to crime and punishment?<BR><BR>Such is the effect of  absence of the rule of  law, and disregard of public duty as a public trust. This is a big challenge for the State- the government of the Republic of the Philippines, as there are many “Ampatuan clones”,  in various areas of the country. They  can emerge in any locality, if its residents are not vigilant. No one should be above the law or should anyone be “untouchable!”<BR><BR>It is the State that investigates, prevents , prosecutes and punishes crimes, because it has the monopoly of governmental powers and public force. The fact should not be lost that it is injury to the public which criminal action which seeks  to redress, by such redress  to prevent its repetition, and it is not injury to individuals. The private offended party is a witness for the State. And if elements of the State are actors of the criminal act- the result is anarchy. <BR><BR>Thus, the problem of “AMPATUAN CLONES”, should be addressed by the State, and through vigilance, the citizenry should endeavor to nip in the bud the emergence of these personalities in their locality. <BR><BR>Let us not allow armed groups to operate with impunity in our province!<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

As a consequence of this ‘error’, the SU trustees seek to correct this matter by assimilating all facets of Silliman University ‘Church’ into the University, and addressing Church policy in a Silliman University Church Operations Manual.<br><br>If the SU Church is not a legal entity and able to develop by-laws for Church operations, is it a Church in fact, legally or otherwise?<br><br>If SU Church is not a Church, how can it continue to perform the offices of a church; i.e. conduct marriages, collect offerings, and other authorizations that are within the legal auspices of a church?<br><br>Do the Articles of Incorporation of Silliman University authorize the University to operate a Church? Is the intent to diminish the SU Church to the status of a chaplaincy of Silliman University? Does a chaplaincy have the authority to collect offerings, perform marriages, and function as a Local Church? <br><br>The intent of the early administrators of Silliman University was for the Church to minister primarily to the student body.  However, over the years, the Church has evolved into being primarily a place of worship for alumni and the community with less than 10 percent of the student body attending services at the SU Church, although chaplaincy services are extended to the occupants of campus dormitories.<br><br>From the aspect of a relatively recent observer of SU Church, I suspect that the SU Church (UCCP) adopted by-laws of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines which were then tailored to meet the specific needs of the Silliman community, and thereby, assumed a legal identity under the Articles of Incorporation of the UCCP. <br><br>This assumption is reinforced by the past practice of many years of the SU Church’s financial contributions of support to UCCP.  Resuming this relationship and maintaining an autonomous personality in cooperation with the University would resolve aforementioned foreseeable difficulties/questions of attempting to assimilate the SU Church into Silliman University.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Jack J.

All these full body searches, or pat downs, passengers have to go through at U.S. airports have most passengers protesting the latest security measures by the Department of Homeland Security to ensure the safety of Americans. Many Filipino-Americans have been subjected to these searches and if you are among the few who have not tried what many would call a humiliating experience, read an account of a Dumaguete native (who prefers to remain anonymous for obvious reasons) to have a vicarious experience of how being patted down feels like -- editor.</span><br><br>TEXAS -- I don’t know if any of you has had to travel lately.  Well hopefully none of you experienced what I did.  <br><br>I did travel over the weekend and  what started as a  nice trip turned out to be a not so pleasant trip.  I don’t know if all of you are familiar with full body scanners.  Well these are scanning devices that allow airport security to see underneath your clothes.    Obviously these are for security reasons  the need for which was heightened by that “underwear bomber”  incident almost a year ago today.    When I first heard about this almost two years ago,  I was initially for it.     Better to lose one’s privacy than   to get blown up  into a million pieces.   <br><br>Several months ago ,  I have began reading articles about how these things might increase the chances of cancer.  This changed my opinion on these machines a bit to the point where I told myself maybe this is not such a good idea.<br><br>So coming home to Dallas,   I was just so “fortunate” to get  picked out to “have my picture taken”   so to speak.  I don’t know why I have the luck that I have.    I don’t win lotteries but I get picked for things like this.   Like several years ago,    when I get picked to a jury from a pool of  750 people.    Do I just look unique ?   I have more incidents like this but that is a story for another time.<br><br>Anyway,  you have the option to turn down a full body scan.  In exchange you are get a “body  pat down”.    Sounds so innocent right ?   Right !!!!   anyway I was brought to a private area by a male TSA agent to do the “body pat down”.   I cannot describe in detail what happened in there,  (since this is a family oriented forum) but I can tell you, the term pat down  is a gross understatement of what happened.<br><br>After the “pat down”  I didn’t know whether to get angry or  give the guy my number.     After what he did,  we probably should be dating na. I mean,  he now knows more about me than my doctor will ever will.    By coincidence I am seeing my doctor next week,   and I was thinking if he asks me  how I  feel,    I should tell him,  ask the TSA agent he knows exactly how I feel.   He felt me up for like an   eternity.<br><br>Anyway,  am not a prude or anything but,   somehow,  being  so defenseless like that, not a good feeling.  Makes me wonder though,  are job applications increasing at the TSA from the ‘third’ gender?  Just wondering.<br><br>With my luck,   I may get another jury summons  soon, and  I know exactly what happens when I get there.<br><br>But you all don’t have to worry.  For most of you, in fact for all of you, if you travel soon,   it will most likely be just  that old reliable metal detector when you go through the airport. Me, I am just lucky.<br><br>But the funny (I don’t actually mean funny)  thing about this though,  is if faced with the same situation in the future,  I am not sure what to prefer--hanging or firing squad?     <br><br>I’ll just take Greyhound next time.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Name Withheld</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>For the first time in the history of ABC Elections in Dumaguete City where the thirty (30) Barangay Executives who were elected last October 25, 2010, conducted their ABC Election of officers free from any political vendetta. <BR><BR>Well, history would tell us that in the past of the conduct of the same activity, there had been lobbying beforehand as to who will be the ABC president, to the extent of buying votes with considerable financial backup coming from political cadlers. <BR><BR>This time was entirely different.  It was a “History in the making”, quoting from the recently elected ABC Vice President Leonel Banogon.  The “Liga ng mga Barangay Kapitan” were given a free hand to do the elections on their own.  There were totally no political interventions.  During the conduct of elections, the Hon. Manuel T. Sagarbarria was in Manila for official business. Cong. George P. Arnaiz, Second District Representative was also out of town.  Hon. Albert Aquino elected ABC president disclosed that what they only spent that day was their fare from home to the city session hall where they conducted the said election and their fare back home.  They spent nothing more, nothing less. “Mahimo raman diay,” Bert Aquino says.<BR><BR>The said ABC Election of Officers was conducted on Tuesday, December 7, 2010 at exactly 10:00 o’clock in the morning and participated by all thirty (30) Barangay Captains.  The conduct of elections was spearheaded by Mr. Ablir of the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and personnel from Comelec. <BR><BR>For ABC president, Mr. Albert Aquino of Barangay Bantayan emerged to be the winner who garnered 29 votes. His opponents for the same post were Antonio Carino of Barangay Calindagan who got 8 votes and Ramil Cornelia of Barangay Pulantubig who got 3 votes.<BR><BR>The lone candidate and winner as ABC Vice President is Leoniel Banogon of Barangay Bunao, Elected Secretary is Angelita Ragay of Barangay Looc who got 21 votes, Treasurer is Delia Senagan of Barangay 8 who got 20 votes and Auditor is Delia Lado of Barangay with 29 votes. The Board of Directors are Barangay Captains: Nicolas Ramires, 27 votes; Gregoria Oira,  26 votes; Dominic Ablir, 26 votes; Bernardo Sun, 25 votes; Dionie Amores, 23 votes; Bartolome Aranas, 19 votes.<BR><BR>Indeed, the conduct of the ABC Elections was totally clean, healthy and peaceful.  Hon Bert Aquino was grateful and thankful to Hon. Manuel T. Sagarbarria and Hon. George P. Arnaiz for giving them freehand in this election.  Aquino stated in an interview by friends in the media including ABS-CBN that the recently concluded ABC Election signifies a change in politics. He said that politics in Dumaguete City is getting matured.  The trust of the City Mayor of Dumaguete and the Congressman of the Second District afforded them to indicate that political change now sets in and is going forward, where politics is for all even among the poor.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "url": "noise-pollution-p811-323.htm",
   "body": "<BR><BR>The term “noise pollution” generally refers to unwanted sound which is produced by human activities.  Unlike other forms of pollution, it is fleeting in that it doesn’t remain in the environment.  But it can become a pervasive presence and detract from the quality of our lives.   Unpleasantness of one kind or another cannot be entirely avoided or eliminated, but constant exposure to things which push our tolerance will lead to negative effects on us.   In its cumulative effects, noise pollution can lead to temporary or permanent  hearing loss. For some, it can provoke headache or migraines, while to others, it can result in loss of sleep, which of course compromises general health.<BR><BR>Yes, we love fiestas and other festive events in our town, especially if it brings good income to small and large businesses, from take out food stands to a large scale restaurants and hotels in this nice and easy going city of ours.  However, some residents in our neighborhoods may have low tolerance for noise or sounds in general. All I am simply saying that there needs to be some consideration to our residents who are trying to get a good night’s sleep but are bothered by the non-stop noise of all kinds, i.e. loud music, people’s loud voice talking or screaming, constant car horns, or worse, the sound of a bass instruments that tends to be a bit piercing to our eardrums. Of course, there are people may not be bothered such noise.  But what about the rest of us who are trying to have a peaceful evening after a long day at work or better yet, how about those who are trying to put babies to sleep but are having difficulty due to the loud noise in our neighborhoods? <BR><BR>I understand that there are certain ordinances that pertain to all barangays when it comes to business places making noise - cut-off times after which businesses must turn down loud music, etc.  But what about the numerous special occasions, the barangay fiestas or celebrations?  Does anything go during such times?  Should official events limit their noise levels as well, or perhaps limit the times during which loud music etc. is permitted?   In New York City, a lot of neighborhoods have made it illegal to use your car horn except when absolutely necessary, with fines of up to $500.    Loud noise (beyond a certain decibel level) in any one’s private home is also prohibited.  Noise pollution ordinances in the US were implemented to coerce people into doing what in a perfect world they would do naturally, being respectful and considerate. <BR><BR>Here in the Philippines, we tend to love parties until the wee hour of the morning. I say go for it, but should we at least consider having them in appropriate venues, so that those who are noise sensitive can have a peaceful night’s sleep.  For many, being bombarded by constant noise is simply a nuisance to our peace of mind, which in a way defeats the whole purpose of living here in a peaceful city like Dumaguete.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Remelisa Alfelor G. Moraleda, president of Northeastern Philippines University  in Bicol. Excerpts of her blog: <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">PRISAA or First PRISA</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Today is a great surprise!</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I attended a meeting of the Bicol Foundation on Higher Education. We hosted the meeting again of this organization of higher education institutions in the Bicol Region. Being a quarterly meeting of the organization, it was attended by the officers and board of directors only.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Our agenda list was long. The BFHE is the Regional Association on Higher Education Institutions  of the Bicol Region and being such, we discussed how we will go about with the CHED directed Academic and Cultural Competitions related to the CHED National Games. In a nutshell, if SCUAA, LCUAA, and PRISAA are now going to join for the CHED National Games (unified!), the RAHEIs and the NAHEIs are in charge of the academic and cultural competition portion of the games.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The discussion regarding Bicol Region’s participation was quite long so I will not bore anyone reading this with the details, but something really blew me away.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Apparently, the PRISAA national organization has transformed itself into a party-list organization calling itself First PRISA. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I don’t know how this happened. A lot of things are still fuzzy. But suffice it to say that whatever is happening, the guys behind First PRISA are using the PRISAA to build a network of members throughout the country. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Remember, it is part of COMELEC accreditation requirements that a party-list organization has nationwide membership and representation to be classified as such.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Although it seems clear that PRISAA is a different entity from First PRISA, there is no doubt the people they have listed as their regional representatives are the same regional presidents of the local PRISAA. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">This is weird and crazy especially for us PRISAA member schools who were never informed of this development.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Honestly, as president of a University, and a paying member of PRISAA, I cannot help but think about the possibility of First PRISA using PRISAA funds to further their cause without the consent of its general membership.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Right now, we -- along with several other member schools -- are thinking of withdrawing our membership from PRISAA, lest we be used for the political interest of others without our knowledge or consent.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Actually, what I really feel so bad about is how this exhibits how the PRISAA national officers see their members. They see us as minions rather than equals or partners to attain the goals of PRISAA.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I will blog some more about this as soon as I get more information. But still, this thing stinks like after-flood garbage in Marikina.</span><br><br>In my column last week, I wrote: “There are many issues to be raised regarding the management of the PRISAA…such as d) an intriguing party-list whose candidates include (former CHED chairman Emmanuel Angeles’ son), Gabriel Martin L. Angeles, president and CEO of the Angeles University Foundation Medical Center, in the last elections garnering 25,211 with an interesting acronym: 1st PRISA which stands for “First People’s Representative for Indigent Student Athletes.” <br><br>Is there a sinister plan of Angeles to use the PRISAA to establish a political base for this party-list?<br><br>And continuing, “We call on other member institutions in our University Town to join FU in this campaign to institute reforms in the PRISAA. Other members in other parts of our country are joining us. We look forward to the administration of Silliman University, St. Paul University Dumaguete, NORSU and ACSAT to be one with FU.”<br><br> The two biggest and influential higher institutions in the Cordillera Administrative Region -- St. Louis University of Baguio and the University of the Cordilleras -- have committed to join the boycott.<br><br>We anticipate that the Consortium in Higher Education of Negros Oriental will be with FU and the other HEIs who will join the boycott.<br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Christmas is a time to celebrate that God loves you, that God is with you, and that God is for you.

Mother was gone and Father was raising his three young children by himself. No church, no festivities, no <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">panulindaw</span> to alert us to the Advent Season – just Father’s startled statement that night: “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Uy</span>, it’s Christmas again!” He told the Christmas story and sang <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The First Noel</span> to us. In our dimly-lit room, I thought the song sounded so sad, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“…on a cold winter’s night that was so deep….”</span> But he added: “Christmas will be different when ‘peace time’ returns.”  Two more Christmases were spent on the hills, times mixed with fear and anxiety that the adults communicated to us of the possibility that a Japanese patrol might find our hiding place. When the war ended, it was like entering a new world, as Father had said, Christmas was different.  Today, although I live in relatively peaceful Dumaguete, blessed by the luxury of celebrating Christmas unlike those stark Christmases so long ago, the elusiveness of peace on earth brings sadness to the Season. And at my age, hope is hard to come by.  -- <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Lorna Peña-Reyes Makil, sociologist</span><br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>All Philippine islands when Ferdinand Magellan arrived in the country in the mid 16th century were, in general, thickly clothed with mixtures in various proportions of mangrove forest, beach forest, tropical rainforest, monsoon forest, hardwood forest, and other forest types probably by as much as 90 percent of their area cover. <BR><BR>Thousands of higher plant species were found in these forests. <BR><BR>The marine and fresh water ecosystems extant today may be assumed to harbor all the approximately 2,500 species of fish, the 27 species of marine mammals and other aquatic vertebrates, and the thousands of invertebrate species we see today. <BR><BR>Likewise, the land can also be assumed to be teeming with some 1,100 species (and still counting) of terrestrial vertebrates that are known to be present today in the various microhabitats in the forests. <BR><BR>Magellan and his men also found people living on the islands they landed to claim them as part of the territory of Spain. <BR><BR>Unfortunately, he met strong resistance by a group of Filipinos living on the island of Mactan led by the man we now call Lapulapu. <BR><BR>In the ensuing battle along the coast of Mactan fringed with mangrove and coral reef, Magellan and some of his men were killed. <BR><BR>Later, Filipino leaders erected a monument in honor of Magellan. But I am told that the monument to honor Lapulapu was erected much later!   <BR><BR>What is described in the first paragraph is the most likely picture of Philippine islands 500 years ago, which can be considered as a pristine environment.  <BR><BR>Mactan Island, a part of the larger Cebu Island in the past, was probably not too different from Cebu or Negros, both of which used to form a single island in the past. <BR><BR>Actual surveys on land vertebrates in the mid-1900s showed a depauperate vertebrate fauna on Mactan as compared with Cebu or Negros. <BR><BR>It can be inferred that various forest microhabitats on Mactan in the past had similar fauna and flora as Cebu and Negros, many of which have been lost in the course of time.<BR><BR>But as can be seen now, it lacks the species diversity of ecosystems and associated biological components, although a part of its marine ecosystem, namely few coral reefs, continue to exist and are to a very limited extent a tourist destination. <BR><BR>But the mangroves have been reduced to stunted forms, and seem unable to develop into the climax status, probably because of the altered environmental conditions. <BR><BR>The island’s poor biodiversity is indicated by fewer fish fauna and fewer terrestrial vertebrate species.  It is, however, considered a developed human community with a large number of people residing on it. <BR><BR>But the people have to pay a high price in that no potable water exists on the island, and drinking water has to be brought in from outside sources. <BR><BR>The large human population is probably the reason for the presence of chemical pollutants, notably from waste water and toilets, in its coastal waters. <BR><BR>The whole island has been altered from what it used to be hundreds of years ago.<BR><BR>From Mactan, we move to the remote island of Siargao situated in the Pacific Ocean. Siargao, like many islands formed by volcanic action several million years ago, is primarily made of limestone and has thin top soil that is not productive for farming purposes, but rainforests and mangroves are well developed. <BR><BR>Rainforests were logged for their commercial tree species, including the lauan group or Philippine mahogany and the iron wood. <BR><BR>Areas from where these trees have been removed are now occupied by coconut trees, most of which are doing poorly and are non-productive. <BR><BR>However, the remaining forest estimated at about 20 percent of the island’s land area still hosts some biodiversity species unique to Siargao, notably the Indo-Pacific Crocodile, and a yet unnamed species of forest frog. <BR><BR>A thorough survey of the rainforest and the mangroves would probably yield more new forms of life. <BR><BR>In the marine waters of Siargao are rare deep-sea fish species not common to other Philippine islands. All these are valuable resources that can be used in a sustainable manner to benefit the people of Siargao. <BR><BR>Despite the disappearance of some of its original flora and fauna due to past exploitation, Siargao still retains some of its pristine character. But these features may eventually be lost over time if conservation measures are not put in place soon. If these measures are not implemented soon, Siargao will surely go the way of many Philippine islands that have lost their uniqueness, and are now biological deserts.<BR><BR>Siargao has been proclaimed part of the Philippine national protected areas system since 1996, but this does seem to be working well, as indicated by many violations of this proclamation. <BR><BR>The island’s human population is expanding rapidly. Very soon, people will need places on which to build their homes. <BR>Zoning of the island into protected areas and areas for human habitation is therefore in order. <BR><BR>In this regard, both the nine local government units (which need to act as a unit in the governance of the whole island) and the national government through the Protected Areas & Wildlife Bureau of the Department of Environment & Natural Resources should be involved in the zoning.<BR><BR>There is also a need to manage or control the rate of human population growth on the island, a primary concern of the LGUs. This is possible with the advent of family planning technology.<BR><BR>The coastal zone of the island should be given urgent attention. Many resorts have sprouted along the shoreline, and most of them have ignored DENR guidelines on building infrastructures on beaches. This is necessary in view of the rising sea level of the Pacific Ocean as a result of climate change.<BR><BR>In summary, for Siargao to avoid going the way of other small Philippine islands that have lost their unique environmental features and biodiversity resources, local governments and the national government should ensure that its natural resources are conserved and managed well to provide for food security and income of the people. <BR><BR>Tourism with proper safeguards should be given attention. LGUs should continue to improve facilities and infrastructures such as hospitals, schools, and road system of the island. <BR><BR>Urgent measures to slow down the rate of population growth should be implemented as the island soil is too poor to support a large population in terms of agricultural products. <BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

If delayed, I’d miss that overbooked flight for Bangkok.  As a “martial law refugee”, Thailand was my United Nations station for 17 years. Four of five kids were flying in, from US schools, for Christmas.<br><br>Shifting his battered  tin can, the beggar persisted. “Don’t you remember me?” Seeing my blank, he murmured : “We were classmates in elementary school...I’m Candido….”<br><br>Memory scraped away the wrinkles,  dirt and in-between years. We had played the games of childhood. Together, we built model airplanes and sailed toy boats.

Couldn’t I have dropped, into his tin cup, more than what was hurriedly fished out of a shirt pocket?, I fretted even as the immigration officer waved us on.<br><br>We’re all invited to journey to Bethlehem.  <br><br>For some, like Imelda Marcos, the invitation comes, as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Guardian</span> notes, while she “clicks a button for servants in a Manila penthouse cluttered with masterpieces by Picasso, Gaugin, priceless antique Buddha statues -- and gold, gold, gold.” <br><br>Others, like my beggared-classmate, wearily limp to “the City of David” with empty tin cans. <br><br>Billionaires here lodge in “gated enclaves” while many lack frugal livelihoods. “There was no room in the inn.” <br><br>Yet, “Christmas is the only time I know of when men and women, seem by one consent, to open their shut-up hearts freely,” Charles Dickens wrote in 1843. <br><br>Like the re-engineered Ebenezer Scrooge, they “think of people below them, not as another race of creatures bound on other journeys, but as fellow passengers to the grave.”<br><br>I’ve never seen my beggar-friend since.  But he forms part of Christmases past. As the years slip by, these faces remain. Revisiting them, one discovers a bittersweet (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">chiaroscurro</span>) tone overlays the montage.<br><br>Images include kindnesses by friends one now rarely sees. I dashed out to talk with a pediatrician, glimpsed midway through an Advent mass. Dr. Miguel Celdran lavished care on my now-grown kids. I wanted Mike to meet my lawyer-daughter and her doctor-husband  from San Francisco, visiting for Christmas. But he had left.<br><br>ROME -- “That season comes wherein our Saviour’s birth is celebrated/The bird of dawning singeth all night long,” At the Divine Word fathers’ Verbiti headquarters, Filipino OFWs sang carols. These included, of course, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ang Pasko ay Sumapit</span> -- the Tagalog adaptation of the 1933 Visayan daygon: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kadsadya ning Takna-a.</span> English carols have long blotted out Spanish carols like <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nacio, Nacio Pastores. </span><br><br>Star lanterns festooned Verbiti. Lights blinked from a Nativity crib or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">belen</span>. Even lechons were on the table. But corrosive loneliness contorted the faces of many, separated from kith and kin, in this “hallowed and gracious time”. <br><br>Tears slipped past tightly-closed eyes. Here is part of the overseas  worker  diaspora’s untabulated costs. Hidden behind those foreign exchange remittances are pain, separation, alienation, trauma even. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tiene cara de hambre.</span><br><br>Christmas is “Emmanuel — God with us” in the dark, loneliness and pain, Filipino SVD fathers told their expat flock “There are no more unvisited places in our lives.”<br><br>JAKARTA -- Illnesses in absent family is shattering, especially so for expatriates. We trudged to the Crib in Gereja Theresia (St Therese’s Church) behind the giant mall Sarina. Half a world away, alone in a Los Angeles hospital, a diaspora statistic — my younger brother — lay dying.<br><br>Jesse called in January. Life is fragile, he began. We don’t know when we’ll see each other again. “Let’s meet in Cebu”. So he flew in from LA. Our only sister came from Toronto. The wife and I took the flight from Bangkok. We had a laughter-filled week with our then 86-year old mother. <br><br>Our mother went July. “Please. No heroic measures,” our sister-in-law told the cardiac team that rushed in. And by Christmas, Jesse was gone, too.<br><br>The Child of Bethlehem enables us to glimpse beyond the grave. “Death is not the extinguishing of life,” the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore wrote. “It is putting out the lamp because dawn has come.”<br><br>BANGKOK -- From our third floor flat, we’d watch this Thai lady slip into the deserted courtyard of Holy Redeemer Church. Draped in the Advent dawn’s darkness, she’d pray before the picture of Our Lady of Perpetual Help -- until <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Misa de Gallo</span>, introduced by Filipino workers, started. <br><br>Her silhouette brought Isaiah’s lines to mind: “The people who sit in darkness have seen a great light. Kings shall (stream) to the brightness of thy rising.”  That silhouette, like the image of a prisoner, also forms part of our Christmases past.<br><br>MUNTINLUPA -- Clad in stained orange togs, the prisoner wouldn’t budge. If delayed, I’d miss a dinner appointment. Seeing my blank look, he murmured: “Don’t you remember me? We were playmates in Cebu. My name is Policarpio….”<br><br>There is, we’re told, a geography of the heart. Like the Magi, we travel its byways, not merely from place to place, but from grace to grace. It is a search for what endures amid the transient.

Certainly, we all felt positive about the future, young as we were; the unthinkable future of Estrellita Vizconde was dying of 13 stab wounds, with her 18 year-old daughter gang-raped and killed by 17 stab wounds, and her seven year-old daughter dying of 19 stab wounds.  Their convicted and jailed murderers, led by a member of a prominent family,  have just been acquitted by the Supreme Court.<BR><BR>The much-quoted line above feels particularly apt now, for many people who feel a deep malaise from successive blows to a sense of order, decency, and justice, blows to our trust in the highest national institutions.  <BR><BR>That at other levels, there is often a lack of vision, capability,  effectiveness or even corruption is cause enough for demoralization but may not shake us as when it is the Supreme Court or as in the immediate past, the highest official in the land, that are in question.  <BR><BR>Shakespeare’s words are of something rotten  “in the state” and not just “in Denmark”,  referring to problems with their source at the top of the body politic. <BR>   <BR> Thelma Chiong was in Dumaguete recently. In the terrible Cebu case many years ago,  her two daughters disappeared, and the brutally murdered body of one was found.  <BR><BR>A more recent blow followed with the turn-over to Spanish custody of one of the six convicted and jailed murderers of her daughter.  <BR><BR>A dual citizen, a member of a prominent Cebu family appealed to serve his sentence in a presumably more comfortable Spanish jail than put up with conditions in this country where he committed the crime.  <BR><BR>The past Philippine president and the Department of Foreign Affairs apparently had no objection at all to letting him go. Presidential pardons for the most notorious cases of child rape and of murder also marked the closing years of the previous administration.  The pardoned often had prominent names.<BR><BR>Years of presidential decisions and acts of questionable legality created during the previous administration,  a pervasive sense of rot at the top. We hoped with the passing of that unloved administration to emerge into fresher, cleaner air and the famous “straight road.”<BR><BR>However,  some recent high court decisions are causing the smell of rot to linger, for example,  disallowing, on weak grounds as legal commentators explain,  the establishment of a Truth Commission,   and affirming the past administrations’ “midnight appointments.”   <BR><BR>Those who closely followed the Vizconde case did note prosecution weaknesses but saw its strengths, too, pointing to the murderers of Estrellita and her daughters.  <BR><BR>But now the high court has spoken, and they are free.

The three of us have extensive experience in Olympic-style amateur boxing.<br><br>Joe Clough was named three times Best Boxing Coach in USA in 1972, 1976, 1977.  He was hired my Muhammad Ali to head coach position for his amateur boxing program at Santa Monica in California (1978-1980), USA PanAm Games coach 1983, Thailand National and Olympic Game Boxing Coach 1984, national head coach in Malaysia, coach of the 1986 Asian Games Philippines Boxing Team, coach clinician to many S.E. Asian countries. <br><br>Clough has had gold medalists at both the Munich and Montreal Olympic Games, where he had two of his own boxers on the USA Olympic team.<br><br>We all are committed to the safety of our youth who participate in our wonderful, however, difficult, disciplined sport of Olympic-style boxing. <br><br>Our course at Silliman covers the basic technical and mental skills needed to prepare students to train and learn how to properly box. <br><br>In addition, as college level students, they are taught the history of boxing with its recorded origins nearly 10,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, later in ancient Egypt, Greece, Crete, the Roman Empire, and the English revival of boxing starting in 1661 through the end of the bare-knuckle period in 1889.<br><br>Completing the course of study is learning the Technical & Competition Rules as set forth by the Association Internationale Boxe Amateur with more than 200 countries of the world being member federations.  <br><br>In the Philippines, the Amateur Boxing Association of the Philippines is the national federation governing all Olympic-style boxing in the country. <br><br>It is hoped that a students will have the academic knowledge to be able to pass the certification test given by ABAP at some time in their lives, and participate as officials in their local regions, or if abroad, join the national federation to participate in this Olympic sport. <br><br>The learning of the long history of the sport is an added benefit as it can help students engage in interesting conversations about a topic which has the interest of millions of people on a global scale. It may prove a valuable asset in making friends, or aiding finding employment.<br><br>Learning the physical technical skills needed to perform the sport has the benefit of acquiring information to be a skilled spectator with a keen eye as a non participant, but be able to live a more healthy lifestyle as well as appreciate boxers/athletes who excel in this sport. <br><br>ESPN a couple of years ago did a study to determine the best conditioned athletes on the planet.<br><br>My wife and I are both USA Boxing and ABAP officials and have run a successful boxing program at Yuma, Arizona,  and helped form the La Colonia Youth Boxing Association (1990-1992) in Oxnard, California.  The program produced USA’s youngest Olympic boxer Fernando Vargas1996 Olympics and Carlos Martinez Mexican Olympic team (1996).  We have been certified USA boxing clinicians since 2003.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Fred B.

They’re in the band for the annual Christmas Parade at Foundation University, and it’s just now getting organized.<BR><BR>In front of her the honor guards are polishing gold braid and checking their flags; behind her is the rest of the band, tentatively tuning instruments and banging drums. Behind the band comes the restless clank and rattle of a long stream of contingent groups, with chugging generators and lights; with costumes, props, and floats, stretching out half a kilometer along the bypass road. <BR><BR>But this is not unique to Dumaguete at Christmas time. This photograph, this girl, waiting with her cell phone and her clarinet- she could just as well be in some small City in America, or Canada, or Australia; or in England, or Italy, or Spain, for that matter- any culturally Christian country that celebrates Christmas, and has parades with horns and clarinets.<BR><BR>But you wouldn’t  see this girl and her clarinet in China, or Japan, or Indonesia, or any other Asian country. Those countries don’t celebrate Christmas, and they don’t usually have parades with marching bands-- unless the parade includes tanks and artillery or other weapons of destruction.<BR><BR>The Philippines is unique and alone in this part of the world.  Although racially Asian, with an Asian family structure and moral values, it is culturally and religiously part of the West. Unlike the countries surrounding it, it is mostly Christian; most of its newspapers, books, and even its laws are written in English; and the people look mainly to the West, to America and Europe, for new trends and style. <BR><BR>Because of this, Filipinos are foreigners to other Asians; and because of their underlying Asian values, they are a puzzle to Americans and Europeans too.  In fact, the rest of the world can’t figure out who or what they are, or where to put them in their minds; so they do their best to ignore them altogether. And they’re missing out on a culture that might very well be a precursor of the cultures of the future.<BR><BR>But these concerns are far from the mind of this girl with her clarinet. She’s just impatiently waiting to begin her Christmas parade, to go marching through the humid tropical streets of Dumaguete, playing a famous American march by John Philip Sousa.<BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport1219.jpg\"><BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>As December 25 falls on a Saturday, this is our Christmas issue. This promises to be the longest Christmas week. Many will choose to spend this time to go shopping while there will be others who might want to travel. Still, there will be others who would opt to just chill out these next few days. There are many ways to spend Christmas but it would also be good to remember why we are celebrating it.<BR><BR>Christmas is not just another of the too many holidays in this country, as the business sector would put it. The reason we celebrate Christmas is because we are a Christian nation, or we call ourselves Christians. For Christians, this holiday signifies the birth of Jesus Christ more than 2000 years ago in Bethlehem. This was the start of our culture of gift-giving. God himself gave us His only son as a gift to the entire world.<BR><BR>You may not be a deeply religious person but that will not stop you from enjoying Christmas. We share the meaning of Christmas when we give of ourselves to others. We can give gifts, our time or our talent.<BR><BR>We may also try thanksgiving. We Filipinos don’t have the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. but nothing should stop us from spending Christmas to give thanks to the source of all our blessings this past year. This is the time we count our blessings and reflect on how good life has been and how good life will be in the year to come.<BR><BR>Reflecting on and being thankful for our blessings is not necessarily because we had everything going our way but because we have chosen to do something to adapt to whatever situation life has in store for us.<BR><BR>Christmas is also a time when we revitalize our direct line to God. When was the last time you really poured out your heart to God in prayer? This could be the first time in years for many of us.<BR><BR>The point of celebrating Christmas is to emerge refreshed and more determined to take on life’s challenges for the coming months with the assurance that the same Jesus Christ, who has been our help in ages past, would be our hope for years to come.<BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Whenever he is in Manila, Absin never misses the chance to visit the Dapitan Arcade, which sells Christmas decorations as early as February, SM, and the shops in Divisoria and Binondo.<br><br>Each Christmas brings out a new theme. He once transformed his place into a castle where the likes of Cinderella, Snow White, and other fairy tale creatures, came to life.<br><br>For this year, Absin has converted his home into the Emerald City, inspired by the 1939 American musical fantasy film <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Wizard of Oz</span>. “We’ll be playing songs like <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Somewhere over the Rainbow, If I were King of the Forest,</span> and other favorites,” Absin announced.  <br><br>He is rushing a replica of Wizard of Oz star character Dorothy’s ruby slippers, which will be prominently displayed at the center of his elaborately-decorated dining table, where his antique silverware are laid out for a  feast, complete with the names of guests and the menu on each plate. <br><br>For this replica of one of the world’s most expensive pair of shoes, Dr. Absin is having a pair of his late mother’s shoes wrapped in sequins. “My mother left so many shoes that I’m now thinking of just displaying them altogether,” he said.<br><br>While Absin loves seeing people enjoy the beautiful decorations which also fill every room of his home, he prefers to occasionally disappear from view. “I hide. I don’t want my guests to be intimidated by my presence,” he says.<br><br>With his expanding collection, Absin now finds it necessary to employ more people to ensure that the decorations are maintained. For this, he has 15 workers who get paid out of the minimum entrance fee at the gate.<br><br>But aside from admiring the decorations they may never get to see in their own homes, children get a special treat on Christmas Day. <br><br>“I’m ordering 500 McDonald’s breakfast packs for the children, on top of some donated toys and gift items such as bags and pencils. <br><br>The breakfast is partly sponsored by fund-raising dinners arranged by Absin’s friends. <br><br>Indeed, as more friends and donors get involved in this project, the Dumaguete Christmas House tradition could only get bigger with each year. “It’s tedious but it’s fun,” Absin says, “and the people of Dumaguete look forward to this.”<br><br><a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index261.htm\">For pictures of Dr. Absin's Christmas House, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">click here</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index261.htm\">.</a><br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>Our Negros Oriental Wildlife Conservation Council was created in 2003 via an Executive Order of the former Gov. George Arnaiz. Included in this EO was the declaration of the month of November as wildlife conservation month and continues to be celebrated today through the efforts of the council and its partners. The main objective of this annual celebration is to promote biodiversity conservation through wildlife preservation and protection.{{more}} <br><br>Our province of Negros Oriental, through the NOWCC (currently chaired by Vice-Gov. Roel R. Degamo) and its partners, has been engaged in several activities to promote education and awareness on the current status of our wildlife and biodiversity. It is important to note that a healthy biodiversity and wildlife is a key indicator of a healthy and balanced eco-system.<br><br>Pol Cariño of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pederasyon sa Nagkahiusang mga Mag-uuma nga Nanalipud ug Nagpasig-uli sa Kinaiyahan Inc.</span> (PENAGMANNAKI) and his colleagues at Friends of the Environment in Negros Oriental (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">FENOr</span>) worked with Vice Governor Degamo and the NOWCC to get the activities started with proper funding. The activities were mapped out for the month of November but some are scheduled for December and 2011 to keep the momentum going.<br><br>In the afternoon of Nov 11th, we held a seminar on the Basics of Biodiversity by Jean Utzurrum, Integrated Water Resources Management by Judith Alpuerto, Threats to Biodiversity by Leo Mamicpic, Wildlife Monitoring and Evaluation by Pol Cariño and Environmental Justice by Atty. Mikhail Maxino. In attendance were our NegOr mountaineers, Provincial Environment Desk Officers, other PNP officers, the media and other guests. There were close to 275 attendees. Dondee Señeris of St. Paul University arranged for the use of SPUD gymnasium as our venue. This successful activity was co-hosted by Kapihan sa PIA and facilitated by Jenny Tilos.<br><br>On Nov. 13th, the 4th Wet & Wild Exhibit was officially launched at Robinsons Place in Dumaguete. The exhibit will run through December. FENOr along with friends from 350.org, Alpha Sigma Phi of SU and the mountaineering clubs all gathered the night before to setup the exhibit. <br><br>On Nov. 14th, a Wet & Wild awareness campaign was held at the Rizal Blvd. With gratitude to Roy Cang, the event kicked off with three mountaineers rappelling down the north side of Bethel Guest House while they unfurled our huge Biodiversity Is Our Life poster. This event was facilitated by FENOr with the Dumaguete City Government providing electricity, lighting and sound system. There were video presentations by 350.org, a clever skit on biodiversity by the Youth Advocates Through Theatre & Arts (YATTA), a relevant ‘trash’ion show by Youth of Iglesia Filipina Independiente (YIFI) and several tent exhibits by mountaineering clubs. The Dumaguete Kalikasan Performers opened the boulevard program with a rousing Drum Call that attracted and gathered many folks in the area. <br><br>Nov. 19th - our 5th Provincial Wildlife Conservation Quiz Bowl, facilitated by Jean Utzurrum and the SU Biological Society was held at the Moot Court of the SU College of Law. This competition was open to all high schools in the province. Represented were: Pulangbato NHS, Mabinay NHS, Valencia NHS, Camanjac NHS, SUHS, Sibulan Science HS, FUHS, Balugo NHS and NOHS. SU President Dr. Ben S. Malayang III emphasized in his welcome address that although this was a competition, it was important to reflect on the questions they could not answer; to gain and inculcate into our lives a thorough knowledge of biodiversity and wildlife conservation; and to clearly understand and exercise our role as stewards of our precious environment. Also on this day, a similar competition was held in Negros Occidental. The top three schools from each province will compete in the Island-wide Wildlife Conservation Quiz Bowl to be held in Bacolod on Nov. 25th.  For NegOr, our top three schools were: SUHS, FUHS and Mabinay NHS.<br><br>Nov. 20th was our tree planting day in Lawigan, Bacong. Our guide for this activity was none other than expert local dendrologist Rene Vendiola shown at left photo with some “tree planters” behind him: The Lawigan tree planting is a continuing pet project of Bacong Mayor Lenin Alviola who has a team of LGU employees planting trees and doing tree-growing maintenance every Saturday morning. Since Bacong has no watershed, Mayor Alviola is seeing to it that trees (mostly endemic) are planted along the rivers and on hillside areas to help in the reforestation and conservation of a most precious resource, water. <br><br>The planters were colleagues and supporters of FENOr, UUCP, 350.org, SPUD students, mountaineers, and Bacong LGU employees. Many LGU employees were there early and had already dug up the holes to plant the trees in. And plant we did, a total of 350 endemic trees. We would like to thank Mayor Alviola for giving us the opportunity to be a small part of his truly worthwhile endeavor. <br><br>Nov. 25th – Wildlife Conservation Island-wide  Quiz Bowl in Bacolod City. On Nov. 24th our NegOr contingent left for Bacolod. Our contingent was composed of six HS students/competitors, three respective teacher/coaches, and FENOr. We arrived ca. noon, had lunch and checked in at our designated hotel. Accommodations were courtesy of the Negros Forest and Ecological Foundation, Inc. (NFEFI). We visited the Biodiversity Conservation Center of NFEFI and were greeted by our host, Mimie Ledesma. <br><br>On Nov. 25th, we were at the NegOcc Capitol, the venue for the quiz bowl. We met the contingents from the Top 3 high schools of NegOcc along with their respective teachers/coaches. These were: Sta. Rosa of Lima HS, Mansilingan Agro-Industrial HS and Sum-ag NHS. We also met the team from NFEFI .<br><br>The results are in: 1st Place – Mansilingan Agro-Industrial HS; 2nd Place – Sum-ag NHS; 3rd Place – Foundation University HS; 4th Place – Silliman University HS; 5th Place – Sta. Rosa HS; and 6th Place – Mabinay NHS. <br><br>NFEFI, together with NegOcc Provincial Environment Management Office, hosted and facilitated the island-wide quiz bowl event. Next year, it will be Negros Oriental’s turn to host this island-wide activity.<br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

No event is as controversial as Christmas Day and the Yuletide Tidings.  <br><br>No matter what, the Sillimanians in Sydney could not wait for the 25th of December to celebrate the day.  We already welcomed the glad tidings last 4th of December at the Garcia Home in Casula, Sydney.<br><br>Engr. Enrico “Toto” and Lily Garcia played the perfect hosts to our early Christmas celebration.  As a group, the SU Sydney Chapter brought  to the table <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lechon carajay</span>.  Arnie Capilitan added <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">kinilaw</span>,  while Joy Torrevillas pitched in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">bico</span>, giving a Phillippine air to the merrymaking.   <br><br>Adobo was served, too.  If they were to have their way, Toto and Lily might have served <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Bais pusit</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tanjay budbod</span>, too. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Bayawan bayebaye</span> could have been the dessert to enjoy.   We had something better with Leonora “Inday” Cabanag’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">crema de fruta</span>-- a treat we relished with gusto.  <br><br>Mr. Kodaker of the SU Sydney Chapter Clarence “Bobby” Cabanag posted promptly frozen frames of the celebration with the first frame collaged for SU President Ben Malayang III’s Christmas message.  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“May Christ continue to thrive in your homes, and may you continue to breathe life into others as God’s instrument of grace to all!  From...our campus by the sea, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. </span>”<br><br>There’s the reason.  There’s the cause why we celebrate Christmas.  God’s grace.  Sweet Baby Jesus.  God’s Word made flesh.  God’s Love displayed to lift man up from his wretchedness.  Immanuel has stepped down from Heaven to be with us, to be one of us.  <br><br>Born on a manger, surrounded by sheep and shepherds.  Grew to be a carpenter and a Teacher of the fishers of men, not a warrior to be King of Kings to set free the Israelites from under Roman oppression.  <br><br>Jesus told his disciples “you will be known as my followers if you love one another” as their small band pursued the ministry of healing to which disillusioned the Pharisees and Sadducees who rejected the Messiah.  <br><br>Could not imagine Love as the weapon to subdue the Romans.  Hard to imagine for Love to be the means to establish Peace on Earth and Goodwill among men.  Hard to accept the concept even now as it was then. The old world then as the culture now is in mode-denial of love, joy, peace...the fruits of the spirit.<br><br>Dumaguete City is in dark forebodings.  Gang wars on city streets are growing to be a menace.  The hostility has claimed two teenage casualties.  Fear grips the air.  <br><br>Just like the Phillippines and other Asian countries feeling the shivers of a North-South Korean war.  Being a proxy war, it will easily develop into a grand-scale confrontation of their superpower allies in a mutual nuclear annihilation.  <br><br>Fear-driven, airport authorities in the USA subject passengers to full body radiation scan and humiliating pat down in an attempt to seek out terrorists from getting into the country.  The effort to get in control seems to be in vain as Wikileaks exposed the seamy side of American diplomacy opening a new arena of mental engagement in cyberspace.  <br><br>A cyber war has ensued between Wikileaks supporters who hail its founder Julian Assange as a hero and fighter for the freedom of expression, and those who condemn him as a terrorist and fugitive of a sex abuse charge in Switzerland.  Where is the love?  Paranoia prevails.<br><br>Broiling in hot spots of the world like Afghanistan and Palestine, man persists in wickedness.  He lives by the sword and headed to perish by the sword.  <br><br>Just like yesteryears when the Romans ruled Israel by the sword, the chosen people waited for the Messiah to deliver them from their bondage.  They expected a Messiah to lead them   to meet force with force and fight violence with violence.  Power was their motive force -- power to mutilate or annihilate the hated enemies.  <br><br>Given by Pilate the choice to either set free Jesus or Barabbas, they chose Barabbas, quite symbolic for man’s preference to hate and destroy rather than to love and heal.  <br><br>Techno-man with far potent weapons of mass destruction hugs the vicious cycle in deathly embrace.  Where is the Servant King who washed Peter’s feet of clay?<br><br>Materially-bound, we are distracted from the real meaning of Christmas.  With the gift-giving come-on, we succumb to its crash commercialization.  We pay more attention to the pagan symbols of the celebration -- Christmas tree and kissing under the mistletoe.  Even Santa Claus has supplanted the Baby Jesus in prominence especially in commercial establishments’ Yuletide displays.  <br><br>While Christmas has become Xmas as pluralism makes much ado of 25th of December as a pagan celebration.  <br><br>As we lean more on our own understanding, we tend to be multi-culturally sensitive.  Even believers are wont to be more politically correct by submitting to the idea that Christmas is just another human holiday while unknowingly succumbing to the wiles, not of flesh and blood, but of the rulers of darkness. <br><br>Downhill-bent, we are missing the real reason for the season -- the cause we are to uphold during the christmas season. That God is taking the initiative to redeem fallen man from alienation. That God is love.  That Jesus is God’s Love displayed.  That there is an urgent need to establish a loving relationship with Him before we can ever establish a loving relationship with each other.  <br><br>The real message of Christmas is Love to uphold peace and good will among men.<br><br>Like Peter, we are in denial mode.  Unlike Peter, we are yet to make our turn-around.  Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gloria in excelsis deo</span>.<br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

It took us sometime to decide who to send because I rarely attend PRISAA meetings which is usually attended by our Athletic & Sports Coordinator.

So my last column of  the year must be submitted on Monday, Dec. 20. Normally I have a week between columns; now-- just three days. They’re only short pieces-- one of my photographs plus 400 words of commentary. But because they’re short, they’re very exacting to produce.<BR><BR> I have to find a picture that seems appropriate; then I have to figure out what I’m going to say, and then the way to say it. Then I have to look at the combination of picture and words and see if it works. Often I have to change both parts several times to make it something worth reading: sometimes really strong, sometimes just OK; but anyway something good enough to print. <BR><BR>Three days isn’t long enough to do that. If  I tried to rush something out now, some reflection appropriate to the season, the result would probably be a mess-- embarrassing to me, and boring to the reader. <BR><BR>So, this time, just a two more happy holiday pictures from the FU Christmas parade: Merry Christmas!

And hardly are those over when the Province’s official website Buglas News Central announces: “The provincial government of Negros Oriental is bringing entertainment to Negrenses in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pasko sa Sidlakan 2010</span>.  <br><br>Oh yes, please, we so need to be entertained!  <br><br>So what is the provincial government offering this time? Why,  dance sport,  K-Pop (whatever that is), minus-one singing of carols, parade of bands (in Christmas attire!), belen competition,  fashion show, ham-making contest, as well as the lighting of a giant tree.<br><br>Other municipalities and cities are no slouches either. Where I live, the local fiesta has now inflated to a month and a half-long affair of at least five successive noisy disco dances, martial arts demonstration, live bands and “battle of the bands”,  variety show, beauty contest,  mountain bike race,  off-road  “extreme challenge”,  street parade, basketball games, talent show, fireworks, of course, games and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">karambola</span>, etc.  That’s some overload of entertainment!  <br><br>Whatever happened to the fiesta as tribute to the town’s religious patron?  Well, all of these events do include an opening mass or religious service and sometimes, a procession, as a vestige of the original, historical meaning of the fiesta,  but that’s practically reduced to the level of a  pretext.  There’s no mistaking today’s real intent: to entertain the people.<br><br>There must be some political calculation behind all this entertainment for, after all, considerable mobilization of government employees, working time, and resources are required, not to mention that of civil society.  <br><br>Conventional justifications include the goals of building community spirit and cohesion,  promoting tourism, or  gaining economic profit.  <br><br>Now, on this latter point, I don’t think anyone has seen any serious accounting of actual expenses and profits; instead,  there are statements by the organizers about hotels, restaurants, tricycles being patronized and products being sold, but that doesn’t add up to an economic analysis.  <br><br>How smaller town fiestas justify their expenditures is even more vague, considering the plethora of inane activities.  <br><br>Perhaps bolstering the administrations’ popularity is the real goal. Or to make people briefly forget the inadequacy of government programs and services.<br><br>This isn’t to say that fiestas and festivals have no value. Sports promotion, especially for the young, is a great objective.  But then we’d need to see real and well-funded sports development programs in place in the Province or towns,  and the festival or fiesta could then showcase what has been achieved.  <br><br>Cultural development is a great goal, but all those <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">bulilit</span> or senior minus-one contests,  the extravagant costumes and choreographed moves of street dancing can only by a stretch  fall under that category.  <br><br>Product development and promotion would be great, but why was there hardly anything new or of interest in those many Sidlakan booths?  <br><br>In these times of critical problems calling for serious and urgent responses from government, the decent and responsible thing would be to scale-down the extravagance, to eliminate the unnecessary and the environmentally damaging,  to simplify. <br><br>Christmas should be the best time of year, for children and families and communities.  It does not need to be cheapened by more mindless entertainment.  <br><br>My own best Christmas memories are of lovely midnight choral concerts in church, of family gatherings and children’s happiness.  <br><br>May your holidays be joyful!<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

It was a  demand, not a request,  so unlike the typical  children carolers.<br><br>Has  the  old “gimme”  syndrome  trumped  carols freely sang for gifts freely given? But those  kids  are nothing compared to some officials who straddle  government  corporations (GOCCs) or  financial agencies.<br><br>Ask Sen. Franklin  Drilon.   Metropolitan Waterworks & Sewerage System directors,  he found,   gorged on three types of  Christmas bonuses -- plus 32 other kinds throughout the year.  <br><br>Granting  “unwarranted allowances, bonuses, incentives, stock options”, Christmas or no Christmas, has metastasized in most GOCCs.   <br><br>Among spendthrifts   are   Social Security System, Government Service Insurance System, to Subic and Clark Development Authority. <br> <br>Their  recklessness resulted in “ a noticeable increase  in the aggregate deficit of 14 monitored  (firms),” Asian Development Bank noted. “This brings their financial stability into question.”<br><br>This  Christmas, some 45  GOCCs  will lop slabs from a  P22.3 billion subsidy  as bonuses for  themselves, Sen. Ralph Recto cautioned. They’ll ladle Christmas cheer “through“corporate give-aways”. That  ranges from P9.1 million worth of  50,000 over-priced umbrellas to daily planners-cum-ballpens, snapped up at double  market  prices.<br><br>“Nobody says  government should play Scrooge,” Recto said. But enough is enough. Those  freebies  are  better spent for the ill-fed.  A  semblance of reason must  replace today’s  self-gorging.<br><br>President Benigno Aquino  froze  perks, until year’s end, for what former National Treasurer  Leonor Briones calls  the  government’s “corporate fat cats.”  <br><br>PNoy  has widespread  public support  as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Grinch Who Stole the Christmas</span> [Bonuses] – a play  on the  1957  character of  Dr. Seuss children’s book by a blogger.<br><br>He’ll have to provide leeway for performance-based bonuses. That’s an honored  method  to draw and  keep  brains, specially in banks. For now, he must  crack down on  GOCCs  that pay lip service to his order.<br><br>Government has no monopoly on  the “gimme  syndrome”,  writes  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sun Star</span>  columnist  Melanie Lim. She delivers  concise  eight-point rules for  people who wring arms for presents, bitch  about them and  never  say <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">salamat</span>. <br><br>Don’t ask,  even if others do, Lim counsels. Don’t  complain. “This is not a business transaction,” but a voluntary gesture of the giver. “Some fear we may  run out of  presents.”Never, but  never, demand that a gift be reserved. There’s email, text,  twitter, etc. to  give thanks. “Surely, your mother taught you some manners.”<br><br>“Call me old fashioned.” But  to  spell out  what  present you want, unless asked, is a no-no.  Squelch the  itch to whip out  your wish list, unless the prospective  givers  ask. ”The absolute worst thing” is to return a gift and demand another one. <br><br>“What is it about the holiday season that makes people, otherwise courteous,  especially shameless when it comes to gifts?,” she wonders. “Is it a thing of this generation? Or  just inability to sift  right from wrong, after so many years of doing the wrong thing?”<br><br>Don’t  greet  passengers  “Merry Christmas,” airport  staff were told. They’ll think you’re panhandling. Just smile. How poor the country that handles Yuletide greetings with forceps. <br><br> “Christmas is a necessity,” the late CBS  reporter  Arnold  Eric Sevareid mused. “There has to be at least one day in  the year to remind us that we’re here for something else beside ourselves.”<br><br>Perhaps nothing reflects   Sevareid’s  insight   better than the  1906  O. Henry  short  story <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Gift of the Magi.</span><br><br>O. Henry was  William Sydney Porter’s pen name. Anecdote has it  that  he  scribbled the story on ruled paper, between swigs, at  Pete’s Tavern in New York City. A waiting  copyboy  handcarried  the draft,  page by page, to a waiting editor. <br><br>The story line is simple. James  Dillingham Young and wife Della, who live in a warren-like apartment,  are broke. Neither can afford to shop for a gift on Christmas Eve.<br><br>Della sold  her knee-length  brown hair to a wig maker. Secretly, she buys Jim a chain for a  prized pocket watch,  inherited from his grandfather.Unknown to Delia, Jim sells  his watch. He then purchases  a  set of combs, made out of tortoiseshell, for her hair.  <br><br>Disaster? Let O. Henry  tell it:  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“The magi, as you know, were wise men – wonderfully wise men – who brought gifts to the new-born King of the Jews in the manger. They  invented the art of giving Christmas presents.  Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“In a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the Magi.”</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br>After fleeing Nazi rule  in her native Norway,  Nobel  Laureate (1928)  Sigrid  Undset   rephrased  O Henry’s insight into  a three paragraph note: <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“And when we give each other Christmas gifts in His name, let us remember that He has given us the sun and the moon and the stars, and the earth with its forests and mountains and oceans  --  and all that lives and move upon them. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“ He has given us all green things and everything that blossoms and bears fruit and all that we quarrel about and all that we have misused..  And to save us from our foolishness, from all our sins, He came down to earth and gave us Himself.”</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Time and time again, each one is reminded to decide to know ourselves and act according to what makes us happy. <br><br>Traditionally, Christmas season is time to be happy because as Christians, we renew our commitment to follow the two main commandments: Love God above all else; and Love your neighbor as youself.<br><br>As Christmas time occurs at the end of the year, it also coincides with the time to reflect on the past, treasure the present, and find hope in the future.<br><br>The “eat” portion should be over after New Year. Filipinos know how to party and make a feast complete with cholesterol-laden lechon or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">humba</span>. <br><br>But the essence of “breaking bread is to rekindle the bonding of family and friends, renew our spirit of connection with our loved ones, both here or abroad. This is our way of letting them know that they have a special place in our hearts.  However humble is the meal, the food not only fills the stomachs but also warms the heart. People see each other differently after they partake of a meal.<br><br>The “pray” portion actually is an ongoing mission, accented by the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Misa de Gallo</span> for Catholics, services for other churches, with the same aim, to raise to the high heavens, our yearnings for good health, whole families, progressive and united nation under responsible leadership. <br><br>Self actualization of any person begins with the fulfillment of basic needs-food, clothing and shelter, and for most Filipino, this is a continuing prayer. <br><br>Civic groups, charitable individuals, and religious associations have tried to answer these prayers by sharing gifts, meals or just to commune with those who have less.  <br><br>This is not a meaningless gesture, but an act of prayer from a grateful heart. <br><br>This year, the Rotary Club of Dumaguete-Mother Club led by President Nehru Yurong, gave gifts to the inmates of the City Jail as a token of  assistance in their journey towards rehabilitation, a reminder that once rehabilitated, they can be productive citizens if they abide by the law.<br><br>The “love” portion is the most challenging of all because  you can only love if you  love yourself, and this love is reflected on how you relate to others. <br><br>One who is greedy is exemplified by one public official who abuses his position to obtain money, power and influence, this person does not have love. <br><br>Any act of corruption erodes the humanity of the person himself, and when multiplied by many in a society, it dehumanizes a whole nation. It will facilitate the return to a survival of the fittest mentality, descend into chaos, as seen in countries like Sudan and Haiti. <br><br>This is so sad because if only we have love, it will be easier to act human.

   "body": "<BR>Gov. Agustin Perdices is sporting a new look: he no longer wears his big eyeglasses, thanks to the cataract surgery two months ago that dramatically improved his eyesight.<BR><BR>His 76-year-old body, however, is taking a little while longer to recover.  Weakened by the effects of treatments for stomach cancer, Perdices ambles along with an accessory—a cane--while his aides walk beside him, ready to give a hand at the first sign of difficulty.<BR><BR>So far, Perdices has gone through six of 12 scheduled chemotherapy sessions.  Meeting the press for a Christmas get-together last Wednesday, this writer engaged the governor in a personal one-on-one while everyone else was having lunch. <BR><BR>“How are you,” I ask. “I’m improving slowly,” he says in a voice louder than a whisper, “but you know that in this condition, anything can happen.”<BR><BR>“How’s your spirit--are you upbeat?” “The effects of chemotherapy weaken my body but I’m inspired by the many people who wish me well and pray for me.”<BR><BR>“Do you pray harder now?” “I guess every person in this kind of crisis would pray a lot more than he usually does. But I leave it up to God. He has the answers and I am at peace.”<BR><BR>Leaving his fate to God, however, hasn’t stopped Perdices from asking the most pressing question of all-- “I usually ask Him--Lord, now that you have made me Governor, why are you in a hurry to take me?’”<BR><BR>Do you consider your stint in Dumaguete as your best years? “Those were the longest years,” he said of his 19-year stint as City Mayor of Dumaguete starting in 1988, interrupted only by a three-year hiatus due to the ban on a fourth consecutive term.<BR><BR>Perdices’ father, Mariano F. Perdices, also served as Mayor of Dumaguete and later on moved up to become Governor of the Province of Negros Oriental. This inspired the younger Perdices to also aspire for the governorship, although the highest post he had won in an election was for the vice-governorship.<BR><BR>Unlike the relatively easy political victories Perdices had in his years as Dumaguete City mayor, Perdices won a tight three-way race for vice-governor despite the absence of support from any incumbent elected official.<BR><BR>As destiny would shape it, Perdices was thrust to the coveted position of governor after Gov. Emilio Macias II succumbed to liver cancer on June 13, barely two weeks before he could be sworn into office. <BR><BR>Perdices has lived his life the way he wanted to live it, so much so that if he were to live life over, he said he would still vie for the governorship.  <BR><BR>“But would you have run for governor earlier?” “Not if Dodo [Macias] was around. I wouldn’t run against him but I would allow him to finish his term.”<BR><BR>Despite their petty political bickerings and maneuverings to get to the top elective post in Negros Oriental, Macias and Perdices had always professed a friendship that goes back to their mischievous childhood days when, in Macias’ recollection, they would run after passing trucks carrying sugarcane and steal one or two stalks for a quick sweet fix. <BR><BR>In his first speech as governor last June 30, Perdices had vowed to perpetuate the legacy of Macias. “I will never forget the reality that it was my good friend, Gov. Emilio Macias II, who was elected to office. I am only filling in for his unexpired term,” Perdices said in his extemporaneous address.<BR><BR>Still, Perdices remains upbeat about beating the odds. “I have no illusions of running again in the next election; I just want to finish my term.  And I hope to see you again next Christmas!”<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html<BR>",

   "body": "<BR>Noreco 2 Chairman James Fontelo has scored the administration of the Municipality of Sibulan for what he said was spending excessively on job order employees to the detriment of the town’s obligation to pay its utility consumption.<BR><BR>In an interview, Fontelo said the town had been in the list of delinquent power consumers for its unpaid electric bill of around P650,000 covering a three-month period. <BR><BR>“That’s my observation. There’s too much politicking going on in Sibulan,” Fontelo, who had served Sibulan for 27 years as councilor and vice-mayor.<BR><BR>He said he had reminded the municipal treasurer about the town’s unpaid electric bill, adding that as a Sibulanon, he wouldn’t want the town to be without electricity, especially at Christmas time. <BR><BR>At least four government buildings had been scheduled for electrical disconnection before Christmas.<BR><BR>The Municipal Council was expected to settle its electric bill to beat the December 23 deadline after passing a supplemental budget.<BR><BR>For her part, Sibulan Mayor Marcela Bartoces belied Fontelo’s statement, saying all local government units, for that matter, experience a tight fiscal position towards the end of every year.<BR><BR>“It is not correct to say that the job order employees are the reason for the delay in the payment of the Noreco 2 bill because we have also many projects and programs.<BR><BR>In a telephone interview, Bartoces said that the electric bill of the Municipality had already been paid out of the savings of the local government unit. “We not only paid our electric bills but we also paid our fuel bills and our teacher aides in addition to giving cash gifts for our personnel,” she said.<BR><BR>She said that job order employees, or employees employed on project basis, number around 200. Some of these employees, she said, serve as short as two weeks, some serve a month or two months. “We try to rotate their services so that we could accommodate as many job-seekers as possible,” she said.<BR><BR>The Municipality of Sibulan has an income of P82 million, inclusive of the P65 million yearly counterpart from the national government in the form of Internal Revenue Allotment.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>When Foundation University says it means business, this is not just empty rhetoric.  Figures over a 15-year period show that the University walks the talk.<br><br>From a mere investment of P105,761 for the upgrading of school facilities in school year 1994-1995, the University had been steadily plowing back millions of pesos into improving the campus buildings and grounds, buying land and equipment, which reached P22,041, 131.18 in school year 2008-2009 alone.<br><br>“We’re a non-stock, non-profit and non-sectarian University so whatever financial margin we make goes back into improving the campus,” said Victor Vicente G. Sinco, vice president for finance and administration.<br><br>The goal of the entire makeover, he said, was to create an academic environment. “It is supposed to be transformative to a point that you think about something but not to the point of being annoying,” he said.<br><br>Sinco, who spends half his time as an architect based in Hawaii, has also been responsible for redesigning the entire campus starting in 1996 when he started visiting his father, Leandro, who came two years earlier to be university president.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Changes</span><br></div><br><br>        “I came three times in 1996 and in 1997 did some sketches. The library was the first building to have minor renovation. The second one was the social garden, which used to be the volleyball court. The grade school was the third project,  followed by the College of Law,” Sinco recalled.<br><br>The grade school joined the High School at the North Campus, where all sports activities were also based. “We had to get rid of all the sports here and transferred to the north campus to create a real academic environment on this side,” Sinco said.<br><br>As the University couldn’t afford to cool all the buildings with air conditioners, Sinco brought back tropical designs and provided better ventilation. He made larger windows, larger eaves and put fans in every classroom.<br><br>“In the 60s, the buildings were nice. But in the 70s and 80s, some changes were introduced and some buildings became ugly.  So I just removed the changes and brought them back to the original design and then some,” Sinco said.<br><br>The university also acquired 3000 square meters of land by the North Campus to convert what was the College of Agriculture’s demonstration farm into a ballfield.<br><br>The University gymnasium was added in 1998.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Boom</span><br></div><br><br>        As the improvements could not interfere with classes, work had to be perfectly timed, which was a surprise for many students and faculty alike. Dr. Lilian Sumagaysay, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and acting dean of student affairs, could hardly believe her eyes. “I was shocked by what I saw--in a semester’s time, the Arts building was transformed from a one storey building into a three-storey building!”<br><br>But working with whatever money was available left much to be desired. “When my father was alive (the elder Sinco passed away in 2003) we had one major improvement every year,” Sinco said. “With the introduction of the development fee, we could come up with two or three improvements because the money was available.”<br><br>The convocation hall was renovated out of borrowed money and the mini-gym beside it was transformed to the IT Center in 2004.<br><br>For Dr. Eva Melon, the university vice-president for academic affairs, the campus of today is a different one she first saw in 1975. “We didn’t have what we have today. Our parade grounds then were very brown. Now they’re green.”<br><br>As an administrator, Melon also saw the improvement in the university’s communications system.  “There were only two phones back in 1975. We had to stand outside a building to speak on a phone that was passed through a window. With the introduction of the IT phone system in 2005, we suddenly had one phone in each department. We even have four Voice-over Internet Protocol (VOIP) lines and a 1-800 number!”<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Information Tech</span><br></div><br><br>        The fully internet-connected and WiFi campus made inter-personal communication a lot easier.  Paperless communication became the norm with email. Enrolment procedures have also been simplified with the online kiosks.<br><br>Now, the university is using information technology to harness their students’ potential from grade school to graduate school.<br>In my class, I ask my students if they prefer the traditional method of teaching or if they prefer to meet online, said Dr.  Julhusin Jalisan, dean of the College of Business Administration and faculty of the Graduate School.<br><br>“If they prefer to do online classes, all they need to do is to log in within the week,” he said.<br><br>The push for IT, Sinco said, is inspired by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) system, which not only has their courses online but also their reading assignments.<br><br>In some areas, Sinco said FU is at par with US universities, though may be behind in some areas.  “But we’re not different from other universities in the Philippines.”<br><br>Sinco said FU is building its physical plant on the digital side to expand its borders. “It would probably be cheaper for the students who are far from the university because they could save on transportation costs.”<br><br>“We are looking at online education but we just have to find a way to identify the users,” Sinco said.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Renaissance</span><br></div><br><br>        The Foundation University Renaissance, as the improvements initially introduced by the late Pres. Leandro Sinco are called, is indeed changing many ways of doing things on campus.<br><br>Multimedia classrooms are in place. “These are more than audio-visual rooms,” Sumagaysay said, “there are digital overhead projectors so teachers don’t need acetates--they just put the books under the camera and the image is flashed on screen. There are three multimedia classrooms in the AS plus two more at the James Herring multi-media center.<br><br>“The traditional way of teaching before was everything was in a classroom, lecture and lab. Before the only labs we had were the science labs. Because we created more labs, we ran out of classrooms so we had to move out of the buildings,” Sinco said.<br><br>He said that at the rate the University is adding more laboratories, it won’t be long before they run out of classrooms.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Restrooms</span><br></div><br><br>        The university also takes pride in its spanking clean and odorless restrooms, which have convinced not a few students to make Foundation University their school of choice.<br><br>The restrooms used to smell so bad, Sinco recalled. “We tried all sorts of things. We came out with water saver devices and flushers for the urinals and it helped. But part of the problem that we couldn’t fix was the vandalism--we were finding sandwiches in the toilet tanks and napkins were placed wherever there was a hole.”<br>One day, Sinco thought of having the restrooms painted. He showed Hersley-Ven Casero, a talented student who now teaches at the Department of Fine Arts, of the work done by a Hawaiian artist and he tried it.<br><br>The result was expected -- vandalism had been reduced to a minimum level. “If people know that Hersley has a personal hand in the restrooms, there’s no vandalism,” Sinco said.<br><br>Each restroom has a different theme and to ensure that it’s kept clean with a continuous supply of soap, water, toilet paper and is adequately ventilated, students pay a subsidy of two pesos for the posting of a working student outside the restroom.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Security</span><br></div><br><br>        For the moment, the University uses an RF id system which requires students to swipe in and out.  But Sinco says he is still on the lookout for WiFi RF ids that will enable the school to locate people on campus.<br><br>“The ID card,” Sinco explained, “is supposed to be a smart card. The parents may load it with money which the students may use to transact at the cafeteria or the business office,  but we haven’t done it yet. We don’t have to change the program anymore. We just add to it.”<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Future</span><br></div><br><br>        IN THE PIPELINE ARE MORE BUILDINGS IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO ACCOMMODATE MORE LABORATORIES AND CLASSROOMS. SINCO EVEN HAS A DREAM OF ESTABLISHING A 20-HECTARE CAMPUS IN THE TOWN OF VALENCIA. “IT’S DOABLE. WE JUST HAVE TO DO IT IN SMALL BITES AT A TIME.”<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

This is because aside from the 25 MW that Green Core is supplying, Noreco 2 also has a 12 MW standby deal with Korean-owned Keppco for peak hours while holding on to a promise from Napocor for a 41 MW supply until December 2011.<BR><BR>“We submitted our intent to Napocor for the 41 MW but we are not sure if they can supply us with the needed power because the Leyte facility could also be privatized within the year,” said a Noreco 2 source who declined to be identified.<BR><BR>Ricky Tantoco, president of Green Core’s parent company Energy Development Corp., said the contract signing between Noreco 2 and Green Core is a product of discussions which started in January and was reinforced by the power summit conducted by the NOBDF, NOIPC, NOCCI last August. He said after word got around that Noreco 2 was signing up with Green Core, other electric cooperatives also scrambled to get in line.<BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html<BR>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA -- Gov. Agustin “Tuting” Perdices is a changed man.  He is burning.  He is possessed with a burning desire to live with enthusiasm.  Now that his body is 76 years old, harried by time and cancer, Tuting talks with confidence and conviction of finishing his three-year term.  The confidence he anchors in God, the conviction his own.  After what he calls his “touch-and-go” moment at the hospital, he is a man possessed with the passion principle as he holds the governorship as a gift from God.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward.  It is the Lord Christ you are serving (Colossians) 3:23-24).</span><br><br>That is how, in effect, Tuting has assessed his life situation at a year-end conference in the presence of the Dumaguete Media.  Little did I know, that in that press conference, he has given the Negrenses a priceless Christmas gift.  I only have had an inkling when I began to think, reflect, and write this column.  What struck my eye easily were the photo-ops after the press-con.  What stuck in my mind is the frame wherein Tuting had the photo-op with the beautiful ladies of the Dumaguete Media.  This reminds me of his tale about his father Gov. Mariano Perdices.  While interviewing him at City Hall, he told us that once as a young man he chanced upon his Dad having a conference with a bevy of beautiful young women at his office.  He thought mischievously as any normal passionate young man would do, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“unsa kahay gihunahuna sa gulang karon.</span>”  When I visit Dumaguete again next year, I will have the opportunity to ask him what’s the difference.  Scent of a woman.  What is the difference to the young, to the old?  I know I now smell the roses and embrace my wife in a new way.<br><br>Whether by coincidence or by cosmic design, under Tuting’s stewardship the provincial government approved the construction of Helix Spire to serve as a modern technological Christmas Tree at the Sidlakang Negros this year.   Shade of Jacob’s Ladder with images of angels descending and ascending to Heaven.   If for a moment we convert it into a Conic Spire, we will have a fair idea of a geometric figure with the greatest circle at its base and smallest at its apex.  The shrinking radius from the base all the way up to the apex tells the story of man not conformed to this world but is transformed by renewing his mind as he spirals his way to Heaven.  When young, he is  wild.  It is a badge of honor to be rebellious. He strays away as far as he may from the center, away from God.  Gratifying the self is all that matters.  Young is forever.  Young is immortal.  Until he grows old or stares at death’s face.   He realizes he is not in control after all.  God is in control.   Then he may make a turnaround in the way of the shrinking radius until he is one once again with the Creator from almost a lifetime of alienation.  <br><br>No fear now even if he is counting his numbered days.  No regrets.  Tuting, unlike Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman in a movie, has no complicated Bucket List.  The move tells the story of two terminally ill men who escape from a cancer ward and head off on a road trip with a wish list of to-do’s before they die, before they kick the bucket. The movie stars’ bucket list includes skydiving, Mustang driving, pyramid-climbing, flying over the North Pole, eating dinner at Chevre d’Or in France, visiting the Taj Mahal in India and the Great Wall in China, and going on a lion safari in Africa.<br><br>Tuting goes for the matter of the heart, no socially prestigious bucket list for him.  He is getting it right with God. Like us he has marginalized God as Jesus was marginalized at His birth.  There was no space in the public Inns, only a manger for Immanuel.  He is now putting God at the center.  He made the confession during a year-end presscon at the provincial capitol.  He said it in a few words. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Karon nga gihimo mo akong gobernador, nganong dali ko nimong kuhaon.”</span><br><br>One day at a time, Tuting is seizing the moment to fill it with love in reaching out for the marginalized.  The provincial government has just acquired two cargo trucks to bring farmers’ produce from the hinterlands to the poblacion and city markets.  More important than the material benefits is the love and care that the provincial capitol is extending to the poor farmers and their families who are marginalized by the peace and order problem.<br><br>Tuting hopes to stamp that trademark in his remaining days--a love fellowship with his people as manifest of his love relationship with God.  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Carpe Diem, Carpe Deum.”</span>  That is a matter of the God-shaped heart.  There ought to be a heart of any human-conceived matter--a stewardship of righteousness, a reality of the heart.  <br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>I’ve been living here in Dumaguete for almost two years now, and frankly, I have yet to see a Filipino TV show that can actually entice me to watch it without boredom or anger. Either you watch news that tends to scare the heck out of every citizen, or a variety show of some kind (I call them halo-halo shows) that mostly exploit those who are desperate to be laughed at on national television, or drama shows that torture the emotional instability of every romantic.<BR><BR>Now, I like gossip stories as the next gal.  But, are there any substantial Filipino local shows that encourage viewers to think, be challenged and or inspired without sentimentality? Please, give me some substance alongside the silliness.<BR><BR>Yes, there are few local TV shows that create a serious forum of some sort, which allows the public to participate both in the studio and in the comfort of their living room.  Here in Dumaguete, Silliman U. has a channel that actually shows a programs featuring significant discussion not only relating to student affairs but also general social concerns. What’s nice about this program is that it gives various points of view from different people, young and old, professionals and students. I believe that  the public is hungry for solutions and alternatives, instead of just insipid rhetoric that we all recognize as meaningless.<BR><BR>Let’s take the television news in this country for instance. Yes, they report the news with a certain amount of added sensationalism (which seems to be the norm nowadays -- even CNN does the same). The question is, what is newsworthy aside from the drama of gory pictures and details of some murder, or rumor mongering about some celebrity’s vapid life.  The news being reported is so stylized, creating dramatic effects, trying to sell a story and to capture the audience’s attention. It’s very rare to hear local television news that actually deal in substance and provide something from which people can actually learn.<BR><BR>How about those variety shows that run for three-hour marathons? What exactly is the point of these shows? Is it to entertain the public by humiliating the participants on national television, forcing them to try to gain sympathy from the viewers through personal revelations? What exactly are we suppose to learn from this? I say nothing, but I’m sure many will disagree with me. They will say that the show makes them laugh and forget their worries. Perhaps it does, but then what? After the show is over, have people actually learned from it?<BR><BR>Worse are the “soap operas” or the “dramas” that are being shown during the day and in the evenings. Are they really entertaining?  Where is the originality?  Where is the uniqueness?  Is there actually a demand for these kinds of shows from the public? Maybe I’m totally alone and off base in my view. But I say, if there are better alternatives, perhaps at some point it will create a buzz and hopefully get the audience to demand better TV programming.<BR><BR>If the purpose of art is “to delight and to instruct” as Horace wrote, and since television at its best is an art form, should we at least come up with programs that not only can entertain but also teach us how to think and can inspire the soul?<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

He was 76.<br><br>Perdices served as Dumaguete City Mayor for 19 years before he was elected as Negros Oriental Vice Governor last May 2010. But as fate would have it, he was thrust to the governorship with the death of Gov.

He was about to have his seventh session when his condition suddenly worsened last Monday.<br><br>Lawyer Neil Ray Lagahit, Dumaguete City Legal Officer and Perdices' legal adviser for 10 years, said Perdices was surrounded by his family and trusted aide Harrison Gonzales at his bedside.<br><br>Lagahit, accompanied by Perdices’ personal lawyer Myles Nicolas Bejar, flew to Manila Tuesday upon hearing of the Governor’s deteriorating condition. “We just wanted to see him alive,” Lagahit said.<br><br>When he got to the hospital Wednesday morning, Lagahit said he saw that the Governor was having difficulty breathing.<br><br>He was bleeding faster than the blood transfusion, Lagahit said.<br><br>“I told him ‘Gov, thank you so much for everything.’ After that, he would no longer talk. He would just murmur and use hand signals to give instructions.<br><br>“Then[Dumaguete] Mayor [Manuel Sagarbarria] called me to relay to the Gov. his gratitude for everything he had done for us. Perdices replied, ‘OK. Can’t talk phone.’<br><br>“At 12 noon, I bade him goodbye. But he couldn’t talk because he was gasping for breath. He looked at me and in a faint voice, said ‘OK Bim, pag-ayo ayo. (take care)’<br><br>“I turned to walk away but I was called back. He exerted tremendous effort and strength to raise his hand to call me again. He told me, ‘OK Bim, pag-ayo ayo.’<br><br>“I told him, Gov, you fight. Everyone is expecting to see you in Dumaguete. And he nodded and said, ‘pag ayo-ayo.’<br><br>That was the last time Lagahit saw him alive.<br><br>Mayor Sagarbarria described Perdices’ death as a great loss for Dumaguete. “He had served us for the last 19 years. We just have to accept the news. We are asking the family to hold at least a one-day wake at City Hall,” he said.<br><br>Sagarbarria said that in all his nine years as a politician, he would go to Perdices occasionally to ask for advice. “He was very calm and gave good advice. He was very fatherly. He never knew how to get angry. He was our next door neighbor but he was more of a barkada to my elder brothers.”<br><br>For his part, Vice Governor Roel Degamo ordered flags to fly at half mast all over the province, as he assured that he would continue the projects of Gov. Perdices.<br><br>Degamo would take his oath of office as Governor of Negros Oriental at 8 a.m. on Thursday before RTC Executive Judge Fe Lualhati Bustamante.<br><br>First Board Member Apolinario Arnaiz Jr. will also take his oath as the new Vice Governor of the Province.<br><br>Perdices' remains will be flown in on Friday afternoon on the Philippine Airlines flight.

Emilio Macias II to the remaining members of the Provincial Board of Negros Oriental, after three members of the provincial legislature died one after the other in the first quarter of 2010. <br><br>The first fatality in the Provincial Board was Apolinario Arnaiz, Sr., 84, who was chair of the Liga ng mga Barangay. He had cancer but he succumbed to cardiac arrest on February 17. <br><br>Five days later, during Arnaiz' funeral, word came that Board Member Melimore Saycon died from massive internal organ bleeding. He was 69. <br><br>On March 26, the first day of the local campaign period, Board Member Rudolfo Martinez died in a motorcycle accident near his home in Tayasan town. he was 56.<br><br>It was in Martinez' funeral that Macias made his appeal. \"We don't have too many Board Members to begin with,\" he continued.<br><br>But the shadow of death continued to hound the Provincial leadership. Right after his successful reelection bid during the May 2010 elections, Macias, 76, had himself examined at the National Kidney Institute. His doctors put him on an aggressive regimen to combat liver cancer.<br><br>Macias expired on June 13--one month to the day he was admitted--and his remains were immediately cremated. Vice Governor Jose Baldado assumed as Governor for the last few days of Macias' unexpired term and Board Member Mariant Escano-Villegas moved up to become Vice Governor.<br><br>On June 30, Vice-Governor-elect Agustin Perdices, 75, took his oath of office twice--first as Vice Governor and five minutes later as Governor of Negros Oriental through the principle of succession. Number one Board Member Roel Degamo likewise became Vice Governor.<br><br>From being Mayor of the 30 barangays that comprises Dumaguete City for 19 years, Perdices was suddenly faced with the overwhelming task of managing 557 barangays. On his first week in office as Governor, he once sneaked back to his former office at the City Hall to escape the pressure. \"There are so many problems at the capitol!\" he was heard as saying.<br><br>Gradually, however, Perdices felt the need to be somewhere else other than his office, saying he felt he was burned out. He was getting weaker, he noted.<br><br>Finally, he went for a consultation at the St. Luke's Medical Center, where he was told that he had stage 3 cancer of the stomach. He broke the news to his constituents in early November, after he celebrated his 76th birthday.<br><br>In the days that followed, the reins of leadership at the Provincial Capitol would swing back and forth between Perdices and Degamo, as Perdices had to be in Manila often for a series of chemotherapy sessions.<br><br>Likewise, in the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, Board Member Apolinario Arnaiz Jr. would also be presiding officer whenever Degamo became acting Governor. Perdices celebrated Christmas in Dumaguete, taking a break halfway through his 12 chemo sessions. In his public appearances, Perdices reiterated his wish that since God allowed him to become Governor, he would be given time to finish his three-year term. But in the same vein, he also announced that he was ready to accept whatever God had planned for him.<br><br>By Wednesday morning, word got around through text messaging that Gov. Perdices' health had worsened. Prayers were uttered in several public functions. <br><br>Finally, at 5:15, the inevitable news came. Perdices was gone.<br><br>\"The Governor,\" said his long-time lawyer Neil Ray Lagahit,\"had served the city and the province well without any taint of corruption. He fought the good fight and that is enough consolation for all the people of Dumaguete and Negros Oriental.\"<br><br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: #2708ff; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;\">Related stories:</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index193.htm\">- Gov.

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>One of the unfortunately issuances of then president Joseph Estrada was Executive Order 81 he signed on March 5, 1999, which transferred the management of the Palarong Pambansa from the Department  of Education to the Philippine Sports Commission.<br><br>In the company of less than a dozen teachers who shared my sentiments, I marched and demonstrated in Mendiola objecting to the issuance of the EO. For some five years, I kept up the campaign by wearing a black t-shirt with the message: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ibalik ang Palaro sa DepEd</span>, whenever there were occasions I thought appropriate to demonstrate, such as the Palarong Pambansa in Naga City in 2004. <br><br>In 2005, then president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo through EO 443 ordered back the management of the Palaro to the Education department for reasons which can be gleaned from this exchange of email between me and PSC chairman Richie Garcia, triggered by a news item appearing recently reporting that the PSC will once again take over management of the annual school games. <br><br>Here are excerpts I downloaded from the several online broadsheets including <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Cebu Daily News:</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“The idea of the Philippine Sports Commission taking over the Palarong Pambansa again sounds great—except that it would be a gargantuan problem if not sufficiently budgeted. PSC chair Richie Garcia said the agency faced a financial dilemma years ago when the country’s premier multi-event meet for elementary and high school athletes was transferred from the Department of Education.</span> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Garcia was a commissioner of the agency when the PSC was tasked with running the show during the presidency of Joseph Estrada. ‘We had financial problems back then, so I hope when the PSC takes over the Palaro, the allocation will be included,’ said Garcia.”</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">But Philippine Olympic Committee President Jose “Peping” Cojuangco Jr. is again pushing for the PSC takeover of the Palaro to make it a vital component of the agency’s grassroots development program. Cojuangco said national sports associations should exercise direct control over the running of their respective events in the Palaro. He added that the NSAs’ hands-on involvement would boost the country’s search for new talents who would then be included in the developmental pool for the national team. ‘The Palaro has no use if the NSAs are not involved,’ said Cojuangco. ‘There’s no continuity in the progress of these athletes after competing in the Palaro.’”</span><br><br>As DepEd director of PE and sports during the incumbency of Presidents Marcos, Aquino, and Ramos, I was directly involved in the management of the Palarong Pambansa. Noting the misconceptions of Garcia and Cojuangco regarding the management of the games, I sent on Jan. 3 this email to the former and two of his commissioners, Jolly Gomez and Akiko Tompson-Guevarra:<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I read today the plan of the PSC to take over the management of the DepEd Palarong Pambansa. May I advise you against it for the following reasons:</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">1. The Palarong Pambansa is DepEd’s laboratory for their PE and School Sports program. It is where its athletes are identified and trained, where their coaches and PE teachers find the opportunity to exercise their professions. Depriving them of this experience will curtail their own professional development and advancement.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">2. The PSC does not have the field personnel to undertake the implementation of the various multi-level components of the Palaro: school intramurals, district meet, division meet and regional meet. You only see the national Palaro but fail to see the lower level components. As the DepEd people say: “Kami na nag namunla, nagtanim, nagani, nagbayo, nagsaing, naglatad ng pagkain para kumain lang ang PSC?” Think about that.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">3. It seems that the PSC wants to take over the Palaro provided that funding is provided. In other words, the motivation of PSC is to get funds. The DepEd, in case you forget, is awash with funds this time around. They can just tell you to take your money for all they care. The DepEd people can allocate P30 to P50 million from their budget and hold the Palaro and you will be out of the picture.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">4. I received several text messages just now telling me about your plan and asking me to help them convey to you their concern: that Monico Puentevella is again behind the plan when in fact, it was he who convinced then DepEd Secretary Bro. Andrew Gonzales to turn over the Palaro to PSC...and again through his intercession, when noting the incapability of the PSC to do the job, was instrumental in returning the Palaro to DepEd for the 2005 Palaro in Iloilo. They said they perceived this intent of Puentevella during the recent PSC national conference.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">5. Also, that Peping Cojuangco is pushing for the same. Please note that Cojuangco’s argument that the PSC and POC should have control of the Palaro to have continuity is fallacious. Why do I say this? After the Palaro, whoever will manage the games, the talents are identified and are turned over to the NSAs to train and develop. What control and continuity is Cojuangco talking about? The Palaro is a process that starts in the schools, up to the Palarong Pambansa. Can the PSC and POC handle the training and preparation of the athletes down at the school, district, division and regional levels when it does not have the people to do this? Kaya ang sabi ng mga DepEd who texted me: Ginagago lang daw sila ng PSC and POC. That’s a serious allegation which can create animosity between the PSC and the DepEd.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I share you these information/perceptions for whatever they are worth, and because I want the sincerity which the PSC Board is now manifesting, something I can sense to put in place a culture of transparency in the way you run the Commission. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Your efforts to create a sense of transparency could be futile at the way you are pursuing to take control of the DepEd Palarong Pambansa and asking funds to do it when everybody knows the PSC can’t do it due to lack of organizaion.  </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">By the way, when PSC was managing the Palarong Pambansa, it utilized the services of NSA people instead of the DepEd teacher-tech officials. Guess what happened? The motivation of NSA people being different from teachers, they went along with officiating the games at the early stages. When the final round was to start, these people started asking for higher pay and threatened they will not officiate unless they were given the remuneration they demanded. In all the history of the Palaro, that never happended. Only when PSC using NSA personnel took over officiating chores. </span><br><br>Here’s an excerpt from chairman Garcia’s response.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“I am with you regarding the Palaro.  It is too big for PSC to handle. I am not for it, and will not ask for it.   I was a commissioner during the time that it was given to PSC, and I honestly think it was a mess.  If it is mandated that the Palaro will be given to us, then we will just have to do our best and try to make the best Palaro.  </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">You are right about the Palaro that it is not just the games. It is the training in schools and the regional, and everything that makes the Palaro...</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Thank you for the advice on this.  We will just do our job and work on what is good for our athletes and what is good for Philippine sports. Richie.”</span><br><br>I hope and pray the conflicting motives of the PSC chairman and the POC president regarding the management of the Palarong Pambansa will be reconciled. As I said, Let’s Keep the Palaro with the DepEd.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

We often read reports on battles between guards of wildlife sanctuaries and forest poachers resulting in loss of human lives. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Philippine Daily Inquirer</span> (Dec. 27, 2010) headlined the hazards faced by forest guards and officials of the Department of Environment & Natural Resources while performing their duties to protect the rapidly- diminishing original forests of the country. <br><br>In general, the public is not aware of the hazards to which foresters and forest guards are exposed while performing their field duties. The report should evoke not only sympathy for the families of victims, but also better understanding of the conditions under which DENR forest law enforcers work, and willingness to extend various forms of assistance to them.   <br><br>According to DENR Secretary Ramon Paje, forest protection workers are often threatened, harassed, and killed while performing their duties. <br><br>The newspaper account mentioned that more than 50 forest workers have lost their lives, and another 50 have been injured in line of duty since 1990. <br><br>Some of these deaths occurred when I was at the DENR in 1992-1995 during our campaign against large-scale, illegal cutting of forest trees in two regions of the country, Region 2 and Region 10 (which included the CARAGA region at that time).  <br><br>Apparently, illegal logging continues to this day in the two regions based on several reports.<br><br>These killings, which amount to murder, should not be taken lightly. Government must be ready to respond to the evil deeds of greedy people who are out to profit from our common natural resources without thinking of the dire consequences of their acts. They have to be brought to justice.  Government must exercise this responsibility. <br><br>In addition, ways to protect and preserve our remaining tropical rainforests must be found. One key to the search for lasting solutions could be the forest communities themselves, which are the immediate beneficiaries of forest resources.  <br><br>Community-based management is well known, and has worked well in coastal communities. But the potentials of this approach have not been fully utilized by governments, local and national, for some unknown reasons. <br><br>There must be some ways to make community-based forest management work successfully, provided government is willing to make initial investments in providing forest communities with non-forest livelihood opportunities. These communities can work with local government units in the enforcement of forest laws and regulations. <br><br>The other key to the solution of forest conservation problems is the use of available communication technology that would facilitate communication and reporting of forest law violations and quick identification of the violators.<br><br>Still another key would be the quick administration of justice. This would involve prosecutors and judges. We had good cooperation from prosecutors in the adjudication of illegal logging cases during our stint at the DENR in 1992-1995.  <br><br>The use of armed forces and the police is often recommended, but we know this can work if sparingly used, and only in exceptional cases requiring the interventions with firearms. <br><br>We must use persuasive means through effective information, education and communication (IEC) programs in winning people to our way of thinking, in this case, forest conservation.  <br><br>In such programs, People’s Organizations and NGOs have been used in the past, and maybe more can be persuaded to engage in forest conservation programs together with local government units under the overall responsibility of the national government. <br><br>Political influence can be a plus, or a minus as our experience in marine conservation tells us, and care must be exercised in using it for purposes of forest conservation. <br><br>Skilled community organizers would be in better positions to make wise decisions whether to use political influence or not.<br><br>The fact remains that our tropical rainforests and the biodiversity resources in them are under high pressure from people who want to make money from our forests. <br><br>As already known, the small remaining original forests of the country are only a small fraction (ca seven percent) of what they were at the beginning of the 20th century in terms of area occupied.<br><br>There is no need here to further justify the view that the forest remnants must be preserved at all costs if we want to see this country progress over the years ahead.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

El Nido reefs once  had   60-70 percent coral cover that supported flourishing marine life. But the 1997-1998 El Niño  bleached coral cover down  down to five to 10 percent. <br><br>Up to now, El Nido has not fully recovered after the devastating coral bleaching event. “Nationwide, the 1998 coral bleaching event decreased live coral cover by as much as 49 percent.  <br><br>The sea surface temperature  in Bolinao, Pangasinan, ranged between 34.1 °C to 34.9 °C. That  savaged  clusters  of giant clams. “ The altered chemistry of warmed  sea water also trigger algal blooms. The resulting “red tides”caused red tides, as well as fish kills. <br><br>That is devastating for  a country where more than half (51.8 percent) of fishing households live below the poverty line, former NEDA chair  Cielito Habito pointed out. That’s double the “overall  national poverty incidence ( 26.9 percent). <br><br>“Fishermen in Western Visayas and Mindanao are generally poorer compared to those in other regions,” adds Ateneo de Manila’s Roehlano Briones.<br><br>One of the more  significant   studies is Global Climatic Risk Index of  2011. Compiled annually over the last 19 years, it  reveals the Philippines ranks  seventh, among 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change. <br><br>Drawn up  by Germanwatch, the  list  wedges the Philippines between Haiti on one end, and the Dominican Republic on the other. We are among the top 10 countries most exposed to disastrous climate change impacts. <br><br>CRI analysis  is anchored on  “quantified impacts of extreme weather events”.The list is confined to  countries that signed up  with  the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.<br><br>Over  almost two decades, the Philippines suffered an average of  821 deaths yearly. Climate-related damages  ratcheted to US$ 684 million. The index reveals the country  suffered the maximum deaths  from extreme weather conditions in 1991. Maximum damage was inflicted in 2008. <br><br>The Philippines  landed  in the top 10 of climate risk index since 2006. Other countries dubbed as “most vulnerable“ include Bangladesh, Myanmar, Honduras, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Haiti, India, Dominican Republic, and China.<br><br>The  index  supplements  the 2007 Greenpeace report <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Philippines: A Climate Hotspot</span>. It  forecasts sea-level rises and pinpoints 64 out of the 81 provinces as vulnerable. A  “conservative one-metre rise in sea level could  compel  1.5 million Filipinos to seek higher ground.”<br><br>Sulu and Palawan are pinpointed as  the two most exposed provinces. Others are Northern Samar, Zamboanga Sibugay, Basilan, Cebu, Davao, Bohol, Camarines Sur, and Quezon.<br><br>From an international perspective, “ocean swelling” could well swamp countries Tuvalu and Nauru in the South Pacific and Mali in Africa. “Sea level rise is so terrifying, people just don’t want to think about it,” says Marshall Islands Jorelik Tibon.<br><br>The earth’s polar caps and other frozen areas, meanwhile,  are in retreat. But the thinning Arctic sea ice does not explain why the world’s major cities – New York, London and  Frankfurt – shiver  through  colder winters. <br><br>Turn our attention instead to the snow in Siberia, suggests  Judah Cohen in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">New York Times</span>.  Seasonal snow cover increased across  high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, especially in Siberia. <br><br>’The high topography of Asia,  the jet stream, the sun’s energy pushes cold air south from the Arctic on the east side of the Rockies. Cold air from Siberia spills south into East Asia and even southwestward into Europe. <br><br>“That is why the Eastern United States, Northern Europe and East Asia have experienced extraordinarily snowy and cold winters since the turn of this century,” even as the globe warms.<br><br>Filipino politicians don’t think about such issues for different reasons. Most are ecological illiterates. This intellectual bankruptcy explains a dearth of local initiatives. It is an invitation to suicide.<br><br>“The sheer number of people being  dessicated, drowned, or displaced,” Worldwatch Institute cautions, “stresses the need for understanding that ecological issues are central to the future of human life.”<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>As we entered the New Year, we were jolted by the news that  Gov. Agustin “Tuting” Perdices  passed away.  <BR><BR>While his demise did not come as a surprise in view of his struggle with stomach cancer, it brought profound sadness and loss. He just served less than a year of his term, albeit most of it spent in the hospital. He left a legacy of  dedicated public service and his motto: “I want to be known for my deeds.” Our prayers for his eternal rest and condolences to his bereaved loved ones.<BR><BR>Now that that  the position of governor is vacant, Acting Gov. Roel Degamo  is stepping  into the position, by way of succession. <BR><BR>Life goes on, as the mode of succession is provided for by law. This new administration is really a departure from expected transitions because this is the first time there has been  two successions to the position of Governor in a span of less than a year. <BR><BR>Tuting was elected vice governor in May 2010, but  took over as Governor when Dodo Macias died in June 2010. Then Degamo, who was elected as Board Member, took over as vice governor, and now, is Governor.<BR><BR>Will these have an impact on the ordinary man on the street? It depends, but there are positive signs the legacy of the past governors will  steer the Province in the direction, it will be taking.  The delivery of basic services, such as health related programs, should be prioritized. <BR><BR>Recently, Mayor Chiquiting Sagarrbaria announced his program aimed at bringing health services to the barangays, in response to an urgent community need.<BR><BR>It is important to note that UNICEF reported that a total of 38 percent of Filipino children die of diarrhea and acute respiratory  infections.  The report was based on a study by the World Health Organization and the World Bank. <BR><BR>Pneumonia, one of the diseases associated  with acute respiratory infections, is  responsible for up to two million child deaths each year. It highlighted the finding that malnutrition plays a contributing role in more than half of child deaths.  <BR><BR>Recently, there had been an outbreak of cholera in Alegria, Cebu,  manifested in the form of sever diarrhea, due to the presence of E. coli in their water supply. <BR><BR>Did we check our water supply regularly this rainy season? The rains and the cold front brought an increase in flu and respiratory related infections, hence, the need for the provincial government to take note, and make the health centers, district and provincial hospitals ready to respond to a possible increase in patients. <BR><BR>Cong. Henry Pryde Teves declared his intentions to upgrade the institutional, personnel and physical capability of Bayawan District Hospital.  <BR><BR>Cong. George Arnaiz has regularly extended his medical missions, and aid to needy hospital patients in this District, and had worked with the programs for the Provincial Hospital. <BR><BR>Cong. Josy Limkaichong made health as the centerpiece of her programs. Thus, while resources of government are limited, it is reassuring that our political leaders have prioritized health.<BR><BR>With the step in the right direction, and a unified approach to the delivery of basic services to the people, there will be new beginnings, towards a better, more prosperous New Year.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

The people here are doing their best to enjoy themselves. <BR><BR>But for the young man in the middle the enjoyment seems forced; his expression is more a grimace than a smile. The man on the left seems to be off balance, dancing alone, and in the background a small group of people trudge around with downcast looks.  Only the couple on the right seem to have any real feeling for the occasion, or for each other.<BR><BR>This season is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, the weather is cool and windy; people can be warm and close without perspiration; charity and forgiveness can bloom. There are vacations, family reunions, drinking and feasting every night. Children are happy and quiet at night, waiting for Christmas day and Christmas gifts. <BR><BR>Of course all this costs money, more than many ordinary people can afford; and so they often begin their new year heavily in debt.  Still, it’s only once a year, and they’re willing to make the sacrifice to keep their families and their children happy.<BR><BR>But for anyone but children, the season can bring another kind of sadness. For  adults,  Christmas is often bittersweet: it celebrates a great birthday of hope for the world, but it also celebrates the ending of the year, and brings out memories of the past. <BR><BR>People look back to what they hoped for in the last year, and in all the years before. Whatever they may have gained or lost in wealth or resolution, they have certainly lost another year of time. Lost wealth can be replaced, but lost time cannot. They remember that every year gone is one year less left.<BR><BR>They see children, breathlessly waiting for Christmas morning to grant them all their dreams. They remember that feeling, how strongly it came to them at Christmas every year; and they know the time when it has come more than it will come again.<BR><BR>The people in this picture, dancing- they’re very young, but they’re not children anymore. They enjoy this time of celebration, but behind their surface smiles they know this season, with all its happiness and all its memories comes only once a year, and it’s already enough. Afterward, when it’s over, going back to normal life is happiness too.<BR><br><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport1-9.jpeg\"><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

And sure, we have all been to other dinners thrown by assorted friends, and perhaps we can even say we have had the time of our lives over good food and fine wine and splendid conversation in them. But when I think of throwing dinner in the way I think of fine art, I think of Arlene’s. She defines it.<br><br>Sometimes, with others, the food does not offer much in terms of adventure, just the usual staple of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">bam-i</span> and fresh <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lumpia</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lechon manok</span> and what-not, but the company is nevertheless merry, and there is plenty of beer for the dressed-down lot. <br><br>Sometimes, the banquet may be an orgy of taste—but the mix of guests is not right, and the night ends up with people in little cliques, each one ignoring the other, with all wrapped up in their own little worlds. <br><br>Sometimes the host may just be a little too uptight for comfort, or is the illustration of a social disaster of such chatty proportions without the grace <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">and</span> the fierce and quiet intelligence needed to make a good evening feel even better. <br><br>Sometimes the place is too oppressive for the necessary vibes to get a party going. And sometimes, everything just plain goes wrong—the rain comes, the electricity goes out, the music is horrendous, the chef is missing, the wine is bad, the dog has run away with the turkey, the guests come in flip-flops to a formal dinner. <br><br>Dinner-giving is not a perfect science. It is almost all intuition, with lots of room for good luck. But Arlene seems to know a thing or two about how to make an evening memorable. She plans for it the way a painter sees the outlines of a story on a blank canvas. They are always about something, or for someone. “Let’s throw a party for Marvin and Kuya Bodjie,” she would say. Or: “Let’s do a little Balinese theme, just for friends.” Or: “Let’s look at the blue moon in Mampas.” <br><br>Then she would invite a local chef of some renown to plan and execute the menu. One time, it was Patrick Chua—otherwise known as the city’s best orthodentist—and his glorious and inventive <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">paella</span>. Another time it was an Uypitching cousin fresh off a culinary school from somewhere else in the world. <br><br>Giving good dinners takes practice and time. It also takes a venue that lends itself well to flowing conversation and the orgiastic partaking of delicious food. It also takes a large enough personality that attracts an uncommon crowd, a capacity for imagination that requires dazzle but with a Martha Stewart restraint, and an uncanny sense of chemistry that is able to ascertain a killer guest list and their ability to sustain each other in interesting talk.<br><br>For Christmas Eve, Arlene threw a small dinner for friends at the house she shares with husband Don in lower Valencia, an extensive estate done with an unmistakable Balinese sensibility and aesthetics. It has spots suitable for intimate gatherings. We’ve done dinners here before, sometimes alfresco. <br><br>For this night, she turned a big garage—<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">a garage!</span>—into a kind of Christmas wonderland, with choice picks of linen and comfortable furniture and holiday draperies and candles and carefully designed soft lighting. On one side, she assembled a dining set arranged in a square with a donut hole, which accommodated a jolly bundle of Christmas décor consisting of angels and poinsettia and what-not—with none of the garishness you will find in that other Christmas pit-stop in town. On the other side, she had appointed a lounging area ready for the after-dinner wine-drinking and comfortable boozy talk, and beside it she placed a live Christmas tree filled with 33 candles, which the Colburn and Uypitching kids lit up as dinner progressed to dessert. We played Christmas songs all night.<br><br>Ritchie Armogenia—of KRI and Likha—was the chef for the occasion, and he had a promising menu for us—herbs-encrusted <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">maya-may</span>a with mustard and basil butter, linguini with shrimp roasted in garlic and chili, Brazilian beef tournedos with potato croquetas and rosemary demi-glace, and finally, a roasted turkey with gravy. It was a banquet to forget diets away.<br><br>Mister Donuts’ John Colburn appointed himself the bartender for the night—and was passing everyone a delicious concoction he called chocolate patron martini, composed of tequila rose and a wisp of Baileys, then garnished with grated chocolate truffles. <br><br>“I’m going to give you something else,” he told me when I walked over to the makeshift bar. “This is my cranberry vodka delight,” he said and proceeded to prepare it in front of me. “First, you put in ice,” he said, and into the shaker went in some cubes. “Then you put two ounces of vodka. And then some Old Orchard cranberry juice. And then a touch of Malibu for the coconut taste. And then a little rock and roll.” He shook the entire mix, then poured the contents into glasses for me and another friend. “Then here’s the lemon wedge around the lid, to accent the drink. This is the key. It brings out the flavor,” he finally said. And it was a refreshing drink, subtle in its kick, just the way I liked it, the coconut flavor biting in at the last of every sip.<br><br>John’s wife, the irrepressibly charming Justine, made sure the party flow proved dynamic and fun. (And I have to say this: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">what I like best about Mister Donuts is the Mrs.)</span><br><br>And the guests—which included Don’s father and mother, his brother Ngo An and wife Maresa, Esther and Heinz Windler, the artist Karl Aguila, the Davao writer Aaron Jalalon, the photographer and painter Hersley-Ven Casero, and Student Universe’s head honcho Antonio Quiogue and his husband Jeremy Schmoll—proved equal to the merriment. We went beyond small talk into a kind of spell only intimate gatherings can provoke. <br><br>And to that, we toasted ourselves a merry Christmas, and toasted Ritchie’s merry spread, and toasted friendships old and new.  <br><br>See pictures at <a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index273.htm\">Uypitching holiday party pictures</a><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Agustin Ramon Perdices Friday, two days after he succumbed to stomach cancer Wednesday in a hospital in Taguig City.<BR><BR>The remains of Perdices were brought home by his family on board the afternoon flight of Philippine Airlines after a two-night vigil at the Sanctuario de San Antonio in Makati City. <BR><BR>The Perdices family was welcomed by government officials led by Cong. George Arnaiz and Gov. Roel Degamo, city and municipal mayors, personal friends of Perdices, soldiers, policemen, government employees, Rotarians, scouts, and ordinary citizens.<BR><BR>From the airport, the hearse bringing Perdices’ casket proceeded at a slow pace toward Dumaguete City, trailed by about 50 Boy Scouts walking behind it. The hearse stopped at the St. Paul University of Dumaguete, the late Governor’s alma mater, where he also served as Trustee. <BR><BR>After prayers and songs from the students, teachers, administrators and alumni, the convoy proceeded to the Capitol, passing by crowds of people waving white flaglets and hand-written placards expressing their affection for their beloved leader. They also threw red and yellow flowers on the hood of the hearse.<BR><BR>Others chose to wait at the Provincial Capitol, where chairs and tents had been arranged outside for the two-day vigil. Msgr. Gamaliel Tulabing, judicial vicar of the Diocese of Dumaguete, celebrated mass at the Capitol lobby after the casket arrived.<BR><BR>On Sunday, the remains of Perdices will be transferred to the Dumaguete City Hall by noontime, where it will lie in state for two more days. <BR><BR>The final necrological mass will be held on Tuesday at 2 p.m. at the Dumaguete Cathedral Church, to be followed by the interment at the Dumaguete Memorial Park. Perdices will be laid to rest beside the tomb of his wife Ma. Eugenia Araneta-Perdices.<BR><BR>News of the Governor’s death which spread like wildfire before 6 p.m. last Wednesday shocked Dumaguetenos and Negrenses alike, as Perdices seemed he was getting stronger when he was in Dumaguete last December. <BR><BR>He had already completed six of the 12 chemotherapy sessions. <BR><BR>After hearing of the news, Vice Gov. Roel Degamo, who was acting governor, arranged for his oathtaking to be held the following morning of Thursday, together with that of Board Member Apolinario Arnaiz Jr.’s as vice governor.<BR><BR>However, Rep.

   "body": "<BR>“Please stop dying.” <BR><BR>This was the half-joking appeal of then Gov. Emilio Macias II to the remaining members of the Provincial Board of Negros Oriental, after three members of the Provincial legislature died one after the other in the first quarter of 2010. <BR><BR>The first fatality in the Provincial Board was Apolinario Arnaiz Sr., 84, who was chair of the Liga ng mga Barangay. He had cancer but he succumbed to cardiac arrest on Feb. 17. <BR><BR>Five days later, during Arnaiz’ funeral, word came that Board Member Melimore Saycon died from massive internal organ bleeding. He was 69. <BR><BR>On March 26, the first day of the local campaign period, Board Member Rudolfo Martinez was killed in a motorbike accident near his home in Tayasan town. He was 56.<BR><BR>It was in Martinez’ funeral that Macias made his appeal. “We don’t have too many Board Members to begin with,” he continued.<BR><BR>But the shadow of death continued to hound the Provincial leadership. Right after his successful reelection bid during the May 2010 elections, Macias, 76, had himself examined at the National Kidney Institute. His doctors put him on an aggressive regimen to combat liver cancer.<BR><BR>Macias expired on June 13 -- one month to the day he was admitted -- and his remains were immediately cremated. <BR><BR>Vice Gov. Jose Baldado assumed as Governor for the last few days of Macias’ unexpired term, and Board Member Mariant Escano-Villegas moved up to become Vice Governor.<BR><BR>On June 30, Vice-Gov.-elect Agustin Perdices, 75, took his oath of office twice -- first as Vice Governor, and five minutes later as Governor of Negros Oriental through the principle of succession. Number one Board Member Roel Degamo likewise became Vice Governor.<BR><BR>From being Mayor for 19 years of the 30 barangays that comprise Dumaguete City, Perdices was suddenly faced with the overwhelming task of managing 557 barangays. <BR><BR>On his first week in office as Governor, Perdices once sneaked back to his former office at the City Hall to escape the pressure. “There are so many problems at the Capitol!” he was heard as saying.<BR><BR>Gradually, however, Perdices felt the need to be somewhere else other than his office, saying he felt he was burned out. He was getting weaker, he noted.<BR><BR>Finally, he went for a consultation at St. Luke’s Medical Center in Manila, where he was told he had Stage 3 cancer of the stomach. He broke the news to his constituents in early November, after he celebrated his 76th birthday.<BR><BR>In the days that followed, the reins of leadership at the Provincial Capitol would swing back and forth between Perdices and Degamo, as Perdices had to be in Manila often for a series of chemotherapy sessions.<BR><BR>Likewise, in the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, Board Member Apolinario Arnaiz Jr. would also be presiding officer whenever Degamo became Acting Governor. <BR><BR>Perdices celebrated Christmas in Dumaguete, taking a break halfway through his 12 chemo sessions. <BR><BR>In his public appearances, Perdices reiterated his wish that since God allowed him to become Governor, he would be given time to finish his three-year term. <BR><BR>But in the same vein, he also announced that he was ready to accept whatever God had planned for him.<BR><BR>By Wednesday morning this week, word got around through text messaging that Governor Perdices’ health had worsened. Prayers were uttered in several public functions. <BR><BR>Finally, at 5:15 pm, the inevitable news came: Perdices was gone.<BR><BR>“The Governor,” said his long-time lawyer Neil Ray Lagahit,”had served the City and the Province well without any taint of corruption. He fought the good fight, and that is enough consolation for all the people of Dumaguete and Negros Oriental.”<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

His siblings are Gina Estrella, Ronie, and Roderick.<BR><BR>Roel Degamo studied and finished his primary education from Pio Macahig Memorial School in Siaton starting in 1972 until 1978. His high school days from 1978 to 1982 were spent at St. Louis School in Calindagan, a Catholic school ran by the CICM Fathers.<BR><BR>He spent the years 1982 to 1989 as an Engineering student at Silliman University where he earned his BS in Mechanical Engineering degree. After his graduation, he took and passed the licensure examinations for Mechanical Engineers given in 1989.<BR><BR>He once worked as a driver at ROW-NORSA of the National Power Corp.; mechanic/driver of PB 207, CIP; then senior plant mechanic and Electrical Control operator of PB 107, Palawan-Napocor; and finally, as acting PEC of Palawan-Napocor.<BR><BR>As destiny would have it in 1998, Roel Degamo got himself involved in politics.  His is a classic case of the cliche “If it’s really meant to be, it was meant to be.”<BR><BR>His political career started when he was elected as councilor in the municipality of Siaton from 1998 to  2007.  He became president of the Provincial Councilors League-Negros Oriental Chapter from 2004 to 2007, which gave him a seat in the Sangguniang Panlalawigan as representative of the PCL.  <BR><BR>He was also elected as Region VII chairperson of the PCL, which entitled him a seat in the National Board of the Philippine Councilors League. <BR><BR>In 2007, he ran and was elected as one of the three regular members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan representing the 3rd legislative District of Negros Oriental. <BR><BR>In the May 2010 local and national elections, he overwhelmingly won again as one of the three members of the Sannguniang Panlalawigan for the 3rd District (from Valencia down to Basay). The votes he garnered ranked him as the Number One member of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. <BR><BR>Thus, Degamo assumed as Vice Governor after Vice-Governor-elect Agustin Perdices assumed the gubernatorial post left by elected Gov. Emilio C. Macias II who died before the formal oath-taking ceremonies.<BR><BR>The death of Gov. Agustin Perdices on Jan. 5, 2011 has forced Degamo to again move up the political ladder, this time to that of Governor.<BR><BR>Roel Degamo is married to Janice Mira Vallega from Pamplona,  Negros Oriental, an English teacher at the Negros Oriental State University-Siaton. They are blessed with a son, Carlo Remontal. <BR><BR>“I know there are a lot of experts out there. I am willing to listen to good advice,” Degamo said, adding that he is a fast learner and is ready and willing to give this job his best shot.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>A special court to exclusively try and hear drug cases has meted out a total of 68 convictions in Dumaguete last year, with 20 of them serving life imprisonment and fined P500,000 each.<BR><BR>RTC Branch 30 Judge Rafael Crescencio Tan, in his annual report, said his court also acquitted 32 drug suspects and dismissed cases against 10 others.<BR><BR>Tan said those convicted to jail terms of more than six years have been brought to the Bureau of Corrections in Muntinlupa City or the correctional Institution for Women at Mandaluyong City.<BR><BR>The Judge said the main reason for acquitting 32 of the suspects was because there was reasonable doubt as to their guilt, considering that there was failure of the arresting officers to give the accused the so-called Miranda warnings, the failure of the seizing officers to immediately mark the dangerous drugs seized at the crime scene, the failure of the prosecution witness to corroborate their respective testimonies resulting in their lack of credibility, and the failure of the arresting officers to comply with Section 21 of R.A. 1965, among others.<BR><BR>With 124 new cases filed before the RTC Branch 30 last year, the total number of pending drug cases has increased to 304. <BR><BR>However, Judge Tan said this figure is lower than the 338 pending cases as of Dec. 31, 2009.<BR><BR>Five cases were archived during the year 2010 as the accused where nowhere to be found, in spite of the warrants of arrest issued for the accused, Tan reported.<BR><BR>Last year, the RTC Branch 30 disposed of an average of 13.5 cases per month, or 1.22 cases every two working days. <BR><BR>Judge Tan said this case disposal rate is higher than the ideal Supreme Court ratio of one case disposal for every case filed in court.<BR><BR>RTC Branch 30 was presided over by Judge Marie Rose Inocando-Paras during the first six months of 2010, while Judge Tan returned to the Court during the second semester of the said year.

   "body": "<BR>Bayawan City Councilor Victoriano Alabastro survived an assassination attempt last December 31 when the assassin's gun jammed twice, reports reaching Dumaguete City said.<BR><BR>Two motorcycle-riding hitmen approached Alabastro, the interim vice-president of the Philippine Councilor's League for the Visayas, as he was having his car washed along Peping Gamo St. in Bayawan City at 2 p.m. of New Year's eve. A report said the backrider pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the councilor's face and squeezed the trigger, but the gun jammed. The gunman cocked his gun again  but the gun was still jammed, said eyewitnesses, enabling Alabastro to slap the gunman's wrist, yanking the gun out from the latter's hand.<BR><BR>Alabastro called for backup and police tried to pursue the assassins who had abandoned their motorcycle and fled on foot. Police recovered the motorcycle and identified the owner through its expired registration papers but they declined to reveal the owner's identity pending results of follow-up operations. <BR><BR>Alabastro said the attempt against his life in broad daylight is an insult to the police force in the city who are supposed to protect its citizens. \"These people do not respect our policemen because they believe that they can easily escape after committing a crime,\" he told Bayawan City employees during Monday's flag-raising ceremony.<BR><BR>He also said he believes that he was just lucky and that God did not allow him to die. \"If the gun went off, I may not be here in front of you today,\" he added. Alabastro, however,  declined to comment on the identities of the possible assassins or  brains behind the slay attempt. He, however, said that the attempt on his life must be job-related and it could easily be seen that the act was premeditated.  <BR><BR>\"Obviously these people are not from Bayawan City because they wanted to harm us,\" he said. <BR><BR>Alabastro called on the people to report whatever information they have regarding bad people roaming in the city so that they can be apprehended.<BR><BR>In the same flag-raising program, Bayawan City Mayor Rene Gaudiel also condemned the slay attempt against Alabastro as a cowardly act and an insult to his leadership. \"The act is counterproductive and would put Bayawan City in a bad light. Bayawan has been known as a progressive City but this incident is not good for us,\" he said.<BR><BR>According to Gaudiel people have no right to play judge or God and take away lives of people who they have a grudge against. He called on the police to create a task force to investigate the attempted murder of Councilor Alabastro.<BR><BR>Alabastro was the City Legal Officer of Bayawan City during the incumbency of former Mayor German P. Saraña.  He ran for City Councilor in 2004 and was reelected as number one councilor in 2010.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

He is thrown into the present without self.  His past is a dark shadow.  His records have been erased. Nothing much to anchor on for his present course of action.  Except the acquired skills of a trained assassin and the inborn trait to read the mind of his enemy. Not knowing whether he is heel or a hero, an oppressor or a savior out to assassinate or save a well-beloved world leader.  Without knowing who he is, he loses the power of choice.  His eyes have become a mere camera just recording without interpretation.  His eyes are bereft of his own face.

It is another year-long season, another circle, another orbit of our lives.  It is another time for a New Year’s resolution.

Neutrinos from a massive solar flare increase the Earth’s core temperature triggering the colossal disasters with peoples like ants scampering barely surviving in the persons of 400K superior human breeds who have been chosen to board the Arks.

We want to get in control.

We forget that Yahweh breathed life to a cold mold of dead clay--the reality that our origin, our source, our breath of life comes from the realm of the Spirit.  Things in this world are time-bound.  They pass away.  As created beings in time past we are just memories, today--a pretentious vapor, and tomorrow--a shimmering haze in the horizon.<br><br>Babylon!  A word.

As the mercenary Toorop, Vin takes a high-risk mission to escort (a genetically-modified Mary) Aurora from a Noelite convent in Russia to give a virgin birth in America.  Her father is a cybernetic genius, her mother a high priestess of the Noelite religion. While still a fetus, Aurora’s father using advanced medical techniques enhanced her brain with a supercomputer.  The genetic modification enabled her to speak 19 languages at two years old.  Though growing from a baby to womanhood in the convent, she knows how to operate an old model Russian submarine, knows that a caged tiger is a clone, read one’s intention, anticipate danger, and tells that she is pregnant with twins.  She has the brain of a supercomputer.  Yet she is very caring and compassionate the exact opposite of her mother the High Priestess who is scheming to establish the primacy of the Noelights with the modern day virgin birth. Her mother knows only the light of the blinding blaze of power, fame, and fortune dawning on her on Miracle Day, the day Aurora is to deliver her virgin-birth babies.<br><br>Things a-changing.  Times a-changing.  The more they remain the same.  How many generations have come and go, how many years have come and go since the birth of the God-man?  Round and round the season goes, round and round generations roll over one after another.  It is the windmills in our minds, the battle over the mind, the never-ending battle of good against evil.

Clone, stem cell, genetically modified organism (food), test tube baby, cybernetics, and plastic surgery are now within the grasp of modern man.  Yet human nature remains essentially evil.  The great leap forward in scientific and technological advances is mainly used to serve mankind’s vanity and greed for power which spawn lust, corruption, and violence.<br><br>Everything boils down to our lost identity--an eye w/o I.  Without realizing who we are in Jesus and what we are, we lose our bearing and direction as human beings.  <br><br>In the state of grace, our weakness is made perfect in Jesus if we choose to let the Holy Spirit in-dwell in our hearts knowing well that we are God’s children.  In this Yuletide season and the breaking of the New Year, may we bear the nine-fold fruit of the Spirit.  May we journey through the year with love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

The sooner we accept this, the better.  At the end of the day, it is only the Lord who offers us unconditional love and constant presence. It is therefore wise to put our absolute confidence only in him.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"> <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Power </span><br></div><br><br>        We are not invincible. We were never designed to be such.  There is a limit to what we can accomplish.  There is line we must draw between what we can do and what God’s power alone can fulfill.  Only when that line is drawn can we push the boundaries of common sense and truly learn to walk by faith.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">    <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Pain</span><br></div><br><br>        Pain strengthens faith and builds spiritual stamina.

Let us all declare a fresh word of faith in our hearts that by the grace of the Lord, new doors of opportunities shall open.  Things do not have to remain the same.  By the grace of Jesus, let us brace ourselves for exciting endeavors we never thought we could do and for new adventures that will strengthen our relationship with God like never before.<br><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">    Process</span><br></div><br><br>        Until the day we breathe our last, we shall never be complete. It’s not wise to think we are “made” or that we are “done.” There are still mountains to conquer and valleys to endure. It is dangerous to rest on our past glories and previous conquests.  When we start thinking this way, we become passé and irrelevant.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">    <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Praise</span><br></div><br><br>        An attitude of gratitude towards God can go a very long way.

I take this with dispassion. It does not matter, I tell myself. And somewhere in the fathoms of me, I smile with a firm nonchalance I’ve taken at this idea of exquisite solitariness surrounded by holiday tinsel and cheer. <br><br>Of course, when I mention this to people who ask me where I will be for Christmas Eve, I get a look of passing pity, and I know exactly what they are thinking: the holidays are designed for rituals of gathering, and I am the oddball that elicits—what? Pity? Suspicion? I do my best to allay their misgivings. “The thing is, my mother is in Los Angeles,” I tell them, “This will be my first Christmas without her—and I doubt I shall be sharing <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">noche buena</span> with the others in my family.”<br><br>(My second Christmas, actually. Years ago, when I knew no better, I spent a solitary Christmas in the dark snowy nighttime of Hokkaido in Japan, where there was no Christmas—and there, at the approach of midnight, in the silence that begat only more silence, I cried myself to sleep. How amusing that young man seems to me now, so brittle with worry and want.)<br><br>So yes, I tell them that my mother is somewhere in the sunny wonderland of Los Angeles. When we—the family, which means all my married brothers and their families and I—would gather for <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">noche buena</span> on the 24th of each December, it was a familial exercise we did for her. She demanded it. <br><br>But we are such an unsentimental family in many ways. All of us have flown the nest, and to assuage our guilt of having donned so much of Western traditions in the habits of family, we would march to Mother’s place in Bantayan, go through the motions of staying, eat her feast, and before the fireworks threatened to make the highways impassable with noise and smoke and the smell of burnt sulfur, we would kiss her goodbye and goodnight, and off we would go to our individual lives. <br><br>We don’t do gifts. I don’t remember anybody in my family ever giving me, or each other, Christmas gifts as a matter of course. (Except one time, my brother Edwin once bought me a computer, when I was a kid.) We give gifts randomly throughout the year, but as a Christmas tradition, no. <br><br>I do remember making my sister-in-law Daisy a mixed tape once, a recording of Meryl Streep reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034J3G0U?ie=UTF8&tag=dumagumetrop-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0034J3G0U\">The Velveteen Rabbit</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=dumagumetrop-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0034J3G0U\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />. I do remember the occasional manito/manita, but never as a rule. This has been my kind of Christmas for years. Quite unsentimental, which has taught me well. <br><br>Of course, we make an effort to sweeten it with Christmas songs and decorations and a good feast, perhaps even snapshot opportunities with smiling faces, but…<br><br>“But surely,” they will continue, “you’re spending the holidays with others in your family.”<br><br>“Well, my brothers are everywhere, some place else. Switzerland. There are two in Los Angeles. The ones in Dumaguete—they have their own families to share this Christmas with.” Without the fulcrum that is my mother, it feels remarkably odd to even consider.<br><br>“Cousins?”<br><br>“I don’t want to bother them.”<br><br>“Oh my.”<br><br>“It’s all right, really.”<br><br>I don’t blame them their worry. I know where it comes from. I’ve been there. Some of my best memories of Christmas involve a halo-halo of family and friends and the magic that sometimes happen when you put together people who truly care for each other in a room or a house. Some accidental merriment is bound to ensue. <br><br>One time, it was my eldest brother Rocky, fresh from Cebu, deciding to shower us kids those gold 25 centavo coins, all shining and newly-minted. We raised such merry ruckus, all that laughter and elbowing and everything else. <br><br>Another time, my brother Edwin took all of us on a trek to a department store downtown, and told us: “Choose the best Christmas tree in the store, the one you want.” The merchandise was made of plastic, of course, but it was our first Christmas tree after years and years of poverty—and its huge size and its possibilities for decoration overwhelmed us. We brought the tree home to our old house in Sibulan, decked it with ornaments and light. When it finally twinkled, we gathered around it, like it was a beacon of so much hope. <br><br>I was a kid in most of these memories. But Christmas is different when you’re young. It has an inner, throbbing magic for children. When we grow up, we are forever exiled from it, possessed only with the inescapable feeling that Christmases past were always better, shinier. The things we have left are our nostalgia.<br><br>Nostalgia will not be in the cards for me this year. I stake my claim on that alone-ness, that beautiful solitariness. But I don’t mean to make it sound sad: the word “alone” carries with it a universe of ennui—and there’s massive literature out there that has mapped out the word to contain our endless capacities for the morose and the dramatic—and so perhaps the right phrase to use may be “spending it by my lonesome”. In either case, the number is singular. And I shall take that fact with an embrace.<br><br>It is a beautiful thing to embrace. It has taught me quiet. It has taught me to appreciate the rare moments of togetherness when they do happen out of the kinetic order of the world, and not out of habit or force. It has taught me to pray. I shall thank my unsentimental family for all that. In a sense, this is the best Christmas gift they’ve ever given me.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Raymund Mercado, governor, Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Negros Oriental</span><br><br>Go out personally to the municipalities, and look at what they need.  Prioritize projects that benefit the most number of people.  Buying vehicles for Board Members is not a useful expense.  Farm-to-market vehicles for farmers is good; which can double as emergency vehicles for the constituents.  <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">– Christy Locsin-Bollos, proprietor, Plaza Ma. Luisa Suites   </span><br><br>Please work hand in hand with the Church in our efforts towards moral recovery.  Businesses should contribute to the holistic development of the Province; not only for financial progress but for moral and spiritual [progress] as well.  Work for genuine human development.

Cang, proprietor, Cang’s Shopping Complex </span><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><br>Establish strong connections with the NGOs.  Create a venue wherein the NGOs and the concerned government agencies can exchange ideas and possibilities for networking.

I wish him the best of luck.  <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">– Atty. Bentham dela Cruz, Amlan municipal mayor</span><br><br>It would be too presumptuous of me to advise Governor Degamo, considering I’m just a City official.  Governor Degamo has served the provincial government for years, and I’m sure he knows what is expected of him as leader of the Province, and what he has to do.  All I could do is offer help in case he has projects of the good of Dumaguet City.  I wish him the best of luck.  <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">– Atty. Alan Gel Cordova, Dumaguete City vice mayor</span><br><br>My best advice is for us to leave him be, and allow Roel to do his job.  <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">– Leo Mamicpic, Friends of the Environment in Negros Oriental</span><br><br>Seems like Gov. Roel Degamo is not yet equipped with the required personality profile and expertise of an effective executive.  While on the job, he will need somebody beside to mentor him on personality and intellectual development.  The likes of Dr. Henry Sojor or Dr. Rico Absin could serve as advisers.  Someone has to teach him to gain more self-confidence and firmness of character to be able to impose strength in leadership, and maintain control in the job. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"> – Lino Enojo, employee  </span><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><br>My simple advice to our new Governor is to value the virtues of humility, honesty, integrity, dedication, and genuine commitment to public service.  The real challenge is to become an exemplary public servant, and continue to raise the standard of politics in our Province, just like what our late Governor Tuting and Governor Macias did during their time.  Adhere to the call for great governance, and strive to transform Negros Oriental to greater heights by making significant strides in good governance and economic development reforms. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"> – Cong. Josy Sy-Limkaichong, 1st District representative </span><br><br>Seek counsel from successful and highly-respected community members.  <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">– Baby T. Armogenia, proprietor, South Sea Resort</span><br><br>From what I’ve read from <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kitang Lungsuranon sa Siaton</span>, Siaton’s local newspaper, Governor Degamo had a good start in life, and formed good values as he was growing up (e.g. self-discipline, hard work).  His goals in leading the Province, symbolized in the acronym HELP (Health, Education, Livelihood, Programs & Projects), are commendable.  I want to say then, continue walking with God, listen to His counsel, and keep the faith. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"> – Lorna Pena Reyes-Makil, retired sociologist </span><br><br>Stay fit.  The Capitol has got all sorts of problems.  <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">– Pinky Gloria-Lautner, language professor, businesswoman, tourism advocate </span><br><br>Please continue the legacy of good and honest governance of the previous administrations.

   "body": "<BR>In our material world, things are perceived as real when they are seen or felt with our senses. <BR><BR>This is especially true of scientific predictions of natural events. We faced this difficulty when we set up the program of marine protected areas way back in the 1970s and 1980s. <BR><BR>At that time, we had preliminary information that protection results in the increase of fish abundance and biomass after few years of protection. <BR><BR>From this information, it was easier and logical to predict that fishing communities would benefit from increased fish catches, following protection through what is known as adult fish spillover. <BR><BR>We also predicted that as a consequence of improved marine biodiversity, marine reserves would attract tourists who are able to pay user fees, thus, enhancing livelihood sources for coastal communities. <BR><BR>We all know that both predictions, which have been included in our papers published in the decades 1970s and 1980s, have actually happened. <BR><BR>The only prediction that has not been demonstrated, although it is certainly happening, is that marine protected areas would produce larvae and juveniles that can replenish the adults being fished out in both natal reef sites and far away reefs. <BR><BR>This larval spillover termed recruitment spillover is one hidden benefit of no-take marine reserves.<BR><BR>Let me go back briefly to our experience in the past when only few people realized the need for marine protected areas. I must remind our readers that the idea of marine protected areas originated from a private scientific organization, hence, less constrained by government bureaucratic procedures and open to innovative ideas and actions. <BR><BR>In our work, we adopted the strategy of local community involvement in coastal resource management, often referred to as community-based resource management. <BR><BR>Although this approach tends to be slow because it requires community organization that facilitates full community participation and involvement, in the long run, it is more advantageous compared to centralized approaches that have been shown to be ineffective in the country. <BR><BR>One result of the community approach is that in the selection of protected sites to be established, too often the sites agreed to be protected were really not the best sites, as recommended by theoretical marine reserve experts, because these sites were decided on the basis of compromise in regard to the area of the site and the quality of biodiversity and fishery resources. <BR><BR>From the standpoint of local communities, I can understand this behavior, which amounts to reserving the best sites for fishing. <BR><BR>Yet, even with this limitation, our research carried on at SUAKCREM indicates a substantial larval recruitment that could sustain over time the marine resources in the Bohol Sea, where there are at present more than 60 marine reserves maintained by local communities. <BR><BR>In brief, there are benefits of fully-protected marine reserves beyond the obvious benefits that are easily seen or observed. This is the reason why I have been steadfast in suggesting that the establishment of community-based no-take marine reserves is the way to go forward to ensure the conservation of our marine resources. <BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>CEBU CITY --  “Let us not seek to fix the blame for the past,” John  F. Kennedy  counseled.  “Let us accept our own responsibility for the future.” <br><br>President  Barrack  Obama  re-echoed that  theme after  a psycho in  Arizona  shot  Rep. Gabrielle Giffords,  killed  five and injured  13.  <br><br>“What we  can’t do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on one another,” Obama   said. Despite polarized politics, resist the itch to “speak words that wound”.  Choose instead those “that heal”.<br><br>Here, presidential  spokesperson Edwin Lacierda  didn’t resist  the lure. It came in Heritage  Foundation’s release of its  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">2011  Index of  Economic  Freedom</span>.  <br><br>Pervasive corruption, a flabby judiciary, and  unsound   policies sapped the Philippine economy. As a  result, we limped  in as 21st out of 41 nations measured in Asia and the Pacific. That’s  lower than  our already cellar status  the year before. “The  Philippines is saddled by “one of the mostly unfree economies,” the Index concluded.<br><br>Index indicators are anchored to data up to June 30, 2010, Lacierda correctly notes. That’s  right  smack in President Gloria Arroyo’s last year. The Aquino administration is now seeking  to reverse that slide.<br><br>We  agree. But can we budge beyond blame fixing?  <br><br>It’s no walk in the park. We realized that  on  reading  Freedom of the  Press 2010  survey, released in New York  by Freedom House. “Press freedom declined for the eighth consecutive year,“ the study says. “(This) produced  a global landscape in which only one in six people live in countries with a  free press.”<br><br>Freedom House is an independent watchdog organization.  It monitored, over the last 30 years ups and downs of  global media freedom. <br><br>Once upon a  time, in the now  fuzzy  past, the Philippines  stood as  an  unquestioned haven for  liberty of  expression. Not anymore. <br><br>“The Philippines received a downward trend arrow…and ranking of  partly  free.” Freedom House says this is due to  a “general decline in the rule of law in Mindanao”. <br><br>Specifically, it  cites  the massacre of 57 civilians – 32 of whom were journalists -- on their way to register an election candidate. <br><br>“A good leader takes a little more than his share of the blame, a little less than his share of the credit.”  <br><br>The Ampatuans  of Maguindanao are in the dock for the  Maguindanao massacre. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo shirks any blame for coddling warlords. But she was perfectly willing to accept landslide votes from  them.<br><br>Evaluate this  mindset in the context of the Freedom House report. “Over the past decade, the positive momentum that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall has stalled, and in some cases, has been reversed.   <br><br>“The steps backwards taken by a number of the new democracies like Namibia, the Philippines, Senegal,and South Africa are particularly disturbing… Journalists in many countries cannot do their job without fear of repercussions.”<br><br>The Asia-Pacific region recorded  significant  improvements. Bangladesh and Bhutan were upgraded   from “Not Free”  to “Partly-Free“. Improvements were seen in the Maldives, India, East Timor, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and Mongolia.”<br><br>“Declines were noted in Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, the Philippines, and Fiji. This region also continues to be the home of two of the survey’s poorest performers, North Korea and Burma, plus  the world’s largest poor performer, China.”<br><br>On the other end are  the world’s 10 worst-rated countries.  These  are Belarus, Burma, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. <br><br>“In these states, the press acts as a mouthpiece for the regime. Citizens’ access to unbiased information is severely limited. Dissent is crushed…” <br><br> “Unique pressures  are placed on media in countries in the midst of political conflict, as well as intensified constraints on internet freedom.   Globalization of censorship by countries such as China, and international bodies such as the Organization of the Islamic Conference,  poses an additional threat to freedom of expression.”<br><br>We  must  reverse  the erosion of press freedom that  calls for more than just  rhetorical  blame pinning. It calls for  ensuring swift impartial  justice, not just for Maguindanao  victims but those  78  journalists murdered elsewhere.<br><br>What  festers here is  “an established culture of impunity and a flawed political system that relies on warlords”, as  the  International Federation of Journalists says.  “That history of power struggles and political patronage  continues to  threaten the media environment.”<br><br>Systematic violence against the media stems  from tolerance of the Arroyo regime of  a   culture of retribution toward journalists who report on corruption and political issues, IFJ adds. Corrective measures should include witness protection to enhance  journalism ethical standards<br><br>Exacting  accountability ensures  “we accept our own responsibility for the future”. Even former Presidents  must  be called  account,  despite embedded defenders in Congress, Ombudsman, or even the Supreme  Court.  That is  the best guarantee of freedom.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>Who should bear the burden  of nation-building?  The answer of Marine Capt. Nicanor Faeldon is: “Each one should bear the burden of nation-building; we cannot leave to the government and its officials, it is the  duty of each citizen to make sure that he/she had done his/her share.”<br><br>We are quick to engage in the blame game when we see that government is not performing its duties and responsibilities as provided in the Constitution. <br><br>The three branches of government: legislative, executive and judiciary are the three wheels that make our government run. Each branch has its own powers, blending, overlapping and yet, by itself, has an embedded check and balance system.  <br><br>These days, the three branches of government are struggling to function -- trying to keep themselves on the straight path: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dito tayo sa daang matuwid!  </span><br><br>This is the time of reckoning, because according to Sen. Antonio Trillanes, we are at the edge of the aftermath of the “most corrupt government” in recent history. <br><br>The indicators are now hugging the headlines, and it is the press who has the burden of informing the people so they will know the facts, and can decide and form their own opinions. <br><br>Consider the case of the former comptroller, Gen. Carlos Garcia who had amassed a reported staggering at least P300 million in ill-gotten wealth, discovered and documented by the Commission on Audit. <br><br>The paper trail includes vouchers and checks including one for P50 million from the United Nations as reimbursement for the expenses of the peace-keeping forces sent by the Philippines. <br><br>This UN check was signed and cashed by General Garcia, and never endorsed to the Treasurer of the Republic of the Philippines. <br><br>In fact, the U.S. Customs Service arrested the wife and sons of General Garcia upon their entry to the United States, as they were found in possession of $100,000 in cash which they did not declare. This is  the reason why  a clear case of plunder was filed.<br><br>Recently, Gen. Carlos Garcia entered into plea bargaining, and was able to post bail. Again, we say that each one of us, had the duty to make sure that each citizen, especially those who are in government positions, perform his duties faithfully and with fidelity. <br><br>Why was there a plea bargain after the prosecution presented its evidence? This is unusual and irregular in itself. Special Prosecutor Wendell Sulit declared in behalf of the prosecution that they were unfairly being labelled as villains, which is the least hurtful word to describe such an ignominy. <br><br>Please do not insult the intelligence of the Filipino people; people do see through the smokescreen from which they hurl their media blitz to cover up such very, very scandalous and  shameless line of logic. <br><br>The Special prosecutors in this case failed to do their duty faithfully and with fidelity to the Filipino people. <br><br>SWS currently released a Hunger Survey showing the increase by at least 30 percent of the people who eat  one meal or less in a day. <br><br>The P300 million stolen by General Garcia came from the blood, sweat, and tears of the Filipino people, who can hardly meet their daily requirement for food. <br><br>How can the Special Prosecutors justify their actions? They say the government could not do anything but make a deal?<br><br>This is just a slice of how corruption has eroded the conscience of the people who are tasked to keep government officials in line. It is the Special prosecutors of the Office of Ombudsman the  who should go after these plunderers, who have added misery, upon misery to the common people. <br><br>How can they look at themselves in the mirror when they had snatched  food from the clutches of those who pick food from the garbage of  Smokey Mountain? <br><br>Why did this happen? It is because greed has taken over the conscience of men and women who, as Special  Prosecutors, had the duty to recover the money for the Filipino people and punish the perpetrators. <br><br>This is the reason why the wrath of the people is directed at all those people who had no regard for their duties defined under the Constitution,  and in so doing, diminish the  forces of nation-building.<br><br>We support Solicitor Gen. Jose Cadiz  in his difficult task of “undoing  the malefarous deal”, and proving that the executive and  judicial branches of government are doing their job. <br><br>The judiciary is the last bastion of democracy.  When it falls into disrepute, the whole system falls like a deck of cards. The people will have no means to redress of grievances in an orderly and peaceful manner. We have to see the big picture, beyond our own selfish motives.<br><br>Men and women in the judiciary, especially in the Sandiganbayan, have proven  a mastery of the law, and are challenged to be  faithful  in their duty to dispense justice.  This is the reason why the men and women in robes have the heroic tasks of keeping the check and balance  in this fragile democracy of ours. <br><br>This is the time to forestall the descent into darkness, by making plunderers and grafters in government know that Crime does not pay!<br><br>Like what Ninoy said during the dark hours of the  Marcos years: Pity a nation in need of heroes!” <br><br>The call of the hour is for each Filipino to be a true citizen, in thought, in word, and in deed, whether in the public or private sector. <br><br>In this day and age, each act showing commitment to the straight and narrow path is an act of self sacrifice because it is easier to follow the tide going for the money, and whatever benefits they get from every transaction, never  mind the consequences to the nation. <br><br>The task of nation building calls for every citizen to be true to his calling. And  in a sense, to be a hero!<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The standard of review for questions of law is different from that for questions of fact. <br><br>Where the question is one of law, appellate courts perform an independent review because they are as qualified, indeed more so, to review the law as the trial courts. <br><br>Accordingly, the standard of review for questions of law is review <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de novo</span>. But for questions of fact, the appellate court is not as well equipped as the trier of fact. <br><br>The appellate court does not have the opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses as they testify. The appellate justice is not there to see a witness fidget his fingers, or bow his head, or roll his eyes, or nervously sit on his chair, as he testifies. He is not there to hear the witness’s tone of voice. He is not there, in other words, to observe witness behavior that may reveal truth from lies. <br><br>For this reason, appellate courts always view the findings of fact of the trial court with deference. The standard of review that expresses this deference is the substantial evidence standard of review. What does this mean?<br><br>This means that because on appeal, they are confronted with a paper record that is cold and expressionless, appellate courts do not reweigh the evidence. They accept as true the findings of fact of the trial court, and disregard contradicting evidence that the trier of fact had rejected as unworthy of belief. <br><br>Indeed, if appellate courts can reweigh the evidence, what is the need for trial courts?<br><br>In Webb, what standard of review did the Supreme Court use? None really. In reweighing the evidence, the Supreme Court made repeated references to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <br><br>But proof beyond a reasonable doubt is not a standard of review. It is a burden of persuasion that  the prosecution must meet at the trial level. <br><br>By convicting Webb, et al, the trial court determined that the prosecution had overcome this burden. That determination cannot be disturbed on appeal, if supported by substantial evidence. <br><br>The task of the appellate court, therefore, is not to determine whether the guilt of the accused has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there is in the record substantial evidence to support the finding of the trier of fact that the guilt of the accused had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <br><br>If there is in the record substantial evidence to support the finding of the trier of fact, the appellate court must affirm that finding even if it might have found to the contrary had it been the trier of fact.<br><br>How does the appellate court determine the presence of substantial evidence? In <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Jackson v. Virginia</span> (1979), 443 U.S. 307, 318-319, the United States Supreme Court stated that “the critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction must be . . . to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. But this inquiry does not require a court to ‘ask itself whether it believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.’ [Citation]. Instead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.] This familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts. Once a defendant has been found guilty of the crime charged, the factfinder’s role as weigher of the evidence is preserved through a legal conclusion that, upon judicial review, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">all of the evidence</span> is to be considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution.”<br><br>The key here is reviewing the evidence “in the light most favorable to the prosecution.” The “light most favorable to the prosecution” in the Webb case is to find the testimony of witness Alfaro credible and the alibi of Webb incredible, as the trier of fact so found. <br><br>California courts express the substantial evidence standard in even terser language: “The rule is established that when a finding of fact is attacked on the ground that there is not any substantial evidence to sustain it, the power of an appellate court begins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the finding of fact.” (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Key v. McCabe</span>, 54 Cal.2d 736.) <br><br>Under the California standard, the fact that Alfaro’s testimony was contradicted by Webb’s alibi is immaterial, because all it means is that the trial court believed Alfaro’s testimony and disbelieved Webb’s alibi, and the appellate court is powerless to disturb that factual determination. <br><br>Had the Supreme Court applied the deferential substantial evidence standard of review in Webb, as it should have done, it would have had no choice but to affirm the conviction.<br><br>But no standard of review was applied. And that is most unfortunate for Philippine jurisprudence.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Atty. Marcelino C.

As Ecclesiastes says, there is a time to be born and a time to die.  A time for merry-making and a time to mourn.  A time to build and a time to remain still.<br><br>The people of Negros Oriental gave the late Gov. Agustin “Tuting” Perdices his rite of passage last Tuesday. Judging from photographs posted on Facebook by Alex Pal and Judy Flores-Partlow, the funeral procession was well attended from all walks of life.  <br><br>A cursory glance at the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">D Metropost’s Vox Populi</span>  reveals how people close to him and his family are missing Tuting badly. Hurting so bad or just hugely awed by Tuting’s exemplary life as a public servant.  Alex captioned his posts with “burial of a great public servant...worthy of emulation”.<br><br>To paint Tuting with words, here he is in the eyes of his peers and admirers.  Man of ‘honesty and integrity...untainted with graft and corruption.”-- Archbishop Angel Lagdameo.  “Total devotion to serve the common tao.”-- PNP Sr. Supt. Rey Lyndon Lawas.  “A dedicated public servant.” -- Roy T. Cang. “Transparent governance.”-- Atty. Gloria Futalan.  An epitome of the dictum “a public office is a public trust.”--Woodrow Maquiling.  “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kurakot</span> was never in his agenda...an endangered specie in Philippine politics.”-- Dr. Rico Absin.  Going around serving the public “...without bodyguards.”-- Atty. Manuel R. Arbon and Rene Genove.  “A rare breed of a man.”--Baby T. Armogenia.  “A superior public servant.”--Fr. Gamaliel Tulabing.  “His commitment to serve. despite personal odds.”--SU President Ben Malayang III.  “His generous support for the University’s CSR  in undertaking community projects such as the Dumaguete Adventure Marathon, Banica Atong Suba, and the Manjuyod Experiment.-- FU President Mira D. Sinco.  “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kasaligan</span> in public service.”--Newly-installed Gov. Roel Degamo.<br><br>Everything turns around in spite of the emotional hangover.  There is a season to lose and a season to gain.  Time to let go, and time to embrace the change.  Behold, the old is new at the Provincial Capitol.  There is a changeover in the stewardship of the provincial ship of state from Tuting to Gov. Roel Degamo.  <br><br>Contemplating on it, there is a generational change from the late Gov. Agustin “Tuting” Perdices to Gov. Roel Degamo. Tuting was 76 when he passed away. Roel is 44 as he assumes the mantle of provincial leadership.  <br><br>Born in 1935, Perdices belonged to “The Builders” generation.  Born in 1967, Degamo belongs to Generation X.  Another generation, The Baby Boomers (mid-1940’s > mid-1960’s) separate them.<br><br>This is the game-changing situation that the provincial government is breaking into. The old leadership is receding, while the new is emerging into full view.   <br><br>The change will spell the difference between crisis and opportunity.   It will be in a crisis in the provincial leadership if the new fail in filling up the power vacuum left gaping by the passing of the old leadership. <br><br>On the other hand, an opportunity presents itself to the new, daring it to step into a new brave world for her people.<br><br>True to the defining qualities of his generation, Governor Perdices was dutiful, frugal, and had a strong sense of  right and wrong in the exercise of his responsibilities as a public servant.  <br><br>It will do well for the new Governor to build the foundation of his stewardship on these unchanging ethical value of the old.  <br><br>This is very relevant in the light of President Aquino’s mantra for good governance <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“walang mahirap kung walang corrupt.”</span><br><br>Mooring his governance on the old values will temper his tendency to change for sake of change -- which is one of the defining qualities of Gen X.   <br><br>Gen X’ers experience frequent changes in fashionand technology in their lifetimes, and have learned to embrace that the only constant is change.  They are familiar with computers and mobile phones evolving from luxury items into affordable necessities.   They are knowledgeable with their potential to various field of human activities and governance.<br><br>Time was when the provincial leadership was accessible only to a few political heavyweights.  Time was when the people embraced them somehow to govern the Province right into their ripe age, rarely wondering where all the young leaders have gone.  <br><br>Time was and is when the local governments was always hopelessly-dependent on the national government in delivering the basic services to the people.  <br><br>Now, a new age is dawning.  A political non-entity belonging to Gen X is at the helm of the provincial leadership by a quirk of fate in legal succession.<br><br>Being an Xer, it is hoped that Governor Degamo will bring outside-the-box thinking into the provincial leadership.  Gen X is creative.  Gen X is innovative.  <br><br>Let Roel bring them on in laying down his vision, programs, and projects for the rest of his three-year term.  Let the Governor use digital technology to get Negros Oriental future-ready.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Everybody knew the best meal in town was in Lab-as, where you could get mouth-watering seafood dishes already renowned in the rest of the Filipino food world. <br><br>There was the chicken <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">inato</span> at Jo’s, the staple grilled poultry dish in town long before there was competition in City Burger (where the burger is largely imaginary—I mean, who goes there for the burger?), and later in the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lechon manok</span> varieties of Golden Roy’s and San Pedro. <br><br>For a more dressy fare, you went to North Pole or Don Atilano or Mei Yan, and later to Le Chalet and Casablanca—and if you had a car, all the way to Santa Monica and South Sea. (We used to frequent this delightful little Thai restaurant in Tanjay—which was quaint enough to patronize largely due to the distance and effort, and the food was truly brilliant, never mind the hangers of dreadful RTW crowding out the make-do tables and chairs. Once it made the move to Dumaguete, however, it carried its barriotic eccentricities with it, and was promptly shunned by the AB aspirational crowd that’s the Dumaguete bourgeoisie. Everything in food, you see, rests on reputation, and Chin Loong has had its ups and downs, and CocoAmigos has been in steady decline for the past few years.) <br><br>For good food with a beer garden ambience, you went to Rosante’s. For a quick burger, you went to Taster’s Delight.<br><br>But things have changed. The City has changed. Some of those restaurants have shuttered, or have rebranded, or have burned down. <br><br>Today, with a mall south of downtown, the choices have become a little more crowded. Not in the same way that Cebu or Manila or Bacolod does it, but nevertheless, it’s a stirring of sorts, perhaps a sign of better things to come. <br><br>There’re already Gabby’s Bistro and Jutz’s Café (formerly Boston Café) and Neva’s and Likha and Mamia’s and Royal Suite in the mix. <br><br>A fire had razed Rosante’s but this was soon resurrected into the posher Don Roberto’s. Sans Rival expanded from a small pastry shop to become a full-fledged restaurant, open even on Sundays. <br><br>Mang Inasal, meanwhile, has stolen Jo’s thunder—a perplexing development, considering the blandness of its fare. We still go to City Burger sometimes to have our fix of its sugary sauce on our chicken—but the staff is rude and lazy and the orders take a hundred years to come. It is as if they do not want you to plunk down your money for a taste of their food, and so most of the time I don’t go—until I have a full reserve of masochism, enough to withstand the poker faces they sport as you complain and complain and complain. <br><br>In the mall—and hopefully it will be the only mall Dumaguete will ever have—the more popular fare is in Mooon Café, a place I have a love-hate relationship with. It’s a sometimes delightful place, perhaps the best in that egg-shaped promenade that houses Robinson’s small cluster of eating places. The food is passably good, nothing to proclaim heaven with, but it is the service that often irks me. <br><br>Once I experimented with their sense of service. Ten minutes. That was how long it took for any of the wait staff to take note that I was in a table, waiting for at least the menu. I timed it. Good thing that the Mooon steak, with its good gravy and sizzling smokiness, is an eternal favorite. Then there’s the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">chimichanga</span>, the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">quesadilla uno</span>, the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">nacho de salsa</span>, the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">campesinos jalapeno</span>—they pass. The meat of their Mexican baby backribs doesn’t exactly fall off the bone, but it, too, passes. Still, I like the place. It has become a familiar haunt.<br><br>Let’s go downtown. Before it became known as a weekend hangout where dancing and much beer-drinking happens, Sandpipper Café started off as a fine dining place that offered a wide range of dishes cutting across cultures. I was there right in the beginning, already terribly worried about the possible misspelling of its name. Is the extra P necessary? In the menu, there seemed to be the same problem. You see, they offered a “clam chowber” dish. I pointed that out, and asked the waitress: “Don’t you mean clam chowder? With a D?” She shook her head, and said, “No sir, it’s clam chowber.” <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Uh-oh</span>. I ordered it anyway. It wasn’t good. Nor was the babyback ribs that I ordered with it. It was quite a chunk of meat—which I initially thought was a blessing—but soon realized it was as bland as mulched paper. I never thought trying to finish an entire rack of babyback ribs could be an ordeal of tragic proportions, but after a while, I had to tell myself, “Eating more of this wouldn’t make it any good.” And discard it I did. I went home with such sadness.<br><br>But the foll0wing are places I like, and I shall perhaps write about them extensively in the coming days. <br><br>There’s Sundown, near the intersection that leads to Robinson’s Place—a beautifully-landscaped beer garden, complete with the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">alfresco</span> feel, that transcends whatever image it wants to project to offer some of the most surprising cooking in town. Surprising because you don’t expect so much from such a small place. Still, it has the imprimatur of Santa Monica’s kitchen, which says a lot about the seriousness of its food.<br><br>There’s Flaming Grill in Tubod, along Hibbard Avenue. This is where you get what is possibly the best burger in town. If you’re a Dumagueteño and you swear by your memories of Taster’s Delight, your loyalty is actually rooted in that strange alchemy its peculiar Russian dressing makes in the burger. <br><br>Flaming Grill is different: the sumptuousness is in the patty itself—a smoky, rich, almost creamy munchiness that will leave you craving for more. It is that good.<br><br>Then there’s Mifune along Sta. Catalina St., just across Food Net. This is where you get the best Japanese food in town bar none. Do not let its <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">karinderia</span> looks fool you—I consider that part of its understated charm. It has everything, from your regular sashimi and sushi to their sumptuously prepared <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">okonomiyaki</span>. The taste is just right—and the staff contains some of the friendliest I know in town. And they know their menu well, which is a feat.<br><br>And finally, there’s KRI along Silliman Avenue, across the Hibbard Hall. I have been going to this place almost every day for the past few weeks, judiciously going through its menu in search of another gustatory delight. So far it has not disappointed. Their <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pad thai</span> has been consistently great, their spicy shrimp and tofu has solid fans among friends I know—but I swear by their fish of the week dish. It has a delicious simplicity to it that tantalizes the palate, and all for less than 99 pesos. A bargain, really. Exactly what discriminating Dumagueteños look for—something cheap, but approximating the fineness of fine dining.<br><br>Consider this an appetizer of sorts. Perhaps full praise requires another story.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>Lately, I’ve been disturbed to find that many of the students I have met, at all levels, tend to treat school as a dull chore that must be endured on the one hand, and on the other hand, a forum for socializing.  <BR><BR>I’m disappointed when I hear students complaining about how difficult their tests are, or claiming they did not learn anything from their class because their teacher was a “low talker” or their teacher was bad.  <BR><BR>Certainly, teachers vary in their ability and effectiveness, but none of them will be able to teach a student who does not take the idea of schooling seriously.  <BR><BR>Teaching and learning is a give and take: it takes a good teacher to create an interest and inspire students to learn. But it also takes a good student, who shows an interest in learning, in order for teachers to be motivated to teach effectively.<BR><BR>The qualities that allow students to excel are not endowed by nature, but are the result of the influence of their first teachers, i.e. their parents.  By their example, parents’ involvement with the learning process during our formative years stimulates our interest and curiosity in learning new things.  <BR><BR>Yes, I know what it’s like to be a student -- been there, done that.  I can also say that I had my moments of weakness and lassitude during those years.  <BR><BR>For example, I used to rejoice whenever classes were cancelled.  But over all, it was my good fortune to have parents that took education seriously, and were able to impart some of that attitude to me.<BR><BR>Yes, part of the reason that students don’t find school fun or interesting is that classes are not interactive or challenging enough.  <BR><BR>Good teaching is not about imparting information; it’s about teaching students how to think for themselves, and indeed to teach themselves.  <BR><BR>You know the old saying, “give a man a fish and feed him for a day, but teach a man to fish, and he can feed himself for a lifetime.”  <BR><BR>During our elementary years, we must acquire basic skills: the alphabet, reading and writing, basic mathematics, general science, etc.  <BR><BR>When we reach high school, we should be able to apply these basic skills to more sophisticated problems, i.e. algebra, geometry, trigonometry, physics.  <BR><BR>English grammar and essay writing must be perfected at this stage as well, and hopefully the excitement and joy of great literature, carefully selected, of course, can be inculcated.  <BR><BR>With this kind of preparation, college can be a chance to become a full-fledged adult, applying the basic tools and knowledge mastered in high school to subjects of our choosing.<BR><BR>Learning is both a means to survival and an end in itself.  To learn the art of thinking is why we are in school, not only to solve simple problems or gain specific information, but also to learn to use the tools of logic, comprehension, and critical reasoning, which are not only required in our professional lives, but also for our survival as fully human subjects in this complex world.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

But of course the company keeps a piece of this money before they pass it on.  Wire service is not a charity.<br><br>Wire services are big business in Dumaguete.

At a conservative salary estimate of P15,000 per employee, BPOs will pump in P31.7 million each month.<BR><BR>No doubt, this money will benefit many businesses in Dumaguete and the neighboring towns and cities. Sales of motorcycles will continue to increase, more salesmen will be needed. There will be more customers in restaurants, hopefully giving rise to a demand for more cooks, waiters, and waitresses. More homes will be built, giving more jobs for carpenters, and sales for hardware stores. Department stores will surely sell more stuff, and tricycles will have more passengers. This money could also support many students through school.<BR><BR>More people might be tempted to move to Dumaguete. This would create more pressure on our meager resources. There will be increased garbage to collect, bigger traffic to control, streets to clean more often, street lights to install, roads to be paved, etc.<BR><BR>The sad reality, however, is that none of these supposedly improved economic scenarios find their way to the coffers of the City in taxes. Mayor Manuel Sagarbarria says he is having a hard time trying to apportion the taxes the City receives for all the services that are needed to keep Dumaguete running.<BR><BR>Under the current setup, most business are free to declare any income to the City.

Just look at the world map, and realize our position as a small country (relative to large masses of continents) that is cut up into small pieces of islands surrounded by marine waters. <BR><BR>Our country can easily run out of potable freshwater to sustain our ever-growing population, that some scientists have predicted that water crisis could hit us in the future because of climate changes beyond our ability to control. <BR><BR>Our people and our government officials should seriously consider this threat and make every effort to prevent it from happening by taking proactive action now, not tomorrow. <BR><BR>Our waters, marine and fresh, are so important to our health and well being that we cannot afford to neglect safeguarding our seas and our freshwater water supplies. <BR><BR>We should learn lessons from developed nations. In the United States such as the state of New Jersey, environmental laws regarding the quality of ground water are strongly enforced. <BR><BR>Testing the presence of oil in water is serious business. I personally know this because my own son is involved in the testing of ground water for the presence of oil and petroleum products that leak from oil depots.

One can build oil depots/oil pipelines in practically any part of the land, including sites in the vicinity of natural springs. <BR><BR>Oil depots are a potential source of oil leaks into ground water. Local government units in general are insensitive to, or unaware of possible consequences of oil/gasoline spills resulting from natural events such as earthquakes, and even just the vibrations of the soil caused by the passage of large, heavy vehicles on roads near gasoline pipelines and depots. <BR><BR>In this connection, take note of the recent gasoline spill in Makati that has displaced a large number of people residing in a large building. <BR><BR>Who knows how much oil is found in groundwater in the Makati area affected by the gasoline spill?

Today, the HDI yardstick tracks  human development across countries. This  measure underpins  UNDP’s  annual  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Human Development Report</span>.<br><br>HDIs  go beyond  the  old one-dimensional  gross national product. GNPs  divide  national wealth  by population. This  crude  yardstick  was useful. But it also  smudged  stark disparities. GNP  bracketed Imelda Marcos with the diamond tiara with the beggar in rubber flip-flops. <br><br>The GNP doesn’t  capture human options or freedoms either. So, “learn conventional economics but don’t use it much,”  the young Pakistani student  Mahbubul Haq  said.  “Who  wants to  know what sets the price of toothpaste? But it helps answer the right questions.”<br><br> Right questions were on education, health, security, aspirations even, agreed  the equally young Indian  student Amartya  Sen. ”We need a measure that is not as blind to social aspects as GNP is.”<br><br> There was something of  the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Human Development Report</span> already then,  Sen recalled at the New York  1998  memorial rites for Haq.  Sen  won the  Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences that year.  After leaving Yale University, Haq  amplified his “human development theory”  at the World Bank and UN.  <br><br>Sen and  Haq, at UNDP, led   a team of  scientists to produce the maiden  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Human  Development Report</span> in 1990. “People are the real  wealth of a nation,”their lead sentence read.  <br><br>The 20th  anniversary issue of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">HDR</span> reiterates that  theme. <br><br>Annual reports now factor into  HDI  tables  life expectancy, literacy,  and  incomes.  This measurement innovation continues. Three new gauges – extreme deprivation, gender disparities, and  inequalities – are tacked  into  this year’s edition.<br><br>Tables have been buttressed. Aside from standard demographic statistics, one finds, in this new report,  yardsticks on sustainability and vulnerability;  access to information technology;  human security, civic and community well being, even perceptions on individual well-being.<br><br>Each report  continues to  marshal  data on key issues. The HDR in 1998  analyzed  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Globalization with a Human Face</span>. In 2002, the focus was on <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Deepening Democracy in a  Fragmented World</span>. A year later, Millennium Development Goals  were centerpiece  in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A Compact among Nations to End Human Poverty.</span><br><br>  The global water crisis and international migration  came under scrutiny  in 2008  and  2009.<br><br>The in-between years all   span off  more  than 600 national  HDRs. All were researched,  written, and  published in individual countries. <br><br>A  biennial publication, the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Philippine Human Development  Report</span>, first came off the press in 1994.<br><br>Spearheaded by  economists like Solita Monsod and Arsenio Balisacan,  Filipino scientists who have churned out  seven biennial  HDRs since.<br><br> At  a  Rio de Janeiro  conference, Philippine  HDRs  were cited for excellence in design, innovative use of human  development measurement tools, as well as  participation and  policy impact. <br><br>From it’s initial computation of HDIs for each of the Philippine  regions, PHDRs  have covered  festering national concerns.<br><br>The 1997 report on gender documented significant gains by women, in education, jobs, and elections. At century’s turn, the report zeroed in on the sharp  decline in quality of Philippine education and outlined reforms. Work and Well Being and Human Security were themes for 2002 and 2005.  <br><br>The report before 2010’s  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">In Search for a Human Face</span> concentrated on  how institutions and politics impact on human development. ”The Ombudsman’s record in disposition of cases and conviction is far from sterling,” the 2009 study  said. “(It) has been described as an agency where cases ‘just lie there and they die there…It’s credibility dropped to a low  level.”<br><br>PHDR  breaks down lumps of data. Analysis by provinces  revealed, for example, that La Union now has the longest life expectancy at 74.6 years. Life is “nasty, brutish, and short” in  Tawi-Tawi at  53.4 years.  <br><br>They also compare  HDIs between countries and provinces.  Azerbijan on one end, and Paraguay on the other,  for instance,  sandwich Batanes, Laguna, Bataan, Batangas, La Union, and Pampanga.<br><br>Despite modest incomes, some countries made great gains in  health, life expectancy, education, and overall living standrads, writes UNDP Adminstrator  Helen Clark.   <br><br>In sharp contrast, some  countries with strong economic performance lagged.<br><br> Always  wedged into less-than-vigorous performance, the Philippines  slumped from its No.99 slot in overall HDI  index  in 2005 to No. 97 today.  Almost a  quarter of  Filipinos  ( 24% ) lack access to improved sanitation. Many  feel severe deprivation in  schooling (13%), health (14%),  and living standards. We’re better off than Cambodians, but  lagging behind Malaysians.<br><br>“On one crucial point, the evidence is compelling,”  Clark  adds. “Improvements are  never automatic.

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>SWITZERLAND -- The start of the new year has seen still more changes in the Province’s political leadership, although it remains to be seen how truly effective and beneficial this will be for Negros Oriental.  <br><br>For one thing, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">trapo</span> politics has apparently been at work to ensure that certain families retain political power. <br><br>Economist and political analyst Winnie Monsod in a column last month urged citizens themselves to get involved in public life, apart from electing public officials every three years, to offset this hold, and to promote direct democracy.  The start of a new year is a good time to think about that. <br><br>Here I am again for some weeks in the land of direct democracy, good old stable (and a mite dull) Switzerland whose example Monsod cited. The Swiss system famously allows citizens to propose initiatives and referendums on national issues,  to hold public assemblies on local issues as in the quaint tradition of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Landsgemeinde</span> that still survives in a few places where voters gather in an outdoor public place and vote by a show of hands.  <br><br>On the other hand, the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gemeindeversammlung</span> is the assembly of the citizens of a town called at least twice yearly, usually in the town hall, to exercise oversight, and receive reports from the local administration, or to decide on financial matters or other local matters.  (And incidentally, political office in this country is not a function of belonging to a particular family.) <br><br>Winnie Monsod informed or reminded us that the Philippine political system, too, provides an important venue for direct democracy, namely, the barangay assembly.  <br><br>She urged us to get out of our comfortable habits and passive modes, and to attend these assemblies where every resident of the barangay has a right to participate.  <br><br>By law, barangay assemblies have to be held at least twice a year, in April and October, or more frequently as needed. In these assemblies, citizens can propose resolutions, legislation, projects, or funding priorities.  <br><br>We can question decisions of the barangay council or even move to nullify them.  Everyone can speak out.  This is important because while the local government code stipulates the independent and non-partisan functioning of the barangay council, it is a reality that local chief executives and even higher officials seek to control or exert their influence in the barangay.  <br><br>And as in a feudal relationship, barangay officials often accept the dictates of their “betters.”  <br><br>But as Winnie stresses, the barangay captain or chair is accountable to and must report, not primarily to political leaders, but to the people in the barangay assembly.  (Shades of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gemeindeversammlungin</span> this…) She cites local government expert Manny Valdehuesa who warns that our being passive will allow the perpetuation of  “government of politicians, for politicians, and by politicians.” <br>  <br>It is also particularly important to know where and how public money is spent, for  Monsod lists barangays’ sources of income:   20 percent of the total IRA,  25 percent of real estate tax revenues, 50 percent of the community tax collected for the LGU, and 100 percent of collections from open markets, cockpits, documentary stamps and the like, in addition to funds barangays can solicit from the  province, congressmen/women or other sources. <br><br>Thus, it is a good idea and, in fact, a civic duty, to heed Winnie Monsod’s urging to resurrect the barangay assembly by being present and active.  <br><br>In particular, more women should get involved.  It has been noted that in NGOs and so-called people’s organizations (POs) and even in church organizations, it is women who are willing to give time and effort;  the barangay assembly, in our immediate area of residence, is the logical venue to raise and address community issues like health or infrastructure needs, garbage, noise, peace and order, or other problems.   <br><br>Getting involved in the barangay can be a way to begin to change the political culture of political docility and subservience to political leaders, and a means to directly participate in determining the future of our communities.  <br><br>It seems to work for Switzerland;  be there at your next barangay assembly.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Alam mo, pinahirapan ako ng dalawang araw diyan sa Dumaguete!” </span><br><br>This remark came from  a Justice of the Supreme Court. It turned out that he had stayed at Bethel  Guesthouse -- where  no alcoholic drinks or smoking is allowed.  A lover of good wine and smoke, the Justice recounted how he was sweetly directed to seek his pleasures at the neighboring establishments outside the hotel, along the boulevard.<br><br>Mrs. Filomena Cang,  “Apo” to friends and acquaintances, was “bold as lion”when it comes to professing her Christian values in her home, business, and involvements in the community. <br><br>Now she has joined the Creator in His “mansion in the sky”. The resoluteness and steadfastness in her conviction that a hotel can thrive as a business even with the rule of “No Alcoholic Drinks or Smoking Allowed”was met with skepticism and best wishes, because mixing religion and business is some kind of oxymoron. How can you mix money-making with seeking  spiritual treasures in the afterlife?<br><br>This is the reason why Apo was an exemplary Christian, Christ-centered, steeped in the Confucian philosophy of her Chinese ancestry.  <br><br>In celebration of her life, SU Church, led by the Rev. Jonathan Pia,  Rev. Elmer Saa, Rev. Bernadette Amistoso-Morales, and Rev. Jeremias Lagahit held a  memorial service to honor this simple, ordinary steward who was able to achieve extraordinary stature in the realm of the academe. <br><br>Former Finance Sec. Juanita Dy-Amatong was brief and concise when she  recognized her long-time friend, benefactor, co-worker, and  fellow traveller through the highs and lows of  the life and times of Silliman University, the University Church, and the SU Medical Center. <br><br>Dr. Ben Malayang, now on his second term as President, said he grew up looking up to this grand lady who was actively engaged through the development stages of the University,  and expressed the gratitude of a  Silliman family that remembers her with much fondness and awe. <br><br>Atty. Pearl Estacion, as chair of the SU Church Council, comforted the grieving family with her words of remembrance and celebration of  the life of a   dedicated church worker. <br><br>For many faculty members, Apo was a person who listened to them, and lent her assistance in her own low key manner.  <br><br>Conversing with Josefina Pal, she also intimated how the Cangs gave away calendars to schools, and how they offered their assistance to her family during their time of bereavement when Dr. Graciano Pal passed away, lending vehicles, etc. <br><br>The celestial music of the members of the Covenant Choir, the songs of Dr. Samuel Gregorio and Rudy Juan inspired those who attended, as Silliman Church kept its ambiance of solemnity and serenity, but it became glorious with the rendition of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hallelujah Chorus</span>.<br><br>The Malayang sisters, Fe Pia and Dr. Eva Moncada, with Atty. Ray Moncada, joined  to bear witness to a woman whom the community looked up to as an example of Christian living. Judge Crescencio & Dr. Betsy Joy Tan, Judge Fe & Prosecutor Elson Bustamante, the SUHS Class of ‘67, Beckay & Dr. Noriel Capulong, Amelia Bejar, Rev. Dodong & Marina Mendoza,  Roberto Montebon, Atty. Didil & Marietta Montebon -- their presence, along with the many others who had in one way or another been part of Apo’s web of kindness, wisdom, and generosity attested to how many lives she truly touched.  <br><br>When Dr. Ruth Chang responded in behalf of the family, she recognized how her mother was really involved with Silliman University. <br><br>The legacy of Mrs. Cang lives on, in the hearts of those who were touched by her Christian web, actualizing the motto via, veritas, vita.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>Recently, in my class on contemporary issues at the College of Law of Silliman University, we critiqued the Supreme Court decision in People v. Hubert Webb (Vizconde case). A student asked me if any motion for reconsideration following the judgment of acquittal might not constitute double jeopardy from which the accused is constitutionally protected.<br><br>I answered it might, if the motion for reconsideration used language that could be read or interpreted as admitting the validity of the judgment sought to be reconsidered. <br><br>For instance, a motion for reconsideration that simply states that the court was wrong in giving credence to the alibi of Webb while rejecting the testimony of Jessica Alfaro, and should right that wrong by going the other way (that is, give credence to the testimony of Alfaro and reject the alibi of Webb) could be barred by double jeopardy, because that kind of motion for reconsideration impliedly admits the validity of the reweighing process employed by the court to reach the judgment of acquittal, and simply requests the court to use the same reweighing process to reach the opposite conclusion. <br><br>Asking the court to reweigh the same evidence twice would be wrong. Why would the Supreme Court want to do that? The presumption is that the Supreme Court spent a lot of time and scarce court resources in reweighing the record evidence to arrive at the conclusion that Alfaro’s testimony was unworthy of belief and that Webb had presented a strong alibi to establish his innocence. <br><br>Therefore, a motion for reconsideration that simply asks the court to redo the whole reweighing process again so that it could conclude that Alfaro, and not Webb, was the credible witness is a tremendous waste of premium court time and resources. <br><br>More than that, such a process would subject Webb to double jeopardy because if the first reweighing process was valid, then that process could have validly convicted Webb, and so a repeat of that process could subject Webb to a second jeopardy of conviction. The fact that the first reweighing process resulted in acquittal makes no difference; double jeopardy still applies.<br><br>So long, therefore, as any motion for reconsideration can be viewed as impliedly admitting the validity of the reweighing process that was used to reverse the judgment of the trial court and the Court of Appeals, the rule on double jeopardy would preclude a repetition of the process. <br><br>If the reweighing process was a valid process, then the conclusion reached was valid, however strongly one may disagree with the court’s appreciation of the evidence.<br><br>But if, on the other hand, the motion challenges the validity of the reweighing process for being the wrong process, and asks the court to look at the record evidence again using a different (but the correct) process, double jeopardy would not apply. <br><br>There is no double jeopardy because the flawed process that was used to decide the appeal did not result (and could not have resulted) in a valid conclusion. <br><br>Any conclusion reached, for or against any party, through the employment of a flawed process, is null and void as a denial of constitutional due process. <br><br>Reweighing the evidence, which the Supreme Court employed in Webb, is the wrong process to use in reviewing the judgment of a trial court. <br><br>As pointed out in an earlier article published in this paper, the correct process is to review the record under the deferential substantial evidence standard of review. (See <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Jackson v. Virginia</span>, 443 U.S. 307, which supplanted the no evidence standard in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Thompson v. Louisville</span>, 362 U.S. 199.)<br><br>The proper motion to file to strike at the heart (the validity) of the process is not a motion for reconsideration; it is a motion to vacate or set aside the judgment. <br><br>For if the judgment is vacated, or set aside, it is, in law, as if there was no judgment at all. Vacating a judgment puts back the case to where it was prior to the void judgment. <br><br>At that point, the accused was not in double jeopardy of conviction. <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Atty.

She was the seventh child in a family of 11 children. She spent her elementary years in Larena, and attended the UCCP Church in Larena.{{more}}<br><br>After elementary school, she came to Dumaguete to attend Silliman High School. World War II interrupted her studies, so her graduation was delayed until she was 18 years old. She belonged to the proud class of 1948.<br><br>Filomena married to Agapito Cang on Aug. 22, 1948. They have four children:  Roy, Roland, Ruth, and Grace.<br><br>In 1957, Agapito and Filomena rented a small space to set up a one-door store  called  Dumaguete General Supply along what is now Perdices Street. The couple managed store operations together, with their children’s yaya doubling as saleslady. <br><br>After a few expansion measures, Agapito and Filomena set up a wholesale store called Cang’s Trading , just across the street. <br><br>In 1982, the store was transferred a few blocks farther, and the Dumaguete General Supply became Cang’s Inc. Much later, Cang’s opened a branch in one corner of Maria Cristina St.<br><br>In 1996, Bethel Guest House, the first convention hotel in Dumaguete, opened for business.<br><br>In November last year, Cang’s Inc. moved again to its location along the North Highway in Daro and called it Cang’s Shopping Complex. <br><br>By that time, although Filomena Cang was no longer directly involved with store operations, she remained the inspiration to eldest son Roy and all the staff of the Cang’s stores.<br><br>Business, however, was not the most important thing in Mrs. Cang’s life. Her commitment to Christian ministry, and to being a part of Silliman University, were more important. <br><br>She was a trained Evangelism Explosion leader, and coordinated EE training seminars in Dumaguete for many years. She was honored by EE Philippines during their 6th Asian Leadership conference in 2004, where she shared a memorable heart-stirring witness of her faith in Jesus Christ.  She was also happy to have met Dr. D. James Kennedy, founder of Evangelism Explosion. <br><br>Filomena Cang’s main concern was always the salvation of her friends and of anyone she met along the way.  She actively shared about Jesus whenever she could. She was an active member of Dumaguete Christian Church, and served for several terms as deaconess.<br><br>For Mrs. Cang, being a member of the Board of Trustees of Silliman University from 1989 to 1999 was one of the most exciting happenings in her life. She became chairperson of the Human Resources Management Committee, and the Hospital Ad Hoc Committee. She also served on the Board of Directors of the SU Alumni Association.<br><br>The Silliman University Medical Center Foundation is dear to Mrs. Cang’s heart, a passion which started with her being a charter member of the Women’s Auxiliary in the post-War years of the then Mission Hospital. She became more active as SUMC as member of the Hospital Board from 1983 to 1986, and as SUMC Executive Committee chairperson from 1985 to 1986. <br><br>Mrs. Cang traveled to meet with Silliman alumni in faraway places mainly to campaign for hospital funds.  She went to SU alumni groups in Southern California, Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, and New York. Her simple and heartfelt appeal for donations always struck a generous response from the alumni.<br><br>Not content with this, Mrs. Cang bravely knocked on the doors of the United Board for Christian Higher Education, and requested for hospital funds. <br><br>For her efforts, a grateful SU Medical Center Foundation  conferred on Mrs. Cang the SUMC Women’s Auxiliary Service Award in 1985, and in 2005, the SUMC Foundation’s Golden Award for Service.<br><br>In recognition of her service to the community and to Silliman, Mrs. Cang received several special awards. She was an Outstanding Negrense awardee in 2005, and Outstanding Sillimanian Awardee in 2006.<br><br>In 2005, her husband of almost 57 years, Agapito Cang, went home to be with the Lord. After his passing, and even with her own health deteriorating, Mrs. Cang continued to serve the Lord by attending and leading small groups, hosting servants of the Lord, and sharing Jesus with others. <br><br>She had a very active literature ministry, providing reading materials for people going through different struggles. <br><br>Last year, when she was more certain she was finally going home to the Lord,  Mrs. Cang received so much blessing and joy spending time with her caregivers and household help. They did morning devotions and sang and danced everyday. The daily meeting with the Lord was a source of strength for her.<br><br>On Jan. 15, 2011, Mrs. Filomena Cang peacefully went home to be with the Lord. She was surrounded by her children Roy, Ruth, and Grace, some family members, and close friends.<br><br>Indeed, Mrs. Filomena Cang was a blessing to many.

Their life has been a wonderful story in itself, which is written about in books they have published, and in their website <a href=\"www.sparkyourdream.net\">www.sparkyourdream.net</a>. They left Dumaguete Saturday on their trip to Iloilo City.  (Photo from the Zapp website)<br><br>Herman Zapp, 42 was born in San Francisco, California and was raised in Argentina.  His wife Candelaria Zapp, 40, was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They have four children, each born in a country different from the other: Pampa, eight, was born in  the USA; Tehue, five, was born in Argentina; Paloma, three, was born in Canada; while Wallaby, one year old, was born in Australia.<br><br>According to their website, Herman and Candy both grew up in the country, amongst ponies and cousins. At eight and10  years of age, they met, and the impossible love that they felt at that time grew and became a reality when she was only 14. For another 10 years, they dated and grew up together with a dream accompanying them. But after six years of marriage, they took their first steps pushed by their desire to have children. They said, “First let’s complete our dream, then we’ll have children.” There couldn’t have been a better way: their first son arrived together with the dream, one dream inside another.  <br><br> During the trip from Argentina to Alaska, they printed their first book, Atrapa Sueños which was the bestselling book at the International Book Fair in Costa Rica. This was enlarged, translated into English as Dream Chaser and printed seven more times. By the time they got to Alaska, they had  sold out 12 thousand copies, simply by sales from people meeting them while in their vintage car during the trip.    <br><br>The trip was a Big Dream, but when it was over, their dream kept growing.  They returned to Argentina and wrote the book Atrapa tu Sueño which became a best-seller in Argentina in 2005. Today its 8th edition is in print. They translated and edited it into English, and Spark Your Dream was published in 2007. Today its 3rd edition is in print. They are still writing … and more books are certainly on the way in the near future.    <br><br> The Zapps travelled all around Argentina, where their second boy was born. Since then, they have not stopped. Their car was shipped to Florida and so began a new journey driving along a fresh route. They headed north to Montreal, then west to Vancouver Island, where their princess Paloma was born, and finally, they went south to Los Angeles, California.  <br><br>They then went to Australia. As soon as they got there, their fourth baby arrived and, with him aboard, they covered a complete loop around the country. They’ve been in deserts where only kangaroos live, and where fuel is not available for a stretch of at least 500 kilometres. Then the car was shipped to New Zealand, where they travelled through both the North and South Islands. Having completed their piece of Oceania, they headed for Asia, their next continent.  <br><br>Currently, they are in the Philippines. They are poised to drive through 18 more countries within Asia. The Zapps have been on the road for the last 10 years.  Some may say they may not have the ideal car to circle the world, and some may say they don’t have the required funds needed, but when you read the book and the many extraordinary experiences they have had, you will likely come to believe they have the perfect car, all the resources they need, and  have something more important than anything else -- the willingness to chase and accomplish their dream.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>The business process outsourcing (BPO) industry here is urging new graduates who are potential BPO workers to work in the local companies instead of leaving to seek employment in BPOs in Cebu and Manila.<BR><BR>The lure of working in big cities have been drawing graduates away from the university town, causing concern among local BPO companies who noted a drop in the number of local applicants.<BR><BR>The BPO companies here have banded together to conduct a roadshow to inform students about the perks of working for local companies. “We want to let them know that although the salary rates in Manila and Cebu might look attractive, in the end, working here is still the better alternative,” said Suzanne Lu-Bascara, manager of Spi Global based in Bacong town. <BR><BR>Bascara disclosed that a group of human resource representatives from the BPO companies here met to compute the expenses of a BPO entry level worker in Dumaguete versus those in Manila based on the actual basic salary rates.  It was learned that an entry level worker would spend only 30% here of what she would have spent for rent in Manila, 40% to 50% for food if she eats outside her home and 50% for transportation costs. <BR><BR>An entry level BPO worker in Manila only get to save 20% to 25% of her salary and this excludes recreation expenses. “When you’re in Manila, with all the clubs and things to buy, your 25% becomes negative and you will max out your credit card,” said Bascara.<BR><BR>She said that most of the employees who left their jobs here to work in Manila come back with “horror” stories of what happened to them-- “they had been robbed, they were living in squalid conditions and they realized that coming home is the better alternative.”<BR><BR>The acceptance rate of local applicants in BPO companies here has also declined in the last few years. Dana Fortunato of Student Universe described the acceptance rate in the province as “very low”, from 50% acceptance rate out of a hundred applicants some 2 years ago to what is now lower than 10%. <BR><BR>On the other hand, the industry’s attrition rate – workers leaving or getting fired – has been on the rise. From a 2% attrition rate four years ago, it is now fast approaching 10%, said Fortunato during the forum held by the Philippine Information Agency here. <BR><BR>The BPO industry here launched their campaign to attract more applicants as the industry will need 2,115 fulltime employees for 2011. <BR><BR>Fortunato said there is a need for the industry to work with the schools and the local government units (LGUs) in the province to fill the industry’s employment needs by the end of this year. “We want to get the workers locally without having to look outside the province,” she said. <BR><BR>The group is scheduled to meet with department heads and councilors from LGUs to discuss their concerns followed by BPO site tours. They also plan to meet with schools officials to address what the companies observed as a dip in the quality of applicants in terms of English communication and computer literacy skills. <BR><BR>“There are young kids who say they are computer literate yet they don’t even know how to save a document. They know how to Facebook and play online games but don’t know how to work with Excel,” said Fortunato. <BR><BR>Bascara added that some positions in SPi Global, a knowledge process outsourcing and  customer interaction service provider, require fast typing skills. “We found out that the schools have phased out typing 101 and people are now using 2 or 3 fingers when they type on the computer,” she noted.<BR><BR>BPOs in the country is part of the information communications technology industry (ICT) dubbed as the “Sunshine Industry” due to its vast contribution to the Philippine economy and employment. <BR><BR>In 2006, the BPO industry alone contributed around USD$3.2 billion to the country’s economy. It jumped to around USD$9 billion last year. <BR><BR>The Philippines is eyeing to get a share of the projected USD$256 billion for offshoring and offsourcing in the global BPO market by 2016. <BR><BR>In a recent study commissioned by IBM, the country has overtaken India to grab the No. 1 spot in terms of voice BPO globally.

This privilege is in accordance with the Republic Act No. 7432 and DILG Circular 94036.<BR><BR>Under City Ordinance 15, series of 2009, the basic fare rate is adjusted in proportion to the pump price of premium gasoline per liter.<BR><BR>The fare was pegged at P6.50 when the price of fuel was at P42.50 per liter but with premium gasoline at P62.50 per liter, the fare would be pegged at P8.00 per person. When premium gasoline price would reach P107.50, the basic fare rate would automatically adjust to P12.50 per person.<BR><BR>But Vice Mayor Alan Gel Cordova said that a resolution to this effect has not yet been made and the ordinance still needs to be passed in the Council and signed by Mayor Manuel Sagarbarria before it could fully be implemented.<BR><BR>Cordova said in the absence of a tariff posted on the tricycle, the driver does not have the right to demand the increase.<BR><BR>On the other hand, during the public hearing, Sayson said most of the complaints raised by the public were the refusal of MCH drivers to convey passengers especially if their destination is quite far and some includes smoking while driving, over speeding, and snubbing passengers.<BR><BR>Sayson said any driver who violates traffic rules and regulations will get a citation ticket from traffic enforcers, varying from P100 to P 1,500 depending on the weight of the offense.<BR><BR>Sayson called on the public to cooperate with the law enforcement agency in disciplining MCH drivers by reporting all their violations and infractions to the Traffic Management Office (TMO).<BR><BR>The city official plans to post hotline numbers in every tricycle so that it would be easier to contact the TMO whenever there are complaints.

Years later, he joined forces with Enrique Sobrepeña, a Pastor’s kid, to found the College Insurance Plan, and became its first vice president up to his retirement.<br><br>During the book launching, guest speaker and SU President Dr. Ben S.

We were really amazed at the ancient house where our national hero lived during his exile. We saw the letters and poems written by Rizal, his own version of the Code of Ethics, his shell collection which were beautifully preserved by the local government, the black board and table used by Rizal during his stint as teacher to 24 students, and a water system Rizal himself assembled.<br><br>Indeed, visiting the shrine was like walking with Jose Rizal a century ago.<br><br>After taking a glimpse of the past, we went to the newly- inaugurated Gloria’s FantasyLand. Completed in 2009, this P200 million structure within the Gloria de Dapitan commercial complex is owned by  Zamboanga del Norte Cong. Romeo Jalosjos. It is the biggest theme park outside Metro Manila with 35 various rides.<br><br>Indeed, it was reminiscing time on childhood memories for the Magsaysay teachers as they took  turns riding the 18-seater Old Western Train powered by a diesel locomotive that pulls the it through  a  mini forest; the Midi Flume Ride, which creates a river wild atmosphere; the Mini Coaster Ride which is like a roller skate ride, etc.<br><br>And what could be the most fitting finale to the trip? Spending the rest of the day at Dakak Beach Park & Resort, where we enjoyed jet skiing, kayaking, sailing, snorkeling.<br><br>Dakak prides in having  designed its park and resort adapting to its natural surroundings. The distinctive native style cottages are constructed in traditional bamboo and nipa leaves, and feature marble-tiled bathrooms and capiz shell window panes. The beach is adorned with wild orchards of papaya, mango, coconut, banana, and frangipani; the entire village simply following the natural contours of the vast 15 hectare resort.<br><br>Indeed, the trip of the Magsaysay teachers was fun and educational. It did not only help relieve stress, it also opened the eyes of the educators to the rich history of our forefathers. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">(Contributed article/Victoria Maquiling)</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\"><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Shakespeare says, “a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.”  Precisely, it matters if it’s the real name.  It means a lot to have Rose as the name if you want the scent of a rose.  That’s living up to the name, not complicated by any means, just due sweetness to the name.</span><br><br>Negros Oriental has a new governor, in a political sense, a boy-governor.  Roel is his name.  Roel is a Dutch boy name.  It means “famous land.”   Roel is short for Roeland -- in English, Roland, Rowland in Germany, and Orlando in Italy.  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Song of Roland</span>  is an icon in literature. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Song of Roland</span> is the centerpiece of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Matter of France</span>, the legendary history of King Charlemagne and his Knights’ seven-year war against the Saracens in Spain.  As the King’s right hand man, Roland fought with a sense of duty for his lord and ultimately for the Lord God. His bond with his King and with his men is love.  A kind of love that he died for.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Roel is a real deal.  The name has rich traditions in a number of European countries.  As a matter for France is the Song of Roland; as a matter for Negros Oriental, the Song of Roel -- the stirring of something big figuratively and literally speaking. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">For all we know, with Roel at the helm of the provincial leadership, Negros Oriental may yet become a “famous land” to step out from the shadow of Negros Occidental.  He is no ideal leader.  But there is no denying, Roel is the new deal.  He is for real.</span><br><br>As always, there is a yawning gap between dream and reality, intent and consequence.  <br><br>A concerned citizen Lino Enojo rued that Roel is not yet equipped with strong leadership qualities.   South Sea Resort Hotel Proprietor Baby T. Armogenia advised the new Governor to seek counsel from successful and highly respected members of the community. Two home-grown businessmen Tyrone Ramas Uypitching and Edward Du urged the boy Governor to just continue the programs of Governor Macias and Governor Perdices; while another homegrown businessman Roy T. Cang encouraged the boy leader to improve on the performance of his predecessors. Environmentalist Leo Mamicpic’s best advice is to let him be and allow Roel to do his job. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Taking in context, one after other, the well-intentioned counsels serve only to reinforce the public impression that Roel is a political novice not yet ready to take the mantle of provincial leadership, no different in its ramification on P-Noy’s catapult to the national presidency.</span><br><br>The IBP-Negros Oriental Governor Atty. Raymund Mercado prodded Roel to always put priority to the interest of the greater majority and rise above political patronage.  1st Dist. Rep. Josy Sy Limkaichong hewed along the same line.  She dared Roel to become an exemplary servant and continue to raise the standard of politics in our province and strive to transform Negros Oriental to greater heights by making significant strides in good governance and economic development.<br><br>Plaza Ma Luisa Suites Proprietor Christy Locsin-Bollos wanted Roel to go to the municipalities and learn personally the needs of the people.  GP Rehab Executive Director Analou Suan underscored the importance of NGO networking.  Diocese of Dumaguete Judicial Vicar Fr. Gamaliel Tulabing prayed that Roel work hand in hand with the church’s effort towards moral recovery...for a genuine human development.  Lorna Pena-Reyes Makil, a retired sociologist, noted that Roel as a Provincial Board Member in the 3rd District was very active in implementing his HELP.  HELP is the acronym of his Health & Livelihood Programs and Projects.  She inspired the Gen Xer governor to continue walking with God, listen to His counsel, and keep the faith.  And the unsolicited advice from Dumaguete Councilor Manuel R. Arbon -- let your good deeds and humble words be your form of prayer to God.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Remember the position seeks the man.  Just like President Aquino.  Just like Governor Perdices before him.  To be a Governor is Roel’s destiny. There is no higher positioning than what is done by divine decree.  Vox Dei, vox populi. God commands, man acts as an instrument of His will.  But to earn the trust of his people, Roel must learn to listen, analyze, and synthesize their unsolicited advice.  The power of good governance, the power of immersion, the power of networking, and the power of prayer are all here packaged in the unsolicited advices. Vox populi, vox Dei.  There is always potent power in a united people -- trusting and encouraging one another and building each other. Only then can his anointing as governor be deemed as dealt from heaven.  Only then can he lay claim to an Ubuntu concept--<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">I who I am  because of who we all are</span>. People power unleashed.</span><br><br>Let it be the Song of Roel.  Let it reverberate and resonate among the Oriental Negrenses here in the Province and the world-wide web.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

To ensure they would not be troubled over the welfare of their dependents during their absence, he distributed crown estates and revenues among them. When he had thus disposed of nearly all the royal resources, his friend General Perdiccas asked Alexander what he had reserved for himself.  Alexander the Great, replied,  “Hope.”  <br><br>“In that case,” said Perdiccas, “we who share in your labors will also take part in your hopes.” The General refused the estate allotted to him, and several other of the king’s friends did the same.   <br><br>We have seen through life and history that hope is a powerful reality, especially for God’s people. Hope ushers confidence and certainty.  Hope gives a positive vision towards a future that is yet unknown. Hope sets us free from the clutches of fear and grip of pessimism.  Hope brings us to an understanding that no matter what the lies ahead, the sovereignty of God will sustain us, uphold us and see us through.    <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Understanding God’s authority</span><br></div><br><br>        Genuine hope is not just optimism or positive thinking, as some people would like to believe.  Hope is having a firm understanding of God’s character, nature and purposes.  <br><br>In short, true hope cannot be birthed in a heart that refuses to humbly submit to the sovereign wisdom and power of the Lord.  Scripture calls this sense of submission as “the fear of God.”    <br><br>The word “fear” is the awe and reverence that one feels before the presence of a higher and more powerful being.  It is the sense of powerlessness and utter humility that one recognizes before one who is not and never could be our equal. <br><br>There are many expressions of our recognition of God’s authority over us.  The bottom line, however, is this: To recognize God’s authority is to believe that God can take hold of each and every circumstance and situation in our lives -- even the most tragic, the most brutal and the most devastating -- and use them all for purposes and intentions that are good, pleasing and glorifying. <br><br>This capacity of the Lord may be too much to bear or even imagine possible by the human mind, but that does not mean it cannot be done.<br><br>The world will always try to destroy our hope and make us suspicious of  the intentions of God’s authority.  The world attempts to distort our perceptions of God by misleading us to think of God as a repressive, manipulative, and egoistic Being obsessed with nothing but control and power.  <br><br>What the world can never understands is the truth that inside the very heart of God is nothing but utter purity, blameless, righteousness, justice, and truth.  There is no reason for us to think ill of the Lord or accuse God of wrong-doing.  He is good, all the time. <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Believing God’s assurances</span><br></div><br><br>        After several years in the pastoral ministry, I have come to a conclusion that hopelessness spares no one.  I have seen how people with great wealth and influence can live in unbelievable fear and anxiety when hopelessness sets in.  <br> <br>When a family member is declared terminally ill; when children turn to drugs; when marriages are tested; when financial obligations pile up beyond control, when there is betrayal; when calamities strike; when close friends take their own lives; when there is rejection and abandonment by those we love most; when dreams collapse; when failures happen too often; and when there is nowhere to turn, the spirit of hopelessness sets in so easily.   <br><br>But it is in these precious moments that God comes.   It is in these situations that we see ourselves confronting the reality of our finiteness, and eventually embracing the truth of God’s wisdom and sovereignty.  It is in these circumstances that we learn to cry out to the Lord and truly wait for redemption and help.<br><br>Even as we yet face all the uncertainties of the future,  may we all continue to believe in our hearts and confess with our mouth that there is always hope.  <br><br>God has set forth this hope in the very person and being of Jesus Christ, who is Immanuel, God who has dwelt among us!  <br><br>Let us affirm the authority of this blessed hope.  Let us proclaim unceasingly the assurance that this hope is sure and that this precious hope can never be cut off. <br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

And of course, we are its rapt audience, whether we like it or not. <br><br>Over the past few months, I have endeavored to see every single film which has been considered critically noteworthy, in an attempt to understand the film year that was 2010. In general, I thought it was a great harvest, give or take a turkey or two. <br><br>The following are my short knee-jerk responses to each one, spread over the next two months—and I do hope most of you will be able to catch these titles on the widescreen, with the hopes that the horrendous <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dalaw</span> is no longer hogging our theaters’ schedules. Enough of bad films. Let the good ones come in. <br><br>*** <br><br>I honestly thought David Fincher’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Social Network</span> [2010] was a little underwhelming, given the rave reviews and the hype that was heaped on it even before opening day. When the lights came on in the movie theater at the Metreon, I stood up and walked home to my room in The Drake in San Francisco. It was very late, and it was off to bed I went, my only concern sleep. But I knew it was a well- made movie—the direction was that of a master at the top of his game, the editing was taut and spellbinding, the writing was scintillating, the score understated but effective, the cinematography sly and somehow expansive in intimate ways, the acting superb—but I found myself somehow underwhelmed, and maybe because I expected it to bludgeon me with its greatness. (But then again, like most great art, it’s really all about subtlety.) It does not have the gimmicky and overscored finish of the top spinning in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Inception</span>, just a soft petering off of an unfinished life, a subtle ending that brings in a reverse “asshole” bookend reference that began the movie, and a lonely Mark Zuckerberg repeatedly hitting refresh on someone’s Facebook page, just to see if that someone will accept his friend request. <br><br>I expected the usual Hollywood fireworks. I forgot I was watching a David Fincher movie. Then again, maybe it was also because I watched it in a midnight screening, and my body was a little tired from all the walking I had been doing all over San Francisco. Which should not sound like such a big deal, but remember, the city is all about hills—up, down, then up again, in boots I was trying to break in. <br><br>But God, this film has such staying power in your head. Because for many hours later, I kept thinking and thinking about it. I kept replaying certain scenes in my head. I kept going back, for example, to that lingering long shot of Mark walking across Harvard campus near the beginning of the film, after he got dumped and before spending an entire drunken night hacking and making code that would soon become his Internet revenge against all Harvard women. And I kept telling myself, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">it’s all there, in that lonely walk across campus</span>. And I kept remembering certain snappy lines of dialogue, all of Aaron Sorkin’s zing like lightning in a bottle. And I kept hopping from one Internet article to the next, hoping for more insight into this film. And people like me are legions online. <br><br>It’s a great movie. The best movie I’ve seen this year. It crawls under your skin. <br><br>*** <br><br>This is the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">other</span> Facebook movie, the perfect bookend to Fincher’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Social Network</span>, the slow-burning but incredibly delicious film that has become this year’s uncanny mirror of the zeitgeist. (Most of us do live on Facebook now, right?) But while Fincher’s film is an intelligent myth-making re-imagination of Facebook’s troubled start-up, ostensibly recreating the days of Mark Zuckerberg’s life as he deals with the assorted drama of Facebook’s creation, Henry Joost and Ariel Shulman’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Catfish</span> [2010] depicts the real- life repercussions of our online interactions. The documentary follows Nev, Mr. Schulman’s brother. Nev is a New York photographer who covers the dance world, and one day he receives a painting of one of his dance photographs by a girl named Abby from a little Michigan townA friendship takes root and soon comes to involve Abby’s family—a mother named Angela, a father named Vince, a brother, Abby’s friends, and finally, a beautiful half-sister named Megan, a veterinarian who models, paints, sings, and plays the piano. Online romance ensues. And then soon after, already smitten like a boy in a long-distance love affair, Nev starts discovering that some things ... just don’t add up. <br><br>The film does start off as a kind of Facebook thriller (complemented by much use of YouTube, Gmail, GoogleMaps, iPhones, Google Earth, and the assorted online applications that have come to define our daily lives). But it ends with such quiet and devastating drama about alienation and hope, artistic manipulation, the allure of storytelling, and the slippery boundaries of identity that we use to navigate the unguarded highways of the Internet. <br><br>This reminds me of a post that I blogged (with a subsequent shorter 140-character version in Twitter) a few days ago : “Sometimes when I look at my own Facebook posts and pictures and videos and stuff, I cannot help but feel a little envy for the life that this online persona, this electronic version of me, seems to have. And of course, I feel weird feeling that.” It’s weird because the Ian Rosales Casocot online, in Facebook and elsewhere, is indeed “me”—and those are my thoughts, my photos, my videos, my life. <br><br>And yet, I am also aware that in many ways, what I am “creating” online is a persona a little removed from me—it’s the concentration of the best of who I am, the face I want to present to the world, having edited out the humdrum minutes where I just stare off into space, waiting for something to happen. It is from this acknowledgment of how we live our present-day reality that the film manages to appeal to me. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">This is happening.</span> And then there is also the film’s quiet conclusion, its statement about artists. It broke my heart, and angered me a bit—but I also found a capacity for empathy. And when we finally get to the part about the catfish of the title, everything else that comes before it makes so much sense. <br><br>But of course the film did not make sense for a lot of people who came to screenings of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Catfish</span> and expected a twisty thriller in the vein of M. Night Shyamalan. <br><br>Reading ordinary moviegoers’ comments online about the film (or its trailer) is another reason why I have a certain urge to puke over the notion of “the wisdom of the masses,” the same mass of herd-thinking people whose idea of enlightenment is the dumbing explosions of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Transformers</span> and the saccharine inanities of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Twilight</span>. <br><br>The following comment, from somebody named jocybum in YouTube, is typical of the many online posts that have been coming out: “I just watched this last night, I was so unbelievably bored and disappointed by what happens after driving to the barn scene. It was so predictable. Plus the fact that they called it a documentary and some people believe this is lolworthy” [unedited]. (A quick look at jocybum’s YouTube profile shows that he or she is 21, from the United Kingdom, and likes the following videos: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Father Christmas F*cked My Pussy (Christmas Pussy Song), He Bite me in my Vagina,</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Fart Trek: The Next Flatulation</span>. I rest my case.) <br><br>I look at that, and I feel pity. They don’t get it. Most people will not get this movie, and it’s sad. It reminds me of what the film critic Roger Ebert once wrote about similar people in his review of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey [1968]: “Man is a curious animal. He is uneasy in the face of great experiences, and if he is forced to experience something profound, he starts immediately to cheapen it, to bring it down to his own level.” (Next: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Black Swan and Howl</span> in three weeks…) <br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>When I came to this city almost two years ago intending to move here for good, I started thinking about building a house, but after talking to various people about the difficulties they had with contractors, I was quite apprehensive.  No one could give me an unqualified recommendation, but everyone was keen to tell me horror stories about huge amounts of work needing to be re-done, sub-standard workmanship and materials, and even whole walls left unbuilt because they were not included in the contract.  It was nerve-wracking even to contemplate it all, although my expectations were not unreasonable.  I wanted good quality work, clean aesthetics, structural integrity and functionality; no more, no less.<BR><BR>But after a ten-month project, I can honestly attest that although it required my daily involvement, it was not nearly as difficult as I has feared.  One of the major reasons for the success was that we chose a very competent and trustworthy contractor.<BR><BR>So, what are the good qualities that we look for in a contractor?  First, he or she should have a solid understanding of construction engineering, not just in theory but in practice,  so of course, experience is important.  A good sense of style and design is key, so that they can provide guidance, when appropriate.  Your contractor must have good management skills, which means knowing how to deal fairly with employees, to manage conflicts, and treating them with respect and dignity, being assertive but not petty. They must have a foreman that they can trust and delegate authority to. He/she must have a calm personality, be open to reasonable suggestions and changes, and have the capacity, the passion and the commitment to the project.<BR><BR>Of course, sometimes projects don’t have such happy endings.  It’s always easy to blame contractors, and surely there are times when they are at fault.  But customers must bear in mind that they too may contribute to the complete or partial failure of a project.  They may not have used good judgment in selecting a contractor.  Blinded by excitement and in a rush to start, they may be too quick to accept a recommendation, and not take the time to look at the contractor’s other projects and talk to their previous customers.  Another fatal mistake is lack of presence.  Although errors and misunderstandings are inevitable, their impact can be minimized if they are caught right away, or even before they are made. <BR><BR>Another key factor in the success of our project was that we had a very complete contract, but also maintained an atmosphere of trust in our dealings with our contractor.  She trusted us not to make unreasonable demands, and we trusted her to be as flexible as possible regarding changes to the plans, provided those changes didn’t affect her bottom line too adversely.  The contract should be iron-clad, but without trust, no amount of paper will protect you, and an adversarial, aggressive relationship with your contractor will almost certainly backfire.<BR><BR>I count myself very lucky to have survived a non-theatrical, uneventful but rigorous construction process, from which emerged the house I had dreamed of.  I must thank our contractor, Engr. Geronica Sinco-Martinez, and her highly competent crew of skilled workers, who made it possible for me to learn and to appreciate the art of construction.

   "body": "<BR>This is downtown Dumaguete as I first saw it, more than ten years ago.  I took the picture on an ordinary afternoon, sitting on the steps in front of Lee Plaza.  It was  hot; the sun glared down on the street like a death ray, broiling the pavement. But the women you see here were used to it, and strode forward about their business without concern. <BR><BR>The city has changed somewhat since then. The most obvious difference is the traffic. In this picture the streets look almost empty compared to today.  And there are very few private cars or motorcycles to be seen; only Pedicabs.<BR><BR>At that time there were fewer stores, and smaller ones. Where Robinson’s mall now stands, there was only an empty field full of cows. There was  no McDonalds, no KFC. There were no internet cafes, no cell phones. If you wanted to talk to someone, you had to go and find that actual 3D person in  the flesh, probably at their house. <BR><BR>And to get to somebody’s house, you had to ride on many unpaved roads, and, when it rained, mostly on mud. And even mild rain or wind would almost guarantee a power failure. In many ways Dumaguete was a just a sleepy college town. <BR><BR>But perhaps because of that, public events were more anticipated, and had a more intense effect on everyday life than they do now. During the Dumaguete Fiest, or the Santa Cruzan, everyone in the city stopped dead for days to celebrate. <BR><BR>Today, many people are so glued to the glare of laptops, so lost in the flux of cell phones and social networks with their groups of  “friends” --that they are often hardly aware of  their physical surroundings, much less of local public events.<BR><BR>Dumaguete, like every town, changes-- but also stays the same. There are more people now, with more cars on the streets- but still with no traffic lights; and so, with constant traffic jams. There are internet cafes everywhere, but the internet is often as slow as syrup; there are fewer brownouts, but they still happen, and then all the networks crash.<BR><BR>But as things change, people find ways to manage, or at least to ignore, the new problems that arise. Dumaguete, seen here ten years ago, is still the same place. And people here still move on through their private lives without concern.<BR><BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport1-30.jpeg\"><BR><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

The City has been de-clogging canals without letup and in addition, trees have been pruned to prevent branches from falling on motorists or pedestrians. There may be other steps that are being done which we do not know of.<BR><BR>But we also cannot help but voice concern over some things that we see. There are people living on top of the Tubod creek, as well as along the riverbanks, or on dry river beds.<BR><BR>By doing so, these people endanger themselves when the floods do come. <BR><BR>And when it does come, the government will have to deal with an urgent problem of rescuing them, and providing them with resettlement areas.<BR><BR>The best part, however, is that all these potential problems caused by informal settlers could be avoided by prohibiting them from living there in the first place.<BR><BR>The cities of Cebu and Mandaue, which had long tolerated the presence of informal settlers in its waterways, learned this lesson the hard way last week when they were forced to declare a state of calamity after a two-hour rainfall flooded many of their barangays. Now, they are embarking on a program to return those settlers to their places of origin.<BR>We don’t have to wait for that time to happen to Dumaguete City. We can prevent that from happening today.

   "body": "<BR><BR>Many people are asking why the Philippines, which is situated in the center of the world’s marine biodiversity, is suffering from rapidly declining fisheries. <BR><BR>One would expect that the country’s diverse marine ecosystems known to have high productivity would provide sufficient fishery resources to support the human population. <BR><BR>Indeed, our research shows that coral reef fisheries are resilient, except when highly destructive fishing methods are used.  This leads us to inquire into the causes of this state of affairs.<BR><BR>It is known that the country compared to our neighbor Thailand, which is similar to the Philippines in terms of land area and natural resources, has a larger population growth rate. <BR><BR>The result is that the Philippines has a much larger population than Thailand. This larger population exerts a larger pressure on the resources compared to Thailand.<BR><BR>One result of this larger population has been the rapid expansion of fisheries. The fisheries have also been under increasing pressure from international market demands. Live fish are being exported to other Asian nations with expanding economies. <BR><BR>The local and international market demands are the major drivers of the heavy exploitation of fisheries, often with the use of illegal and/or destructive fishing techniques (e.g., dynamite blasting, chemical poisons, muro-ami drive-in technique) that destroy the benthic environment such as corals. <BR><BR>Thus, the productive marine habitats of the country are being degraded, posing a threat to food security of the people.<BR><BR>Despite the support of funding agencies such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the USAID, the ability of local, regional and national governments to fully manage Philippine marine resources has been limited. This is often due to lack of political will and the failure to invest local funds for resource management to sustain management effort after the initial financial support of development agencies has ceased. <BR><BR>Most management efforts at the local, regional and national levels are short-lived. <BR><BR>Thus, coastal and marine ecosystems and marine biodiversity continue to degrade and poverty levels in coastal areas continue to persist.<BR><BR>It has been shown by research that recovery of depleted marine fisheries takes decades (not years) of protection and management. <BR><BR>So efforts at rehabilitation of depleted fisheries and degraded marine habitats must be sustained for long periods of time, and government must invest resources for management after the withdrawal of foreign support. What has happened is that government has failed to provide the needed support for sustained management and protection.<BR><BR>Even if funds were available, the mechanisms of management are problematic. <BR><BR>Take for example coral reef fisheries, the only regulations that exist are bans or limitations on certain techniques of fishing that are destructive to the benthic habitats such as explosives, muro-ami drive-in net, bottom trawl, and use of cyanide on coral reefs. No limits are imposed on volume of catch, fishing effort, or sizes of fish landed -- the traditional methods used in developed nations. Even in developed nations, these control mechanisms are less than impressive, and on a global scale overexploitation of fisheries resources remains rife. It is no wonder that fishery scientists have concluded that global fisheries are in serious trouble.  <BR><BR>One mechanism of marine conservation and fisheries management that has a proven record of acceptance among coastal peoples of the Philippines is the implementation of coral reef no-take marine reserves. <BR><BR>No-take marine reserves are areas of the marine environment fully protected from various forms of human or extractive exploitation, such as fishing.  <BR><BR>A major reason for the acceptance is that no-take marine reserves can deliver, often rapidly, financial benefits to local fishing communities through tourism receipts. <BR><BR>Another reason is their positive visible effects on fish abundance after a period of time. With the adoption of programs on integrated coastal and marine resources management recently, no-take marine reserves has become the central essential feature of this comprehensive management approach.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

This  is  the seventh  PHDR  since the first  came off the press in  1994.   <br><br> That  launched  a  now 15-year effort by Filipino  academicians to civil society leaders to break out of  conventional  one-dimensional  yardsticks. <br><br>Gross domestic  product, for  example, divides  national wealth by population.  Results  bracket  the beggar in rubber flip-flops with an Imelda Marcos strutting  diamond tiaras.<br><br>Banco Sentral  tracks  Overseas Filipino Workers remittances, over $18 billion at last count.  But  balance sheets can’t tally   psychological  savaging of  eight millions kids, where a salary check  substitutes for an OFW parent, says  a two- year study by  Scalabrini Migration Center and the  Commission on Filipinos Overseas. <br><br>It  covers 30 provinces and two  migrant communities in Italy and Spain.<br><br>To  capture  reality,   PHDR  tacked on gauges for knowledge, health and standard of living. A human development index (HDI)  resulted, former NEDA chair  Solita Collas Monsod  recalls.  Their initial use showed up “disparities in the country’s human development by region”.  <br><br>Trailing Metro Manila,  Western Mindanao was slightly better off than Zimbabwe. She foresaw  need for crafting of  future HDIs on  various questions, from governance to empowerment of people.”<br><br>Traditional  economic  measures   answer “what  sets the price of toothpaste”, the late Mahbub ul Haq of UN and  later  World Bank would muse..But  posing the  “right questions”  is more critical.  <br><br>These  questions  swirl around  hunger,  education, security, human  aspirations even, agreed 1998 Nobel Laureate Amartya  Sen. ”We need a measure that is not as blind to social aspects as  GNP is.”<br><br>Sen and  Haq at UNDP led  scientists in stitching  HDI gauges in the maiden  issue of the global  Human  Development Report  in 1990.“ People are the real  wealth of a nation,” their lead  sentence read.  Today’s   20th  anniversary issue of  HDR reiterates  that  theme.<br><br>This measurement innovation continues. Three new gauges – extreme deprivation, gender disparities and  inequalities – are tacked  into  this year’s edition.<br><br>PHDRs mounted  parallel   efforts “in search of a human face”.  They  added  a  “Human Poverty Index”  This  measures  deprivation beyond income. Life expectancy is buttressed  with tables on “probability at birth of not surviving to age 40. <br><br>Knowledge is gauged not merely by enrolment. They’re supplemented  by adult illiteracy  and graduation rates.  PHDRs  report percentages of people who drink from open easily-contaminated wells to underweight kids below five. <br><br>Masbate slumps to number 72 out of  77 provinces  in “Human Poverty”. Pangasinan ranks as No. 9.   Analytical  breakdown  by provinces shows up other smudged  disparities.  <br><br>La Union, for example , now has the longest life expectancy at 74.6 years. Life is “nasty, brutish and short” in  Tawi-Tawi at  53.4 years <br><br>Earlier  reports  also   compare HDIs between  countries and provinces.  Azerbijan on one end and Paraguay on the other,  for instance,  sandwich  Batanes, Laguna, Bataan, Batangas, La Union and Pampanga.”<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">In  Search of  a Human Face</span> updates issues that  earlier PHDRs covered. The 1997 report on gender documented gains, by women, in education, jobs and elections – and constraints. The 2000  report  focused  on erosion  in quality of  education and outlined reforms.  <br><br>The  2002  report  dealt with  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Work and Well Being</span>.   As  insurgency surged, the 2005 report dealt with  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Human Security and  Armed Conflict</span>. The 2009 theme dealt with how  institutions and politics impact on human development.<br><br>The  new tools  are “a  major step… in what has been characterized as a ‘noisy democracy’,” National Scientist Gelia Castillo wrote. “If an indie film were to be made on Philippine human development, what would be the story line and images?”<br><br>  For an answer, Castillo whips out a table that compares  placid  Benguet  with  Manguidanao, bloodied  by massacres, sapped by  Internal Revenue Allotment wastage,  and studded with 24  luxurious Ampatuan  mansions.<br><br>  Functional illiteracy in Maguindanao is four times that of Benguet.  Primary and high school enrolment in Benguet, at  94 percent,  towers over Maguindanao’s  75 percent.  Only four out of  10  Maguindanaoans get high school diplomas,  Benguet’s   is double that.<br><br>Almost half (46 percent) of Maguindanao homes  draw water from murky wells. Stack that against 14 percent for  Benguet. Thus, a  Maguindanaoan’s life expectancy is 57.6 years, similar to Lanao del Sur.  Life in contrast, life  spans  in Benguet  approximate that of Cebu. <br><br>As a result, overall HDI tables for 77 provinces  reveal Benguet in  slot No. 8. Maguindanao limps in as second to the last. <br><br>“Elites in our country live, on average almost a generation longer than the poor,” the late National Scientist  Dioscoro Umali wrote 20 years back. “Many  ask the bitter – but justified – question: Have the affluent acquired a franchise to life?”<br><br>PHDR has  not addressed (so far) “the  hidden accouterment of absolute control by those in power over  local populace, with support of  the highest central  authority.” Dr  Castillo points out. Human development must grow in our “own backyards’. The daily lives of citizens is “where it’s human face must shine most…Can we find fitting indicators?”<br><br>Will  policymakers  use these  new indices? For now, the tools   make us repeat what the orphan boy, in the  1958 flim classic tells the Crucified: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tiene cara de hambre.</span> “You have the face of  hunger.”.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

One news item I saw had him saying that driving a Porsche would give him a reason to smile.  On which roads, one wonders.<br><br>Switzerland consistently figures among the Top 6 or 7 countries with the highest gross national product per capita income.  For a small country, it has a strong and diversified economy based on highly developed industry, trade, agriculture, tourism, not to forget its famous/notorious banking sector.  <br><br>Its citizens and residents live well, assured of political stability, and almost every needed social service.  The economic elite can indulge their penchant for luxury if they so wish,  without any fuss from less-privileged segments of society.  <br><br>At most,  perhaps some few  politically- correct people may look with disdain at the  self-indulgence of the rich.   <br><br>It’s obviously a totally different world in the context of high income inequality in the Philippines,  when at least half of the population is poor, where hunger rates are tracked, where access to potable water, basic health care, and all the rest of the human development indices are very far from acceptable.  <br><br>In such a context, no one should indulge in unconscionable spending for luxury, tantamount to a slap in the face of the poor.  <br><br>P.Noy  gets bad marks for lack of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">delicadeza</span> at the least, and worse,  lack of solidarity  with the majority of the people he has committed to serve.<br><br>But there’s also the odd matter of P.Noy caving in to the stereotypical urge for male high-status toys, in this case an expensive, sporty, high performance car, consistently awarded as “most prestigious brand.” <br>  <br>Somehow, his past public behavior led me, mistakenly it seems,  to expect he’d know better or could see through the immaturity of such an impulse.  <br><br>Of course, women, too,  soft targets of advertising for luxury brands and goods that imply or promise raised status, generally cave in. With women, there may be an added aspect of conscious or unconscious attempts to overcome the gender’s “second-class”  social status.   <br><br>The luxury industry is certainly a strong economic sector in some countries, creating products, jobs and turning large profits. In Switzerland, it’s luxury watches,  jewelry,  and even ski resorts for the rich.  <br><br>This week, the World Economic Forum is taking place in the chic ski resort of Davos, that annual gathering of chief executives, government leaders, academics, and other public figures who debate and propose remedies to the world’s economic ills.<br><br>Among today’s headlines is one about the surge in income inequality in many countries, including in developed countries, where economic elites “pull even farther ahead “ from the majority of their compatriots.  <br><br>Nothing new to us in the Philippines where the disparity between rich and poor seems to grow. <br><br>P.Noy’s spending millions of pesos on a luxury toy was a stark and ill-considered demonstration of that disparity he should be committed to eradicate.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Sinco through a manifesto sent out to heads of 73 institutions of higher learning seeking their support is strengthened by developments in the education and sports communities in this University Town and in other parts of the country.<br><br>Locally, the first to profess support was NORSU President Dr. Henry Sojor. This is significant because the PRISAA chairperson “for life” and former CHED chairperson Dr. Manny Angeles wants to integrate the State Colleges & University Athletic Association (SCUAA)into what he is marketing and promoting as a National Collegiate Games.<br><br>It is believed this is a ploy of Angeles to create a mass-based support for a party-list he calls A Party Representative of Indigent Student Athletes (APRISA) which he fielded in the last elections, with his son as the first nominee-representative. <br><br>Interestingly, APRISA garnered some 25,000 votes, but not enough to send his son to Congress. <br><br>Silliman University President Dr. Ben Malayang had responded to Dr. Sinco’s letter saying he will convene a committee to discuss the issues contained in the manifesto.

I don’t know how this happened…suffice it to say that whatever is happening, the guys behind First PRISA are using the PRISAA to build a network of members throughout the country…there is no doubt the people they have listed as their regional representatives are the same regional presidents of the local PRISAA…Right now, we—along with several other members schools—are thinking of withdrawing our membership from PRISAA, lest we be used for the political interest of others without our knowledge or consent.”</span><br><br>Peachy Moraleda is now leading the boycott campaign in the Bicol region in the company of Fr. Joel Tabora of Ateneo de Naga University and Sr. Asuncion Evidente of the Universidad de Sta. Isabel.  <br><br>She informed me in an email: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Here in Naga City, there are only six PRISAA member schools: UNEP, Ateneo, USI, University of Nueva Caseres, Naga College Foundation and CCDI. If Ateneo and USI will withdraw membership along with our school UNEP and CCDI (which is also owned by our family), it will only be NCF and UNC that are left.” </span><br><br>On Jan. 21, Peachy forwarded to me an email of Father Tabora: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“The issues raised in this manifesto reflect my concerns about PRISAA. I have been in conversation with Mr. Jec Claro for a pull-out from the PRISAA…”</span><br><br>The latest developments I have received through text messages and emails are: a)  from a PSC commissioner: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“We are not supporting PRISAA” (Jan. 24), b) from a sports official: “Angeles is having a hard time getting billeting areas in Manila. He is calling a special board meeting on Feb. 5 in Cebu City for a change of venue from Metro Manila to Region 9, Zamboanga City.”</span> (Jan. 27).<br><br>With Cebu as the site of this meeting called my Angeles, I presume that Ryan Aznar of Southwestern University and Fr. Vic Uy of Holy Name University in Bohol, secretary and president of PRISAA Region 7, respectively, would play hosts. These two personalities were not elected by member-schools in the Region but were appointed by Angeles. <br><br>Hence, for the sake of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">delicadeza</span>, and because Negros Oriental as a member is in the forefront of the campaign to boycott the PRISAA national games, I beliebe Aznar and Father Uy should refrain from hosting the meeting called by Angeles. The appropriate host for such a meeting is the PRISAA President in Zamboanga City or Region 9 (Western Mindanao). <br><br>As I put the finishing touches in this piece, I received an email signed by Bro. Raymundo B. Suplido, president and chancellor of USLS-Bacolod, indicating their full support of the planned boycott. <br><br>This will mean that the USLS, with 70 athletes and coaches qualifying to represent Region 6 in volleyball women, tae-kwon-do women, table tennis men, lawn tennis men, badminton women, karatedo women, swimming, and athletics will manifest the supreme sacrifice of not going to the games after a year of hard training. <br><br>Ditto for the athletes of the University of San Agustin in Iloilo and St. Louis University in Baguio. We salute this grand sacrifice of the athletes belonging to religious and sectarian institutions. <br><br>FU will not send its regional champion men’s beach volleyball team, and its qualifier in athletics. We hope that Silliman University will likewise join this campaign where coaches and athletes, in accepting to undergo the sacrifice of not participating in a national competition they have prepared for, will learn to fight and correct what is perceived as a wrong committed by those who profess to be teachers of the young.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

We are all now facing major adjustments in the way we live as problems multiply due to our degraded environment. <br><br>There is a consensus  among scientists that even our best efforts are rather late as we cannot reverse the damage but we can aim  to stabilize the amount of warming to 20C. <br><br>Impacts of our changing climate bring more floods, longer droughts, ocean acidification that leads to disruption of marine ecosystems, and death of coral reefs which Negros Oriental is famous for. <br><br>The vulnerability of the people in our Province is higher as many live near the coast, and our reliance on our once- rich marine natural resource is substantially cutting our economy. <br><br>Although we face uncertainties, we can change our attitude and learn how to help. As advocates of environmental governance,  students and teachers of the SU School of Public Affairs & Governance trooped to Lake Balinsasayao on Jan. 22 for an orientation on how Negros Oriental’s provincial leaders and civic organizations are partnering to act together and inform the public how to adapt to the changing climate, and be better equipped.<br><br>Appealing for  support, Master of Environmental Governance students Lucena Amaro, Vera Villaflores, Roberto Amaro, Prime Caingcoy, and Gena Dayon presented reports on the the Province’s status of endemic species biodiversity, and the critical issues affecting our coastal resources. <br><br>Brief presentations of the importance of Watershed Conservation and Management, Effects of Anthropogenic Activities in the Timberlands, Climate Change, Negros Oriental’s Threatened Wildlife, and the Coral Reef Ecosystem Services were highlighted.<br><br>Lake Balinsasayao is  a forest watershed consisting of 8,016 hectares of protected area, according to Vicky Mari who oversees the natural park, a national protected area under the National Integrated Protected Areas System. <br><br>This watershed  is  the Province’s main rain forest ecosystem that plays a critical role in sustaining the variety of plant and animal life in the Province,  Negros being  the center of biodiversity in the country.  <br><br>Villaflores stressed in her report that Negrenses need  to identify roles in the management of our natural resources as current policy and practice have not halted destruction.  She highlighted the fact that maintaining the fragile health and biodiversity of Lake Balinsasayo will provide us with resources to help prevent global warming.<br><br>In his report, Robert Amaro said that the value of a 50-year old tree is about $183,230.  This summation was broken down by the specific services a single tree of this age does in producing oxygen, controlling pollution and soil erosion. <br><br>Thus, a single tree can support over 100 different species of plants and animals. <br><br>Unfortunately, he noted, our trees are being cut at a rate that the forests are, by themselves, classified as endangered. The greater concern is that only four percent of the rainforest ecosystem in Negros is left, as of 2004.<br><br>The elusive goal of sustainability can be attained if more people participate in a collaborative process so they can empower government institutions tasked to protect the Province’s rainforest ecosystem, but which are perceived to have been unable to do their mandate.<br><br>People can start by acquiring a deep knowledge how a global life-sustaining natural resource can do. Clean air, an abundant water supply, and all other myriad services performed by healthy forests are benefits that we are now losing.<br><br>While the Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) program has devolved power to the community,  this concept to enable local control and give property rights has not been effective. <br><br>Facts reveal that resource rights remain largely with the Department of Environment & Natural Resources.  As stakeholders, people can help manage our natural resources in the pursuit of sustainability, and campaign to stop poaching, logging, and other exploitation such as mining, which the DENR is currently processing for companies like  Kolinsky Mining Corp.in the municipalities of Zamboanguita and Siaton. <br><br>The task of developing, articulating, and responding to the issues of ecological viability indeed need our sincere participation if we are to survive the changing climate at all.  <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Gena Dayon</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Siaton, Negros Oriental</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Burnham prepared the master plan of Manila for a population of 800,000. The city’s population in 1903 was only 223,029.<br><br>The plan was to make Manila a city of natural and architectural wonders complemented with parks and plazas with fountains that add to the charm and refreshment of the value of the park—very much like the city of Rome.<br><br>The plan for the city of Manila was truly something grand, and as Burnham would put it,  “…Pearl of the Orient”.  <br><br>Unfortunately, only a fraction of his plan was carried out.<br><br>Dumaguete City is on the same road, not until we recognize that urbanization is really about the physical environment, nature or man-made:  visually pleasing (at most times exhilarating), functional, livable, and eco-friendly.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Ned Carlos</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Principal architect </span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Carlos & Antique Architects</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

When a country with extreme geographic, tribal, and social-class differences, like the Philippines, has only a weak offsetting sense of national unity, its public life does become the war of every man against every man.” If you look at the confusing variety of political parties in the country, and the resulting divisiveness of conflicting vertical ties the people have to these politicians, one can’t help but agree.<br><br>Joaquin writes: “We don’t grow like a seed, we split like an amoeba.” Joaquin says, “The decentralization and barrio-autonomy movement expresses our craving to return to the one unit of society we feel adequate to: the barangay, with its 30 to a hundred families. Anything larger intimidates. We would deliberately limit ourselves to the small performance. This attitude, an immemorial one, explains why we’re finding it so hard to become a nation, and why our pagan forefathers could not even imagine the task.”  <br><br>The fact that Quijano de Manila wrote this essay in the ‘60s and the ‘landmark’ Local Government Code (RA 7160) was passed in 1991 gives us pause to remember that Jose Rizal had asked this simple question to those who came to request him during his exile in Dapitan to formally endorse the revolution against Spain:  “And what will you do with our freedom once we have it?”  So it seems that while we know what our limiting factor is, we still embrace and even institutionalized it.  <br><br>The Local Government Code is considered to be a great piece of legislation, but on the flip-side, many of its provisions have yet to be implemented.<br><br>Fallows wrote:  “The tradition of political corruption and cronyism, the extremes of wealth and poverty, the tribal fragmentation, the local elite’s willingness to make a separate profitable peace with colonial powers—all reflect a feeble sense of nationalism and a contempt for the public good.  Practically everything that is public in the Philippines seems neglected or abused.”  <br><br>While I was at the Development Academy of the Philippines for the master in public management program, we had a guest lecturer from Australia, Dr. Raul Pertierra who pointed out that many Filipinos who own cars do not have the space in their residence for a garage—and so they habitually park it outside on the street. <br><br>Among other things, this leads to congestion because typically in the Philippines, we have narrow streets.  Dr. Pertierra called this as “privatization of the public domain”—appropriating the use of the public road to serve as a private garage.  Could we have a law similar to Singapore’s on this matter? It’s highly unlikely.<br><br>It is common knowledge that we have a lot of laws that are “un-implementable”—chiefly because of the lack of resources.  And perhaps lack of political will.  And when combined with the lack of foresight and proper coordination, we get anarchy.  <br><br>Street humps are a common sight because Filipino drivers do not observe traffic rules (which are mere ‘suggestions’ rather than rules, so the joke goes)—and traffic is, of course, a nightmare.  <br><br>And what is the attitude of most Filipinos?  An unnamed American, quoted by Fallows, said:  “This is a country where the national ambition is to change your nationality.”  <br><br>But our sense of humor would seem to take the edge off that observation: as we get on in age, we gain our “dual citizenship”—as Filipino citizens and senior citizens!<br><br>What does all this signify to Negrenses and Dumagueteños?   When I was still at Silliman, there was once a controversy started by a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Weekly Sillimanian</span> editorial that depicted Sillimanians at that time as being “contented cows”. <br>  <br>If we are unworried about our own political and economic state of affairs but are alarmed over the “inconvenient truth” of global warming, then we should recall that Al Gore cited in his talks on global warming a quotation from Sir Winston Churchill:  “The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. In its place we are entering a period of consequences.” (Nov. 12, 1936)  <br><br>And even if we discount Fallows’ and Joaquin’s takes on the Philippine condition as just pessimistic, we know we cannot avoid the consequences of our actions (or inactions) and choices.<br><br>Thus, taking off from this cue, the challenges on the provincial and other levels, in the political, economic, environmental and other dimensions—all are inter-related, and share a common impact point: on the lives of people.  Though we may be caught “between a rock and a very hard place” and yet are still able to celebrate a moral and ‘nationalistic’ victory in the successes of Manny Pacquiao and proudly thrill to the conquests of Charice Pempengco on the world stage, what does it really matter?  <br><br>Only to the extent that it should allow us to “pull together” instead of pulling each other apart; and for sure it’s going to be a very long and tedious process. Perhaps that’s the price we have to pay for EDSA I and II.  After all, so they say, “Rome was not built in one day.”  <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Carlos “Charlie Brown” Bueno</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"></span><a href=\"mailto:caloy.bueno@gmail.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">caloy.bueno@gmail.com</span></a><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Aside from the slideshows that  explained what climate change means,the pupils also watched a  “waste management” performance of the Youth Advocates through Theater & Arts (YATTA) which delved on the need to reduce, reuse, recycle, and recover.<BR><BR>From that experience, the children applied their gained knowledge into creating their own fashion from used clothes -- which they presented at the grand opening of the learning center in Siit.<BR><BR> Also in observance of International Volunteers Day, the BLCLC team went on a two-hour Fun Walk along the coast of Siaton to  plant mangroves in the denuded areas.   <BR><BR>The children were first briefed that a mangrove area is a valuable ecosystem because it serves as a breeding ground for fish and crustaceans, and also helps clean the water.<BR><BR>The next step for BLCLC is to get the villagers to join them in their crusade to help save the environment in their small ways.   The children are currently working on an environmental play, tackling the main question, “Where is our world now?”  The children are encouraged to use their creativity and write their own script.  The play will be presented to the community on Feb. 12 at the Bonbonon Barangay Hall.

Summer period usually starts from March and lasts until April, while typhoon season begins June until December.<BR><BR>The cold weather caused by La Nina has brought more rains than usual in the country as of last quarter of 2010. Records show that the Philippines experienced more rainfall than usual from October to December last year.  <BR><BR>Culi warned residents, especially those living along riverbanks and sloped areas, to be alert whenever rains occur. “Once it starts to rain, they should observe and take notice if it gets continuous or develops into a heavy downpour and if it does, they should be ready to take the necessary precautions like moving to higher and safer ground,” he said. <BR><BR>The Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC) here in a report identified the following areas as landslide-prone: Canlaon City, Manjuyod to Himamampangon, Bais City to Mabinay, Dauis to Mabinay, and Mabinay to Bayawan City. <BR><BR>On the other hand, the identified typhoon-prone areas are Vallehermoso, Guihulngan, La Libertad, Jimalalud, Tayasan, Ayungon and Bindoy while the flood-prone areas are Vallehermoso, Guihulngan, La Libertad, Tayasan, Bindoy, Manjuyod, Bais City, Tanjay City, Zambonguita, Siaton, Sta.

Balak, Balitaw ug Uban pa sa Tempurahan, Feb. 11 (7 pm, Tempurahan at Rizal Boulevard) Balitaw queen Enriquita Alcaide, with YATTA members as well as students of the Dumaguete Science High School, perform their own brand of the traditional form of balitaw. Balak winners from last year’s provincial festivities will be featured as well as a sprinkling of Visayan and Tagalog song. Select images of celebrated photographers Hersley Ven Casero and Alma Alcoran will fuse with contemporary poetry in a multi-media presentation. <BR><BR>4. Kulay at Hugis, Feb. 19-26, (Robinsons Place Dumaguete) Some of the best visual artists in the region come together for a public art exhibition at the Robinsons Place Dumaguete. On its last day, a Collaborative Painting Competition designed for children will be spearheaded by the Oriental Negros Children Advocacy Network.<BR><BR>5. Hinabi NegOr, Feb. 24 (2 pm, Negros Oriental Convention Center) Renowned artists, leaders and scholars speak and reflect on “how the arts have sustained the life of our communities”, with a keynote address by Malou Jacob, an accomplished playwright and executive director of the National Commission for Culture & the Arts. <BR><BR>This year’s Kisaw shall carry the theme Buhing Mugna (Arts Sustaining Life). As Ian Casocot aptly expounds, “Art sustains life. It is its beautiful gravity and soul, the creative manifestation of everything that we are as a people—our aspirations, our goodness and our frailties, our experiences and histories through the prism of the beautiful and the provocative. Art enriches the human, and becomes the portal for creative expression, whether one is an artist or an art lover. Without art, we do not have a mirror of our humanity.”<BR><BR>For more information, text or call 0917-794-9901.

Billiones was arrested in a buy-bust operation by operatives from the National Bureau of Investigation, Philippine Drug Enforcement Administration and the Dumaguete City Police Station last May 2007 for selling .6 grams of shabu to a policeman posing as a buyer.<BR><BR>The Court gave weight to  the testimonies of SPO1 Douglas Ferrer and PO3 Allen June Germodo, eyewitnesses to the transaction, to be clear, straightforward and worthy of credence.  <BR><BR>The accused tried to wiggle himself out of the case by claiming that the informant-poseur buyer was not presented in Court.  The court ruled that the non-presentation of the informant-poseur buyer cannot prejudice the prosecution’s theory of the case.  As a rule, it is rare for the prosecutor to present the informant because of the need to hide the latter’s identity and preserve his invaluable service to the police, the Court said. <BR><BR>Billiones was also sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of d after he was also found guilty of illegal possession of 0.81 gram of Marijuana leaves, stalks and seeds, a dangerous drug, contained in one rolled paper, which was found inside a Tupperware container which the accused threw away after he scuffled with the operatives when he was about to be arrested after the buy-bust operation.  <BR><BR>The accused ran to a nearby house where he hid until he was persuaded by neighbors to surrender.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA --  Hardly has Roel Ragay Degamo warmed his seat up as the new provincial governor when the first blast of fire baptism hit him.  <br><br>As he started to fill up sensitive positions at provincial capitol, his political party intervened.  The intervention effectively stopped Roel dead in his track, a few days only after he announced to the public his appointments of Arnel Francicso as Provincial Administrator, and Atty. Richard Enojo as Provincial Attorney.  <br><br>His Party wants experienced, tested, and reliable persons filling up the sensitive positions. <br><br>This early in his stewardship of the provincial leadership, he is already placed on the hot seat watched by the public eye struggling with the Gordian Knot.  <br><br>As the newest <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">MetroPost</span> columnist aptly describes it, people in Roel-like situation is to be caught in “between the rock and a hard place”. Will he be like Alexander the Great who just sliced it with his sword?  Or will he be like President Manuel L. Quezon who in his inaugural address declared “my loyalty to my party ends where my loyalty to the country begins.”<br><br>President Quezon made the quotable declaration at a time in Philippine History when a two-party system --  the Nacionalista and Liberal -- existed with concrete platforms to command and make the members’ loyalty worthwhile.   <br><br>Now there are only porous platforms of pseudo-political parties with political butterflies or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">balimbings</span> as members. The Party is built around a powerful or popular political figure as the Partido Lakas Tao of President Fidel Ramos, the Partido Masang Pilipino of President Joseph Estrada, and the Partido Lakas Kampi of President Glorial M. Arroyo.  <br><br>Now they are in limbo.  Easy come, easy go.  Nowadays, they come a dime by the dozen making party loyalty utterly meaningless and useless. <br><br>To the politically-mature Filipinos, party loyalty rings hollow, and will be invoked only by a would-be puppeteer who would like to dictate the acts and voice of the new governor. Ergo, if there is to be any political party at the provincial capitol it should be built around the person in power, just like the Partido Kasaligan at the Dumaguete City Hall of then Mayor Tuting Perdices.<br><br>It is refreshing to note that Roel is standing firm on his initial appointments in upholding man’s inherent power to choose.  He is grateful for the party support in winning as a provincial board member.   <br><br>He believes though that his becoming governor is not a party design or agenda but an act of Divine Providence.  To deprive him of the power to choose his trusted men is to divide, a devious inclination of a puppeteer to subtract and subtract repeatedly until a person becomes a non-entity or a puppet merely.  <br><br>It is well for Roel to pursue good governance unobstructed by political debts.  He owes it to the people of Negros Oriental to remain faithful to the divine design.  <br><br>To be in denial mode, to negate it is risk, a Fall far worse than losing the good will of a political benefactor.<br><br>However, to leave Roel alone in the governance of the Province is to ensure failure.  The people should be with him all the way through thick and thin in blazing a bright future for the succeeding generations.  <br><br>An effective governance needs the unqualified and enduring support of the people.  A vibrant and compassionate society is the sum total of the talents, grits, and character  of its people.  <br><br>Roel needs a clear vision, he has to craft with his trusted men, as a rallying point for his people.  Guaranteeing and delivering the right to health, adequate housing, sufficient food, quality education, and justice are daunting tasks too overwhelming for one man alone.  <br><br>Earlier on, Hector “Tata” Villanueva of Bais City advised the young Governor to “do right, and fear no one except God.”  <br><br>No stranger to politics himself, Tata may have the uncanny sense of telling that this was forthcoming.  Perhaps, but his exhortation is still easier said than done.  <br><br>Negros Oriental IBP Gov. Raymund Mercado had the same foreboding as he forewarned the neophyte Governor “to rise above political patronage.”  “Raising the standard of provincial politics” is a parallel phrase from 1st Dist. Congresswoman Josy Sy Limkaichong. <br><br>Confronted by the dilemma, there is where Roel needs breathing space as environmentalist Leo Mamicpic advised all of us “to let him be and allow Roel to do his job”.<br><br>There is hope. There is reality.  Hope that we do right now with a new and young provincial leadership.  Sucked by reality is obliquely admitting that for too long, we have been mired with traditional politics (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">trapo</span>) that stinks to high heavens, and all the way from Imperial Manila down to her vassal provinces.  <br><br>We hope that with the unwitting turnover of leadership from the Builder to Gen X, we, united as constituents of NegOr, can go it alone in carving our future freed from the corrupting ways, and anchored, set apart on His path of righteousness.  <br>He is the man on the move. He is on the public radar screen. Roel Ragay Degamo. He is Ro(e)land with a mission to make Negros Oriental a famous land.  <br><br>That is to exclaim as Robert Browning,  “Ah, but a man’s reach should exceed his grasp, or what’s a heaven for?”  <br><br>Let it be the Song of Roel and the Oriental Negrenses. Let Roel say it again, “I am who I am because of who we all are.”  <br><br>United Oriental Negrenses will stand. Possibilities are endless.  Divided, we fall as possibility is nil.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. <sup>4</sup>They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths. <sup>5</sup>But you, keep your head in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry. 2 Timothy 2: 1-5</span><br><br>We had quite a sobering scenario in Silliman last Jan. 18.  Inside the main sanctuary of the Church were the remains of Mrs. Filomena T. Cang, a well-respected woman of God whose life of integrity and faith has gained the respect and admiration not only of the Silliman Community but the entire province. She died at the ripe old age of 81 years old – accomplished and successful both spiritually and financially.   <br><br>Inside the Udarbe Memory Chapel, right beside the Main sanctuary were the remains of  a 3rd year college female student who took her own life in the very early hours of Jan. 17.  Her lifeless body was found under the staircase of her dormitory off-campus.  She hanged herself with her own blanket, apparently because of some very personal emotional problems she could not handle. <br><br>The SU Church pastors were tasked to lead in both necrological services that evening , one after each other.  The atmosphere in those two services were strikingly different. One was full of peace, joy, thanksgiving and celebration. The other one was shocking, sad, and simply heart-breaking. One life was lived to its fullest. One life was snatched so suddenly and unexpectedly.  But in both situations, there is much to reflect on.  <br><br>One is the ever- important reminder of the Lord that our earthly life is but a breath.  The inevitability of death is a constant reminder to us all that we are not invincible.  We are not immortal. We are here today, but only until God allows. <br><br>The inevitability of death was the overarching reality prevailing in Apostle Paul’s heart when he wrote 2 Timothy.  After many years of advancing the Gospel that was entrusted to him by the Lord, he was slowly shifting his eyes to the inevitability of his death.  <br><br>Certainly, there was no fear of death in Paul.  He was certain of his destination after his earthly life.  He was looking forward to his eternal crown.  But what truly confronted Paul was the need to secure the Gospel of Jesus -- to make sure that the work of advancing it is passed on, and carefully entrusted to people who would be as committed and steadfast as he was.  <br><br>Paul wrote 2 Timothy while he was incarcerated during the time of Emperor Nero, a very brutal man whose hatred for the followers of Jesus was intense. Paul was concerned about the welfare of the churches during the time of persecution. He was concerned about the followers of Jesus who would not be able to stand the political and spiritual pressure of being a Christian and simply turn away from the truth.<br>  <br>Being the anointed prophet that he was, Paul was seeing through his spiritual eyes that the coming days would require the greatest of strength and faithfulness on the part of Christ’s followers.  <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Deception</span><br></div><br><br>        In the book <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Can Man Live without God?</span>  by Ravi Zacharias, he wrote that in 1960, 65 percent of the  Americans believe the Bible to be true.  <br><br>Some 35 years later, it dropped to 35 percent.  Of that percentage who believed in the Bible, 70 percent were not fully convinced there are moral absolutes.  <br><br>Christian author and educator Harold Sala, commenting on this, said, “Within barely a generation, we have moved from a position of clearly defined moral truths to one of moral relativism and uncertainty.”   <br>  <br>Many believe that the greatest casualties of this very ambiguous state of morality in the world today are no less than the children and the youth.  They are living in the midst of a world that is confused, a world that cannot draw hard and clear lines between what is wrong and what is right, a world that refuses to call sin, sin and truth, truth, a world that  continues to deny the absolute reign of God and His Word.   <br><br>This is the passion burning in Paul’s heart, “Preach the Word. Proclaim it. Live it. Defend it. Secure it. As prophesied by Paul, the time of deception has truly come.  Even very sincere church-going Christian feel inadequate to share the Word of God and defend clearly its positions on basic issues of salvation and morality. <br><br>It is very evident that we are living in a world that refuses to respect and accept the reality of an absolute truth.  <br><br>Instead, to suit a misguided sense of inclusivism and a distorted view of freedom, the world has upheld self-serving rules and human philosophies that have led us all farther and farther away from the Lord.   <br><br>A professor in classical studies in Wellesley College commented, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“The notion that there are many truths might seem to be well suited to a diverse society.  But when everyone is free to define truth, the result is an intellectual and moral shouting match in which the people with the loudest voices are most likely to be heard.” </span><br><br>All of us are caught in the middle of this confusing shouting match. In almost all facets of human life and society, we hear contradicting voices.  We are caught between conflicting opinions that require us to choose and decide. But in the end, can we truly draw the line? Can we make those hard choices without being arrogant, judgmental and haughty but in the spirit of genuine compassion, truth and justice?<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Discipleship</span><br></div><br><br>        The word disciple comes from  the Greek work “mathetes” and it means learner or student.  Jesus summarizes the concept of discipleship when he said, “Come follow me.”  <br><br>Now, more than ever before, the Lord is calling us to learn from him. God is inviting us to grow in godly wisdom and maturity.  Through the witness of Scriptures, God is opening doors for people to discover and experience the incomparable joy and genuine security that only Jesus Christ offers and is able to provide.  <br><br>Through his Word, God is helping us understand there is more to life than acquiring wealth, gaining achievements, or pursuing our dreams and ambitions.   <br><br>When all is said and done, when we are down to our very last breath, it is only the beautiful face of Jesus that will truly matter. May it be the greatest joy of our hearts to love him, to serve him, to follow him, and to give him glory through all that we are and will ever be.  <br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>If ever you do FourSquare, you will quickly find that as of this writing, I am the “mayor” of KRI, a new fusion restaurant along Silliman Avenue that’s creating much talk among culinary adventurers in Dumaguete. There’s a reason for that, and there’s a reason I’m the so-called mayor of it.<br><br>FourSquare, of course, is this popular iPhone and iPad app that locates and tags you in places you are currently in—but beyond it being a geography-specific tool for Internet-driven vanity, it is increasingly becoming a helpful tool to locate online, while you are in a particular locality, the best places to go to for various things. Like food.<br><br>For the uninitiated, the app works by asking its users to “check in” every time they are in a specific establishment—and if they want, to leave a few helpful tips about the place. (On KRI’s FourSquare profile, I’ve left this tip: “Try everything, but begin with the fish dish.”) <br><br>When one has checked in a particular place enough times, one becomes its “mayor”. I know it’s all so silly—but it’s a platform in this app-devouring time that I can’t ignore, if I am to remain an updated observer of popular culture that is. <br><br>It goes without saying that I’ve checked in so many times at KRI that I’ve eventually become its mayor. (Sorry, Ritchie Armogenia.) <br><br>Why the constant patronage? Simple: I have yet to find a smidgen of disappointment in this restaurant. It’s cheap, it’s near the heart of downtown—and the food is downright delicious.<br><br>Ritchie, of course, is its chef and visionary. Many months ago, after studying culinary arts at the Colorado Institute of Arts, and after stints in Brown Palace Hotel in Denver and the Peninsula Hotel in Chicago (he also trained briefly under Chef Thanawat Bates in 2008 as part of the James Beard Foundation in New York), he returned to his hometown to make his mark in local cuisine. <br><br>We have seen his first efforts in Likha, his tapas bar in South Seas Resort. Together with his cousin Kris Zubiri, his sister Kit, his father Rene, and his wife Iris, he launched KRI a few months ago—and judging from its reception, it has become an instant success. <br><br>The restaurant’s name is really an acronym sporting the first letters of all their given names, “but if you Google ‘kri,’ it gives you <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">kri-kri</span>, a Greek goat subspecies. So I think we’ve covered all of them,” Ritchie tells me. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Is there a goat dish in the menu?</span> I ask. He answers: “Soon. Who knows we might come up with goat dish someday.”<br><br>What KRI offers is more of the fusion cuisine that Ritchie has become known for, always working with local ingredients but adding a twist to it. “Really, one can do a lot of things with a tomato,” Ritchie says. “And we want to be as creative as we can get with what we have locally. “It is the same with Likha. That one is more on the tapas and tasting menus, smaller portions for those who just want to hang, have a drink, although guests can certainly indulge.” <br><br>But KRI, he says, is designed more for his own version of “comfort food” cooking, with the healthier option of having to do without grease, and with no masking of flavors. “There is no magic <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sarap</span> here,” he laughs. “We hope to do honest cooking. We can’t just open cans. Our sauces we make from scratch.”<br><br>There is also the surprise in terms of his prices, something that piqued interest right from the very beginning: nothing on the menu is priced above P99—which should be good news for notoriously cheap and very discriminating Dumagueteños. <br><br>“The goal,” Ritchie says, “was to make good food available and affordable to everyone, especially the student market here in Dumaguete. Healthy options need not put a burden in our budgets, and we have all been there, being students eating on a budget. We, however, hope to expand soon, and maybe we can also offer a different menu for those willing to pay more for a semi-fine dining experience. There have been requests for that already.”<br><br>Looking back, I remember making a promise to myself that I had to try KRI the moment I got back from the U.S. because it was all everybody was Twittering and Facebooking about. My first dish was the Negrense Fried Rice, because it promised so much of local flavor—and it was all that I could do to fill my palate with to erase the memory of American food. <br><br>What I got was comfort food fried rice with tiny bits of carrot, plus some scallions and chorizo, topped with pork belly, and then a sunny-side-up egg. It had a texture I found tender and enticing, the taste of the pork somehow lent a surprising softness by the yolky juice that soon covers the dish.<br><br>Soon, there were other favorites in my quest to try everything on the menu: the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sambal</span> chicken with stir-fried vegetables and later on, the herb-crusted chicken breast with lemon caper beurre blanc, the spicy shrimp (sautéed with chili, garlic, and tomatoes) and the marinated tofu, and the oven-braised pork baby back ribs with San Miguel Beer barbecue sauce. I topped most of that, always, with a ginger lemonade, KRI’s specialty drink which has a delicious spicy kick to it. <br><br>And then there is the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pad thai</span>—perhaps the best one can find in the City—and the KRI burger with Swiss cheese, and the turkey on ciabatta and the barbecued pulled pork. <br><br>Once I had its Chocolate of the Week—a concoction so sinful I swore never to have it again, or at least have it with an intense sense of moderation. <br><br>But always, I turn to a dish that has become a favorite: its Fish of the Week. So far, the revolving recipes for that dish include sautéed tuna with shrimp and chili butter sauce, and later, pan-seared tuna bundled with vegetable rice paper rolls and strips of ham. <br><br>Those dishes have some sacred succulence marinated in every quick bite, both of them tempting fares that fill us and seduce the tongue without overwhelming it with unnecessary kick.<br><br>Of course, I had to return more than once. And that is why I am the mayor of KRI.<br><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Mayorofkri.jpg\"><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR>With the passing of our beloved Gov. Tuting Perdices early this month, I would like to pay my respects to his family, friends, relatives, people who worked for him, and to the public at large in this time of sorrow. <BR><BR>It was obvious from the people who spoke during his funeral that he was a well-respected and beloved leader, even back when he was still a mayor of this gentle City.  His passing reminds us how fragile life is.  <BR><BR>Lately, there have been other reported deaths from various causes, of people of different ages and backgrounds. <BR><BR>The death of someone close to us is always a difficult process to go through. The people left behind have to grieve for an unspecified time - some only for a short time, others for months and months or even years, depending on how close they were to the departed.<BR><BR>When I was a student at New York University for my Masters degree in clinical social work, I was assigned to work with cancer patients.  It was a very intense assignment: my work involved counseling the dying and their families, and I also had to deal with staff who had seen death day in and day out at the cancer unit.  <BR><BR>Although most of the patients were strangers to me, it was very difficult to cope with witnessing the ends of their lives.  <BR><BR>It is impossible to prepare oneself for the loss, impossible to understand the sorrows that we experience when it happens, and pointless to try to find logic in the situation.  <BR><BR>In the case of those who suffer from long-term illnesses, often there is an expectation that death is imminent, but yet when it happens we weep and wail just the same. Death is never subtle, nor calm.  It creates chaos and unsettledness.  It sends a shockwave through our nerves. <BR><BR>Frankly, none of us is prepared to face death, whether that of our loved ones, people who are close to us, or especially oursleves. <BR><BR>The irony of death is that it is absolutely certain, but few of us are prepared for it.  Its only redeeming quality is that hopefully it puts an end to the suffering of the departed one.<BR><BR>Based on my experience, grief for the loss of someone we love has no time limit.  It is very hard to tell someone that it is time to move on from their grief; it’s inappropriate and unthoughtful. <BR><BR>The grieving process is personal, and we all grieve in various ways.  There is no right or wrong way to grieve, as long as we don’t harm ourselves or others.  <BR><BR>Often, there are no words or deeds that can comfort the survivors, and sometimes they don’t wish to be comforted. In time, we heal and to find our bearings again, and when we do, there is a sense of relief, that our emotional suffering was worth going through, because it took its natural course.<BR><BR>Grief will pass, or will become part of us. Enduring the passing of loved ones can be a source of strength and will, an encouragement to live our lives to the fullest, so that people will remember us fondly when we ourselves pass on to whatever comes next.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

This was the first thought that came to my mind when I read the two bills on sports in the Philippine Senate website.<br><br>Incidentally, if you have the time and want to be entertained with something akin to what could be a candidate for inclusion in the Guinness World Record, try perusing the list of the thousands of proposed bills filed by our senators of the 16th Congress. It’s like a contest among the 24 senators on who could file the greatest number of bills. One wonders what method they use to choose which among the bills filed they should attend to.<br><br>Anyway, Sen. Edgardo J. Angara filed SB no. 48, titled An Act Creating the Philippines Sports University and for Other Purposes.<br><br> And Sen. Pia Cayetano, on her part, filed SB no. 2620 (yes, folks, that’s the 2620th bill filled according to the list in the Senate website), titled An Act Creating and Establishing the Philippine High School for Sports.<br><br>Gee whiz, a sports university and a sports high school in our beloved Philippines?  <br><br>As the founding dean of the UP Institute of Sports, PE & Recreation (SPEAR) more than 35 years ago, and giving rise to what is now the UP College of Human Kinetics—an entity in the UP Diliman campus which has become a symbol of neglect, incompetence, and lack of vision of the administrators of the State University -- I couldn’t help but be literally ROTF LOL (rolling on the floor laughing out load).<br><br>So I dashed to my iPad, and emailed the following to the good senators and authors of the proposed bills:<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dear Senator Angara and Madame Senator Cayetano. Permit me please to comment on the two sports bills which you have filled, one pertaining to the creation of a sports university and another on the establishment of a sports high school.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">1. Except for China, there is no model for the establishment of a university of sports in Asia, much more in ASEAN countries. Not even progressive states in our area like Singapore, Hong Kong, or Australia and New Zealand have a sports university.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">2. We have failed to invest in the professional training of the manpower we need to man our national sports development program. A perfect example of this failing is the UP College of Human Kinetics. In its over 35-years of existence, it has not produced a single PhD in sports management, sports medicine, and sports science. Currently, its faculty does not have any doctorate degree holder who can be considered an expert in any of the various disciplines of sports and who had received or have been exposed to training abroad. The UP CHK is a perfect symbol of our failure in investing in the human resource manpower in the multi-disciplinary field of physical education and sports.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">3.To my mind, what the government should do is to follow the example of Thailand which had put in place a practice more than three decades ago, and which we could emulate. They have PE and sports colleges that were treated as normal institutions for teachers’ training in its 75 provinces, grouped into six regions. These colleges produce the PE and sports teachers who are behind the current supremacy of Thailand in the SEA Games.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">4. In the Philippines, there are similar existing colleges attached to higher education institutions that the government, through legislation, can upgrade and strengthen. This will mean prescribing curricular offerings and most of all, encouraging graduate studies in PE, sports management, and sports science. An example of such an entity is the Institute of Youth Sports for Peace of Foundation University in Dumaguete City which is pioneering, through the College of Education, in offering graduate courses in sports management, wellness, and sports events management. There are also similar colleges in Cebu that offer specialized courses in sports, for which the government could extend support.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">5. With regards to the Philippine High School for Sports, a similar obstacle is encountered in the paucity of qualified staff to man the program. With some 100 million Filipinos, one can literally count with one’s fingers the number of Filipinos with professional degrees who could qualify for employment in the PHSS.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">6. Please note further that there were two instances by the Philippine Sports Commission to establish a Philippine Sports Institute. First was attempted by former Chair Dr. Philip Ella Juico during the term of President Fidel Ramos. The attempt failed. The second attempt was made by then Chair William “Butch” Ramirez two years ago. Likewise, it was a failure and was not supported by his successor.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Thus, if these small attempts at inaugurating an educational entity for sports did not gain ground, what hope is there for a university of sports to exist in our midst?</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">May I reiterate my recommendation: for government to support existing colleges of PE and Sports attached to HIEs in ensuring that the mass-based education of PE and sports professionals be conducted according to standards that will make us competitive in international sports. It is sad to note that outstanding athletes like Lydia de Vega-Mercado, who finished a Bachelor of Physical Education, is now employed in Singapore instead of say, Far Eastern University where she studied for 12 long years to obtain her degree while in the service of the country and winning honors.  And now, her training and experience are being used not for the benefit of her countrymen but by a neighboring City State.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">This is sad, very sad, indeed.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">In short, your honors, we, sad to say, are not ready to implement the vision and mission envisioned in Senate Bills Nos. 48 and 2620.</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

And it was at school that I found this girl, waiting for a class to begin. She was dangerously balanced on the wall above an open air shaft, listening to music. <BR><BR>I was there to shoot classroom pictures, students reading, asking questions; the teacher standing at the whiteboard: standard stuff. Walking down the hall, I saw the girl sitting there, and grabbed a passing shot of her without thinking about it much. <BR><BR>Photography is part of  my job at Foundation University. I’m terrible at fashion pictures, or weddings, but fortunately that’s not required of me; I’m only need to be good at shooting and editing everyday situations, and that’s what I do.<BR><BR>Most of this work is routine, even dull. Classroom shots, conferences, speeches, formal dinners, awarding ceremonies. You need a reasonably good eye, and a certain amount of technical skill to do this well, but there’s no glamour in it, and no art. Most of the time, a photographer is just a skilled artisan following a trade, like a plumber or a carpenter. <BR><BR>But there are exceptions. Once in a while you can produce pictures of great beauty, pictures that reflect the world around you in a deep and powerful way. Sometimes this happens and you know it at the time you shoot it; more often it happens unconsciously, almost by accident; you don’t know it until you see it later. <BR><BR>A great idea, a great melody, a great photograph: these things come to those who receive them out of nowhere; they are like mysterious gifts from gods or  angels. You can’t expect them and you don’t deserve them; you can only recognize them when they come and be thankful for them. Great work is not something you do; it’s something you accept. And you can’t take much credit for it.<BR><BR>Like this picture. I had even forgotten taking it! I was as surprised as anyone when I saw how good it was. When I saw what I had, of course I took some trouble to make it look as good as possible. <BR><BR>And now, when I say that it’s beautiful and mysterious- like life itself- I’m not bragging about me.

One was reported at the Hall of Justice last Wednesday, and another one was reported at the Colegio de Sta. Catalina de Alejandria (COSCA) last Thursday. Interestingly, there was also a widely-circulated hoax text message last Wednesday that a passenger plane from Dumaguete had crashed while enroute to Manila.<BR><BR>There are pranksters and there are pranksters. And there are limits as to what prank to pull, and what not to pull. To make bomb threats is already going beyond the boundary of healthy and clean fun. The comical series seen on TV involving hidden cameras and subjecting people to absurd situations may be okay because no one is injured and the victims are immediately informed that this was merely a hidden-camera trick.<BR><BR>But in a bomb threat, people could be hurt in resulting panic to get out of the building. Also, there is no way for the victims to tell if the threat was indeed a joke or if it was real. They just have to wait and wait for the bomb disposal squad to give the all-clear signal.<BR><BR>These threats easily spread by text messaging because anyone can buy a sim card and send out any kind of message. There should be a law requiring the registration of sim cards. This is not difficult to do. Cellphone companies can simply de-activate unregistered cards.<BR><BR>The frequency of these bomb threats indicate that the perpetrators have no fear of being found out. <BR><BR>Interestingly, this complements an observation made by the Traffic Management Office in Dumaguete that we now have more unruly drivers in our streets.

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>The Cebu community newspaper, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Freeman</span> (Jan. 13, 2011) included a report on a proposed massive reclamation in Panglao Bay, Bohol by a private firm.  The newspaper report said that about 300 fishermen and residents of three villages were pushing for government approval of the proposed project. The report also stated that the project proponents had assured the group of “alternative livelihood and biodiversity enhancement.”<br><br>I am writing this column based on above-mentioned newspaper report, supplemented by information from other sources. <br><br>I would like the Boholanos to consider carefully this proposed project because reclamation has some dire consequences in the immediate and long-term future. <br><br>While the promise of more sources of livelihood may appear dazzling, yet there is some uncertainty connected with the project. <br><br>One is the negative impact of climate change, particularly the extreme weather elements, that threatens all islands and archipelagos of the world, including Panglao Island. <br> <br>This is the reason why it is always necessary to consider the Precautionary Principle when we attempt to tinker with nature, especially in small islets and islands because we know far less than what we think we now know.<br><br>Panglao and Bohol Island came into their present form as a result of millions of years of natural processes resulting in their present stable status. <br><br>These two islands, despite their proximity to Cebu Island, are very different from the latter. Take for example, Bohol’s biodiversity (including marine and terrestrial species), which is so different from that of Cebu. <br><br>This is the reason Bohol is so unique. This uniqueness explains why Bohol has emerged as favorite destination for ecotourism, which is already providing a large source of income for the Boholanos. There is, therefore, good reason to preserve this uniqueness.<br><br>Any attempt to alter the stable, natural conditions, which required millions of years to build, is bound to cause disruptions in the natural functioning of ecosystems. <br><br>For example, by creating islands in the bay, a lot of changes in seawater flow and movement would occur. Such things as land erosion, sedimentation, altered direction of ocean currents will occur that would negatively affect ocean productivity (as measured by such indicators as plankton, fisheries yield, primary productivity, etc.). <br><br>We have seen all these happening in the country, indicating that our islands are very susceptible to extreme weather conditions. <br><br>And this is the view of those studying the vulnerability of the Philippines to climate change.  During the past few years, destruction of coastal areas on Bantayan Island, Negros Island, Apo Island, etc. is a preview of what might happen in the future. <br><br>Artificial islands are unstable geologically, and buildings constructed on such unstable substrates could topple over with the combined effects of sea level rise, and stormy weather already occurring in the country. <br><br>It is a folly to even think of creating coral reefs in artificial island passages because corals require a pristine environment and thousands of years to grow and develop their natural assemblages of marine species. <br><br>Those who think people can do better than nature are in for a surprise. Thus, massive reclamation can become a prelude to massive destruction of the natural resources of Panglao Island. <br><br>I suggest that government and Boholanos think deeply, availing themselves of the best information provided by the sciences of marine biology, oceanography, fisheries, and geology as guide to development.  <br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Born from crises, after long periods of passive tolerance or neglect, (bans) tend to deal with immediate problems…(But) bans alone are insufficient…to correct underlying problems of misuse”. <br><br>The 2001 report is anchored to case studies of six countries: New Zealand, China, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam. Floods to loss of whole forest ecosystems rachet pressure in Asia and the Pacific for “swift and major changes”. <br><br>To work, bans require complementary reforms and firm hands that  fits today’s demand by SSN.<br>    <br>One of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Forest Out of Bounds</span> authors is forester Patrick  Durst  of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. He e-mailed: “When I was in Manila in December, Department of  Environment people were actually optimistic about the passage of  a needed Sustainable Forest Environmental Management Bill.  <br><br>“Today, there is  so little commercial, industrial logging in the Philippines. It would be a big mistake for the country to totally ban logging. On the contrary, the country needs to make it far easier for small farmers to grow and harvest timber and make money from tree growing. <br><br>“Without the prospect of making money, there are no incentives for small farmers (or larger corporate investors) to give any priority to forests. Indeed, remove the value of forests to those in a position to “manage” them (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de facto</span> or <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">de jure</span>), and you are signing the death certificate for the forests.  <br><br>Structures of bans  vary.  Thailand and Sri Lanka clamped total logging bans on natural forests (Here, Juan Ponce Enrile’s firm, San Jose Timber, logs the Philippines last remaining natural forest in Samar).  China’s ban applied only to natural forests in specified regions, like upper reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers.  <br><br>Vietnam applied a mix of bans: In critical watersheds, a 30-year ban  ban was clamped on.  New  Zealand  transferred extensive tracts  to protected areas. This  constituted a  de-facto ban.<br>  <br>New  Zealand offers four  striking lessons: 1) It was a gradual  policy transition over decades; 2) Government foresaw a decline in natural forest production;3) Alternative timber supplies were provided for by establishment of  plantations; 4)Government structures were reshaped to  handle anticipated forestry patterns down the road. <br><br>Thus, Wellington privatized state-owned plantations.  Simultanouesly, it withdrew from commercial timber production. It also set up a separate national Department of Conservation. That drafted  legislation like protection of indigenous forests.<br><br>“We are saved by making the future present to ourselves,” the old saying goes. We can argue  endlessly, for example, on  why we didn’t display  foresight that  New Zealanders did. They began establishing plantations forests in  1920. “When large tracts of  natural forests were transferred to protected areas,  New  Zealand  was already harvesting  vast majority of it’s wood from plantations.”<br><br>Here,  did  greed to  make a quick buck from logging  blind Filipino policy making? We don’t have much forests left . That is clear.  What many overlook is we also have little of the  time needed to get alternative wood sources. Population almost quintupled, meanwhile, since 1940. <br><br>“Plantations in Thailand and the Philippines have not developed as planned…Plantations provide only  minor source of wood supplies in the Philippines. A prima donna  of  world timber exporters in the 1970s, this country is now a wood pauper.<br><br>“Logging bans are inherently neither good nor bad” as conservation and protection policy instruments, concludes <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Forest Out of Bounds</span>.  “They are simply one set of tools available within a spectrum of options…If adapted selectively and used with other policy instruments, they can ensure continued  well being of  people.”<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>ZURICH, SWITZERLAND -- One serious concern in relation to the current upheavals in the Middle East, apart from the likelihood of worsening instability in the region or global economic repercussions, has to do with impacts on the status of women.    <BR><BR>In such countries as Iran, Iraq, and also Afghanistan, it was noted that women’s rights took a serious downturn after political battles brought about regime changes. <BR> <BR>In many instances, not only were rights curtailed,  harsh systems of  oppression of women were put in place that persist to this day.  <BR><BR>Many may tend to ascribe such treatment of women to cultural and religious biases,  and specifically to Islam,  or at the very least to social backwardness,  since presumably, women fare better in modern Christian countries or in advanced economies.  <BR><BR>It is conveniently forgotten for example, that women are lower status persons in the Catholic Church that denies them the right to be priests.<BR><BR>The fact is,  women’s rights and status were and remain areas of struggle everywhere.  <BR><BR>I’m here in Switzerland at the moment, among the Top 6 or 7 richest, most well-governed countries in the world, and am reminded that as late as 1966 when I first came,  a firm patriarchal system was in place that refused women the right to vote!  <BR><BR>Women’s campaigns for suffrage had started as early as 1886 but in this direct democracy,  referendums, among men, of course, repeatedly said no to women’s suffrage.  <BR><BR>In 1966, one canton or state allowed women to vote on local matters.  But it wasn’t until 1971 that women finally obtained the right to vote in local and national (federal) elections, and even then, only 66 percent of voters approved this right (a good percentage remained opposed.)  <BR><BR>And by the way, two cantons at the time refused to conform to the decision. <BR>  <BR>The first woman federal councilor was elected in 1984, and it wasn’t until 2004 that a law gave women paid maternity leave.  <BR><BR>Why, that all seems like just yesterday, doesn’t it,  that women got their due?  <BR><BR>Today, only a fourth of elected politicians are women, and there is still a pay gap of about 26 percent even for women with university degrees and in higher managerial positions.  <BR><BR>Women are trafficked into this country for prostitution since there is a market of men who believe in their right to buy the use of women’s bodies,  and domestic violence happens here as it does elsewhere. <BR><BR>Even in advanced countries, therefore, women’s rights and equal status are not automatically assured.  <BR><BR>Just last month, a new United Nations structure started its work, the UN Entity for Gender Equality & the Empowerment of Women (UN Women  for short), headed by former president of Chile,  Michelle Bachelet. Top of its list of focus areas is violence against women, one of the most telling signs of gender inequality. <BR> <BR>UN Women and everyone concerned about women’s rights must pay attention to the events now unfolding in Egypt, Tunisia, and other countries in the region so that in future political arrangements,  women’s rights and status are protected.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

The common saying goes, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Makonsyensya naman sila!</span><br><br>The live coverage of the Senate hearings catalogue the hundreds of millions of pesos and dollars, diverted from one account to another, labelled  as “sluch fund” , for the personal use of the Generals, as if it was their  exclusive right to do. <br><br>They used their brains alright, and thus,  the documented corruption is staggering and shocking to  the conscience of man.<br><br>While the Generals wallow  from the  benefits  of their perfidy, the common soldier and his family struggle to meet their requirements of daily living, as well as their tools of the trade. <br><br>Watching the footages of the Marines killed by the Abu Sayaff, one cannot help but notice that all the soldiers were wearing worn-out flip- flops. They had no boots, and  they had no properly-functioning modern firearms. <br><br>Where did all the AFP Modernization funds go? Now we know for a fact what we suspected all along.<br><br>Senator Defensor- Santiago, as well as Sen.Antonio Trillanes, and Sen.  Chiz Escudero cannot be inhibited from participating in the  Senate legislative inquiry because  they are elected Senators of the Republic. <br><br>Under the doctrine of qualified political agency, they represent  the people when they conduct their inquiry.  It is as if it was you or me, or the man on the street asking the questions. That is the job of elected senators,  and they  should not shirk from their duty to conduct the investigation in aid of legislation. <br><br> <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“The power of inquiry – which process to enforce it -- is an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function. A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting conditions which the legislation intended to affect or change; and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information - which is not infrequently true-recourse must be had to other who do  possess it.”</span> (Arnault vs. Nazareno, 87 Phil.29);.<br><br>So the one-celled amoeba has a perfect defense. And we hope those people who have participated in the AFP fund mess can use their brains  for the power of discernment,  decide to change, and follow: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dito na tayo sa daan na matuwid</span>!<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>DAVAO CITY --  Hello. In case you’re wondering, yes, I’m still here.  If I haven’t been writing, it’s for the reasons I will soon enumerate.  <BR><BR>I’ve come to dislike personal revelations in spaces like this (that’s what my blog is for), but because I’ve been away for a while, I feel a brief recap is in order.<BR><BR>I started teaching full-time with Ateneo de Davao University last year.  While teaching pays less than what I used to earn working for a multinational, I get much more fulfillment out of the work.  <BR><BR>Young people make me feel and think young.  As far as dividends go, no consulting or sales job can match that. And while there are still administrative headaches to deal with, I have perspective now, and can see it for the silliness that it is.<BR><BR>I teach for both the Computer Studies Division and the Humanities Division. Computers or literature: I’ve given up trying to choose between one and the other.  I love them both.  <BR><BR>The subjects I teach -- operating systems, information security, and open source for IT, and creative nonfiction for English -- are all rich and leave plenty of room for experimentation.  I don’t feel like I’m wearing down a groove on endless repetition.  I have found that I am happiest when I am learning new things.<BR><BR>After several false starts and stops, I’ve returned to graduate studies.  I like it a little less than teaching.  It’s harder to follow someone else’s plan than your own, more so if you don’t agree with the track.  <BR><BR>But there it is, a necessary evil in higher academe. If it’s the price I have to pay to do what I love, well, so be it.<BR><BR>Learning has a price, though, and it can be painful.  Because I’ve delved deeper into literature in the course of teaching, I’ve learned that, well, I don’t really write as well as I think I did.  <BR><BR>I’m more a journeyman than an artist.  My prose is functional, but it doesn’t soar.  With time, this might change, but I am resigned to the idea that it might not, that I might remain at this level. I’m afraid that the self-criticism has taken its toll.  Ah, well.<BR><BR>Competence exacts a price as well.  It’s the reverse of the Peter Principle: you can be so good at what you do that it’s hard to move on to other things because people have come to depend on you.  <BR><BR>Such is the case with the work I’ve been doing for the Davao Writers Guild.<BR><BR>It’s not that I don’t like the work or the people I work with, because I do.  I like the idea that, even though I don’t write as well as I would like to, I’m moving the state of local literature forward, even if only in small inches.  <BR><BR>But my technical competence means that I end up doing a lot of the drudge work.  Let’s see: I run the web sites, I organize the annual workshop, I co-edit the weekly journal, and so far, I’ve put out three books and am in the process of turning out another two.  <BR><BR>And because Davao is the host for this year’s Taboan International Writers Festival, I’ve spent the past two months arranging the conference program, purchasing tickets, negotiating with printers, and managing other writers’ expectations.  <BR><BR>Don’t talk to me about delegation: I tried.<BR><BR>You know what they say about writers being difficult to work with? Well, it’s true. They’re absent-minded, they take their own time, and they don’t really listen to you.  It really is like herding cats.  <BR><BR>But I’m happy to say that the stereotype is more the exception than the rule, and if I’ve had any difficulty, it’s come from a minority, and it’s never really been out of malice.  Respond firmly and succinctly, show no fear, and snigger in private.  Heh.<BR><BR>But it rankles a bit. I ask myself why I am fixing and promoting someone else’s works instead of improving my craft.  <BR><BR>It can’t be because of the pay, which is peanuts.  Maybe because I can?  Maybe because no one else will? Maybe because I’m thinking of lamps and how they should not be covered? Maybe because I really am just such a nice guy?  I don’t know.<BR><BR>Yet, it does pay in other ways, just not in what I expected.  For instance, the  year before last, I marshalled two books to publication -- by that, I mean editing, laying out, bringing to the printer, and following up payment from the NCCA.  <BR><BR>It wasn’t easy: the author was sweet but technologically Jurassic, her work improperly formatted or available only in hard copy. In script form, too, which is a pain to work with.  <BR><BR>But get the books out I did, and what a sweet thing it was to look back on the experience.  Yatta!  I did it!<BR><BR>It also turned out that the author had a niece.  Though the niece and I didn’t quite hit it off the first time, we eventually got together.  We’re getting married this May.  But that’s a story for another time.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Adults should help children learn about their rights, too.” These important lines, which could be part of  the responsibility of all parents and adults, are also the goal of the Bright Lights Community Learning Centers in barangay Siit and Bonbonon here in Siaton. Making children  aware of their rights in a suitable and simple way – that’s what we did the past two Saturdays.<br><br>The students aged five to 15 years learned about this important topic, some of which include:<br><br>Art. 12/13 -- Freedom of expression. People should respect children’s ideas and opinions.<br><br>Art. 19 -- Parents (or other responsible persons) should ensure a protective environment for children, without any form of violence.<br><br>Art. 24 -- Children should have access to the best health care possible.<br><br>Art. 28 -- Every child has the right to education -- which should be free.<br><br>Art. 31 -- Children have the right to play.<br><br>Art. 32 -- Child labour is not allowed, especially when it harms  the children’s health or disrupts their education.<br><br>These rights were introduced and discussed with the children at Bright Lights by showing them short but impressive video clips, uploaded on the Internet by the children’s rights organization Unicef. <br><br>After the discussion, the students worked in groups to visualize their new knowledge, and design posters that represented their rights. <br><br>Such lessons required skills in combining the newly-acquired knowledge with creativity and arts -- which was a good preparation exercise for their participation in a collaborative painting competition organized by the Oriental Negros Children’s Advocacy Network, and slated for Feb. 26 at Robinson’s Place.<br><br>The Bright Lights Learning Centers also work to comply with other mandates in the Convention like:<br><br>Art. 17 -- Access to information; mass media. Children have the right to get information that is important to their health and well-being... Children should also have access to children’s books.<br><br>Art. 29 -- Goals of education. Children’s education should develop each child’s personality, talents, and abilities to the fullest. It should encourage children to respect other’s human rights and their own, and other cultures. It should also help them learn to live peacefully, protect the environment, and respect other people. Children have a particular responsibility to respect the rights of their parents, and that education should aim to develop respect for the values and culture of their parents.<br><br>Art. 31 -- Leisure, play and culture. Children have the right to relax and play, and to join in a wide range of cultural, artistic, and other recreational activities.<br><br>Knowledge about one’s own rights hopefully improves the child’s self-confidence, shows them that other people are concerned about their well-being, and makes them realize deficits in their own life.  <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Lilith Kugler</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">German Development Service</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Siaton, Negros Oriental</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Table tennis was popular in England in the second half of the 19th century under various trade names such as gossima and whiff-whaff. After  the  name ping-pong  was introduced by J.

Playing table tennis can be great way to get in shape while learning some valuable skills, developing stronger hand-eye coordination, and having lots of fun at the same time.<br><br>Table tennis has become such a popular exercise that table tennis tables are springing up in homes throughout the UK.<br><br>A boxer with slow reflexes would not be a very successful boxer.

Athletes from across the sports universe have been introduced to table tennis as a tool that can be used to help them stay at the top of their own game, whatever that may be.<br><br>Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson enjoy competing against one another on the golf course, and over the table tennis table. To them, table tennis is a source of relaxation and social interaction. They may or may not realize the value of the game they enjoy as a hobby. Golf requires extreme concentration, so does table tennis. They are actually practicing several skills when they play table tennis. Not only are they reinforcing their ability to concentrate regardless of distraction or level of pressure, but table tennis also helps them to improve and maintain their hand-eye coordination skills, another important component of a successful golf game.  <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Darryl Pinero</span><br><a href=\"mailto:darryl_pinero@yahoo.com\">darryl_pinero@yahoo.com</a><br><br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><br><br></html><br><br>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>MARIA, SIQUIJOR -- The United States government is continuing to process claims of Filipino-American World War II veterans under the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Benefit Program.<BR><BR>US Embassy Charge D’ Affairs Leslie Basset told reporters here that the processing of documents started after the deadline for applications closed in February last year.<BR><BR>“We are just finishing the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Benefit Program,” Basset said, adding that funds will be released to qualified beneficiaries “as soon as they finish with all the applications.” She did not give a time frame.<BR><BR>Basset was here in Siquijor Friday to lead the US delegation in the funeral of slain US Army Sgt. Zainah Caye Creamer, a military dog handler who was killed by Afghanistan insurgents in Kandahar in an improvised bomb attack last January 12.<BR><BR>The honors given to Creamer, Basset said, is an honor that the military affords to people who have given their life in active duty.  “She is certainly a hero to our eyes and we’re very proud to be in the Philippines honoring an American hero just as our soldiers have fought together since World War II and shoulder to shoulder. This is another instance of our two countries sharing the same dreams with the same sacrifices to make those dreams real.”<BR><BR>A few months ago, the US Congress allocated additional money to make sure we have enough for every single veteran, Basset said, apparently  referring to the final version of the Supplemental Appropriations Act passed by the US Congress last July.  It includes a rider that provides $67 million in additional funding for the Filipino veterans’ lump sum claims. <BR><BR>Veterans Administration records show that more than 16,000 claims have been already been paid as of July 2010, amounting to $190 million. The VA only has $8 million left in the lump sum fund, with only 4,000 claims left to process.<BR><BR>Basset also announced that the US government has also opened a new clinic for the veterans last February 1st and a new office for the Veterans Administration “so that we can continue to offer high quality service to all the veterans living in the Philippines who are qualified for benefits.”  <BR><BR>The new outpatient clinic, with modern facilities and state-of-the-art laboratories, is accredited by the College of American Pathologists.<BR><BR>More than 250,000 Filipinos served alongside U.S. soldiers to defend the Philippines, which was then part of American territory, from the 1941 Japanese invasion. They formed the resistance during the subsequent Japanese occupation.<BR><BR>The U.S. military assured Filipinos they would be able to apply for U.S. citizenship and qualify for full U.S. veterans’ benefits if they served. But one year after Japan’s surrender, the Rescission Act of 1946 declared that Filipinos were not in active service for the U.S. military during the war.<BR><BR>This stripped Filipinos of their status as U.S. veterans and denied them the benefits they were promised.  On the other hand, those who could not be denied benefits outright did receive them but at the reduced rate of 50-cents for every dollar Americans received.<BR><BR>An American Congresswoman, meanwhile, has filed House Bill HR 210, also known as the Filipino Veterans Fairness Act of 2011. Saying there is no such thing as a half-citizen, Congresswoman Jackie Speier (D, San Francisco and San Mateo) said her Bill would effectively repeal the Rescission Act and give Filipino-American veterans and their widows full benefits.  This still has to be debated in Congress.<BR><BR>Reports from the US quoted Speier as saying that the bill is asking for nothing more and nothing less than what was promised to them, underscoring the fact that, among non-American nationals that fought beside the US in WWII, only Filipino veterans have been singled out for such discriminatory treatment. The bill would end 65 years of institutionalized discrimination.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

The locations of the “sightings” include Bais, Bacong, Manjuyod, Tanjay, Valencia, and other places known to be sources of terracotta or clay. <br><br>Led by the art historian Flaudette May Datuin, the team consists of Michael Teves, Danni Sollesta, Benji Ranada, Cristina Taniguchi, and Mark Valenzuela.<br><br>The animals include, among others, an extinct amoeba that turns into an angel, an earth-dwelling creature that smells rumors before everybody else does, a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">kutong lupa</span> endemic to the Philippines, a guardian who protects the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">babaylan</span>, and a worm that winks called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">kindat-kindat</span>. <br><br>Rendered in terracotta by the “excavators”, these animals will be on show starting Feb. 7 at Mariyah Gallery in Dumaguete. The show also features the photographs of Hersley Ven-Casero.<br><br>The expedition to track, sight, record, and exhibit <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Anonymous Animals</span> in the island of Negros Island was inspired by the work of Joan Fontcuberta and Pere Formiguera  and their book Fauna (1999, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arte y Proyektos Editoriales</span>, SL, Seville, Spain). The book catalogued newly-discovered zoological specimens culled from the documents, notes from the laboratory, personal keepsakes, letters, and volumes of painstakingly-kept journals of the eccentric scientist Peter Ameisenhaufen. <br><br>The Philippine team follows this path by embarking on a localized version of this voyage of discovery. By centering on <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Anonymous Animals</span>,  the project brings into the discussion local concerns on environment, spirituality, and social realities. <br><br>The focus on anonymous non-human and extraordinary creatures not only aims at imagining that which is still possible (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pace</span> the biologist Francois Jacob, quoted in the epigram via Fontcuberta and Formiguera); the project also hopes to contemporize an anonymous and earthy medium – the lowly terracotta – which bears the marks and potential for conceptual, inter-disciplinal, and collaborative confluences that could enable us to access, engage with, and understand a local-global moral world.<br><br>The project has several phases. For Phase 1, the “excavators” limited themselves to Negros Island, zeroing in on sources of terracotta, a medium abundant in the islands. This phase  culminates in an exhibit at the Mariyah Gallery, and will run for one to two months beginning Feb. 7.<br><br>The February 2011 exhibit launches and sets the stage for Phase 2, which widens the scope and territory to include the rest of the Visayan Islands, and the islands of Luzon and Mindanao.  <br><br>The excavations in selected sites will culminate in an exhibition and conference for the (cash-strapped and much-delayed) 3rd International Dumaguete Terracotta Triennial slated for the last quarter of 2012.  The conference is invitational, and the exhibition will feature a select group of excavators, who will be chosen from proponents who will respond to a Call for Proposals, which will be issued after the opening of Phase 1.

As I started putting my thoughts together Tuesday about climate change, the temperature was 42 degrees C.  <br><br>With the hot air engulfing the body uncomfortably,  a Filipina workmate Rowie A cried to his circle of friends on Facebook, “Send me to the Philippines.”  She is back here in Sydney after taking a vacation in Pampanga for a couple of weeks.   A friend invited her to try Jeddah for a change, where temperature 45 degrees C.  Even hotter in Dubai, echoed another FB friend.<br><br>DJ, the daughter of a family friend who grew up here in Sydney is now on a vacation in Dumaguete.  She posted a thread on FB for her parents. She is enjoying the cold weather just like it was in Sydney in her teen years.  <br><br>What a picture in contrast to my family experience.  Back in 1999, we took a Qantas flight from Manila to Sydney on light clothings but had to grab our jackets walking to the freezing cold of Sydney.  <br><br>Now my son Rex wants to buy an aircon unit. He cried, “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Mura man ta ug maluto</span>.” Arnie chirped in, “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Lupig pay Pilipinas</span>”, while a niece living in Mt. Druitt who went outside her house to escape from an oven-like atmosphere inside agitated, “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Haskang inita diri sa gawas mura ta ug mapaig</span>.”  <br><br>I was suck into the commotion of the moment as I turned green with envy when a Silliman buddy Oca E (via an FB chat) told me, “<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">It’s freezing cold here in Toronto</span>.”<br><br>A climate change in different time zones?  Apparently, by dint of an empirical evidence.  “Is it global warming and the continued degradation of our only environment that has nurtured and sustained us?” mused my DYSR mate “Charlie Brown”.  <br><br>Obviously, it is part of the answer to an inconvenient truth.  To go logical from empirical, we change channel.  We take a peek on Al Gore’s documentary, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">An Inconvenient Truth</span>.<br><br>According to Wikipedia, the documentary has been credited for raising the international public awareness on climate change, and re-energizing the environmental movement.  <br><br>Gore warns our wayward carbon footprints and climate change pose dangers -- the dilemma of being vise-gripped between a global warming or ice age.  <br><br>With carbon dioxide blanketing the Earth’s atmosphere, a greenhouse effect is created whereby solar heat is reflected back to the Earth’s surface with greater intensity by the dome-like structure of greenhouse gases. Almost similar to an oven-like space.  <br><br>The documentary argues that global warming can be reversed by releasing less CO2 and planting more vegetation to consume existing CO2. Gore concludes:  “Each one of us is a cause of global warming, but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we  buy, the electricity we use, the cars we drive...to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero.  The solutions are in our hands...the will to act is a renewable source.”<br><br>One clear and definite goal is to plant trees. Pursuing it may turn out to be a defining moment for the Oriental Negrenses. <br><br>This is an opportunity for the Gen X Governor to take the lead in a massive drive to grow trees on the Province’s bald-headed mountains.  <br><br>According to one website I surfed on the Internet, Negor’s forest cover is now down to five percent from 95 percent in 1918.  Although the accuracy may be debatable, nevertheless it presents a general picture of the worsening state of our forest cover which 10 years ago (when I was still in Dumaguete) was already down to the 10 percent level.  <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Gender Bender</span> columnist Cecilia Hofmann has a vivid poetic imagery.  She describes the remaining forests as mere dots of green in 1987 and 1998, compared to the sweep of green in 1875.  From 17 million hectares of forest cover in the early 1930’s down to 4.7 million hectares in 2010, she laments; even as she embraces the rebirth of the Liptong Woodlands in Valencia through the dreams of Rene Vendiola and Pol Carino.  <br><br>Viewed from here in Sydney via reading the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dumaguete MetroPost</span>, the Negor constituents are already well aware of of the environmental concerns.  For two years now, the Bio Mechanical Goat is ingesting organic waste materials to turn it into organic fertilizer.  <br><br>This is a joint project of the Manjuyod municipality and Foundation University as initiated by former Gov. Petit Baldado and FU President Mira Sinco.  <br><br>During its formal launching ceremony, which I happened to attend, the late Gov. Tuting Perdices planned to replicate the BMG in the barangays Province-wide, perchance as Petit envisioned to make Negor the Region 7 source of organic fertilizers.  <br><br>Learning centers are going green as well.  The Bright Lights Learning Center in Siaton is teaching school children early on issues that matter in life, such as climate change. <br> <br>Gore had interlaced his <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Inconvenient Truth</span> with a well- known anecdote about a boiling frog along with majestic photos of the planet Earth taken from the Apollo missions.  The anecdote tells of a frog gradually being boiled alive.  The scenario frames that if a frog is placed in a boiling water, it will jump out; but if it is placed in cold water that is slowly heated, it will not sense the danger and will just be cooked to death. He underscores, “It is important to rescue the frog.”<br><br>Bad moon rising! End of the World in 2012? If the physical threat and obliteration do not move us into action, then let me try the sublime persuasion with poets as environmentalists. <br><br>Let me present to you two poets, Joyce Kilmer and Smile Henry.  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Of Trees</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tree</span>. Both poets beheld the tree with a sense of wonder.  Kilmer mused, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“I think that I shall never see/A poem lovely as a tree...Poems are made by fools like me/But only God can make a tree.”</span>   Henry contemplated, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Majestic, tall, strong   Powerful, life giving, aged Food, seeds, hope...Am I a tree?...I want to be a tree.  Food, seeds, hope/A tree, I am a tree.</span>”<br><br>Unaware, we are in danger of being slowly boiled alive by global warming which may as ill derail planet Earth (Gaia) away from her orbital majesty.  <br><br>Save the frog, we must.  Plant trees, we must.  The frog is us.  The tree is us, especially when planted by the river for our roots to soak well into the Living Water.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Jesus’ mother was there, <sup>2</sup>and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. <sup>3</sup>When the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.” <sup>4</sup>“Woman,[a] why do you involve me?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet come.”  <sup>5</sup>His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” <sup>6</sup>Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons.  <sup>7</sup>Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water”; so they filled them to the brim. <sup>8</sup>Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.” John 2: 1-8</span><br><br>Marriage is not just a social contract or a formal agreement between a man and a woman to live together for life.  Marriage has a very powerful and holy purpose.  <br><br>In the Bible, God intended every marriage to be a reflection of his presence in the world today.  In short, it is God’s desire that every union of husband and wife become a showcase of his presence and glory.   <br><br>But the truth is, many marriages today are falling apart.  The pressures of modern life have made it extremely difficult for married people to stay faithful to their vows, and to commit themselves until death. <br><br>The reasons are complex and varied.  We are not here to judge.  We are here simply to realize that we need God’s help to make anything really succeed, including marriage.      <br><br>The first documented miracle of Jesus Christ happened in a wedding. It happened in Cana, a small town in Galilee where  Jesus turned water into wine when the couple’s family ran out of wine for their wedding guests.  <br><br>Similarly to the Filipino culture, weddings in the culture of Jesus were considered to be big social events. Weddings are also the best time to impress the members of community.  <br><br>In the Gospel account, however, the horror of horrors happened.  The families of the married couple ran out of wine to serve their guests. Mary, the mother of Jesus, instantly came to the rescue.  She then brought the problem to Jesus.  At first, Jesus did not want any involvement with the problem, but just the same, his heart of compassion rose to the occasion.   We are told that Jesus transformed six jar stones of water to wine, which, after serving the guests, impressed everyone.  <br><br>Like our Bible account today, there always comes a point in life when we run dry.  This dryness can manifest in many ways, and in various seasons of our lives -- when financial difficulties come;  when health problems strike;  when our relationships are threatened, or at times, when we are visited by feelings of extreme loneliness and weariness that we cannot even explain.  <br><br>It is refreshing to know that when those moments come, when spiritual dryness hits us hard, we can always turn to Jesus Christ for help. <br><br>It was not mere coincidence or circumstantial that the first miracle of Jesus happened in the context of a wedding.  God intended it that way.  God wants us to appreciate that marriage and miracles are perfect partners. It is in the context of marriage and family life that we can truly witness the power of Jesus at work.  <br><br>A miracle is defined as an event that cannot be explained by the laws of nature.  In short, miracles are acts of God.  These are events and circumstances in life that can only be attributed to the power, grace, and glory of the Lord. <br><br>God wants every marriage to succeed. And that is non-negotiable.  On the part of God, he will do everything in his power to help. But God also wants us to be responsible and accountable for that success. <br><br>For a marriage that is truly anchored in Christ,  there is no Plan B or Plan C, just in case in does not work.  Marriage is for life -- for better or for worse, until death separates one from the other.  <br><br>Husbands, know and remember that you vowed to love and commit yourself only to one woman until death separates you from her.  May God grant you integrity to stand by that sacred vow.  <br><br>Jesus wants you to love your wife the way He loved and cared for the Church -- even to the point of laying down your life for her sake.  Honor her with utmost love.  Protect her. Nurture her. Take good care of her needs. Understand her need for attention and appreciation even when she is most unlovable.   <br><br>The same goes to every wife.  God wants you to know that you vowed to love and commit yourself only to one man until death separates you from him.  It’s hard to stand by your man when the going gets tough -- but that’s what marriage is all about. <br> <br>I pray that by the grace of God, you wives will learn to be kind with your words, and generous with your encouragement.  Give your husband unconditional respect and trust -- most especially when the going gets really tough, and when it is most tempting to just give up and walk away.<br><br>Today, allow me now to speak words of blessings to all husbands and wives who continue to reach out to the Lord in full faith -- pleading for strength every single day to keep the marriage bed pure; upholding the promise to be faithful in sickness and in health, for richer and for poorer, until death!  <br><br>I speak to you three miracles:  1) The Miracle of Provision.   May you experience God’s abundant provisions -- material and most especially, spiritual as you seek his will; 2) The Miracle of Partnership.  May your love for each other bring glory to Jesus Christ and make a difference in the lives of many; and the 3) The Miracle of  Answered Prayers.

   "body": "<BR><BR>Valentines Day is in two weeks, and of course, gift stores all over town are gearing up for a big shopping spree for that special someone.  <BR><BR>My hope is that those who are looking forward to celebrating this special occasion may remember that to celebrate romantic love or the expression of love and affection is not something to do just once per year.  Rather, to express one’s love is an everyday or an any day act.  <BR><BR>Call me crazy, and perhaps unromantic, but in this day and age, do people actually still buy in to the whole cliche of Valentine’s Day?  <BR><BR>Valentines Day goes back 500 AD, established by Pope Gelasius, named after St. Valentines. It is traditionally associated with romantic love, and is a day of celebration to express love and affection. <BR><BR>Almost everyone on the planet celebrates this special day.  But it is also an excuse to spend unnecessary money for self indulgence. <BR><BR>I’m not saying that we should ignore those special moments that we want to share with our love ones, but the truth is, you can always celebrate that special moment any given time and day and in any form. <BR><BR>Now, let’s talk about relationships in general, not in the spirit of Valentines Day as celebrated only once a year, but in the spirit of emotional and spiritual relationships in our everyday lives. <BR><BR>For starters, a healthy relationship is good, fun, and comforting. It’s something that we all aspire for, because after all, it is part of our personal yearning for happiness. <BR><BR>However, for a relationship to be healthy does not mean that it is without any challenges, which allows learning to be part of the equation. <BR><BR>The truth is, there is no such thing as a perfect relationship -- every one has its ups and downs. The question is, how do we cope and deal with the ups and downs? <BR><BR>Often, it’s not easy, and at times, it’s exhausting. But challenges are necessary to make relationships better. We are humans after all, complicated and ever-changing.  <BR><BR>Whether you like it or not, we are flawed as part of our nature, which, in my opinion, makes life more interesting and exciting in a positive way.  As complicated relationships are, they’re well worth it. <BR><BR>Love comes in different ways and different forms. As cliche as it is, yes, we only live once, and that is all the more reason why we should venture into a healthy relationships.  It’s good for the soul, and it’s part of our humanity.  <BR><BR>However, not all relationships are for everyone -- some have tried and decided that it’s not for them, while others are unlucky and have given it up altogether. <BR><BR>But for those of us who enjoy both the romance and the challenges of relationships, it’s one of those things that we certainly can’t give up.  <BR><BR>After all, we are social beings, and as the saying goes “love conquers all,” so why not give it a chance?<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

When we met in university, we were both quite mindful of how we took care of our bodies, and it continued on until we became husband and wife. <br><br>A healthy and active outlook in life was probably one of the traits that got us attracted to each other to begin with. The ‘healthy lifestyle’ was even easier to do, and more enhanced when we decided to move to Dumaguete, and away from the stressful life in Manila. <br><br>We would say there are three major “push” factors that encourage us to live healthy and actively. <br><br>The first and probably the strongest influence is the health history of our families. Name it, our families have it – different cancers, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Multiple Systems Atrophy – and we have seen how these illnesses can really strain a person’s life and his family’s as well…physically, emotionally, and financially. <br> <br>Since we have no control over our genes, we realized that the best way to prevent, or at least lower, the risk of getting these diseases is by controlling our diet and lifestyle. <br><br>Actively choosing what we eat, and what we do daily is easier, more fun, and way cheaper than treating the disease once it’s there. Prevent rather than cure.<br><br>The second factor is our profession. As practicing biologists, we often find ourselves scrutinizing information about good and bad food, exercise, diseases, environmental hazards, pollutants, carcinogens, dangerous chemicals, etc. <br><br>With food alone, so much information is out there telling us what to eat and what not to eat to keep our bodies healthy. <br><br>On a positive note, the information makes people more aware and concerned about their health. <br><br>On the other hand, the information may sometimes conflict with each other, leaving people confused about what to do. To eat trans fats or not to eat trans fats? That is the question these days. But what are trans fats?<br><br>The third factor is the active lifestyle inculcated in us by our families during our childhood. <br><br>We were both brought up in an environment that nurtured a love for sports and the outdoors. Our parents and siblings were big in tennis, swimming, football, basketball, or golf. Trips to the beach, camping on islands, snorkeling, and hiking were common activities during vacations. <br><br>When we were younger, we tried anything from table tennis to taekwondo, from judo to fencing. <br><br>Later in our lives, we picked up mountain biking, scuba diving and yoga -- which we continue to this day. <br><br>Mixing sports and the outdoors was a normal part of our young lives, so it was easy for us to continue living like that even today. <br><br>Apart from making us healthier, the plus side to outdoor sports is that it makes us appreciate how beautiful the natural world is around us -- no iPhones or iPads necessary.<br><br>So what is a ‘healthy lifestyle’ for us and how do we actually live it? Healthy living for us is what’s natural and simple. We try our best to eat food that are as close to their natural state as possible – more fresh and home-cooked food, and less processed food products. <br><br>We practiced a pescetarian diet (seafood and vegetables only), which Rene jokingly refers to as “vegaquarian”,  for about eight years, but decided to put meat back into our meals when our daughter arrived, to allow her to get a fuller experience on food choices. <br><br>We believe that variety and moderation are the keys to maintaining a healthy diet. <br><br>Our exercise comes in different forms – biking, yoga, swimming, scuba diving, walking or running, taking our daughter to the beach or the local park. Anything that gets us out of the couch, away from the TV or computer, and moving all our limbs is considered exercise or activity. <br><br>Finally, healthy living for us also means using our resources wisely and efficiently. We try our best to buy only the things that we need, and not too much of what we want, to avoid having too much waste around us. Less consumption means less waste. <br><br>After all is said and done anyway, our life can only truly be healthy if the environment we live in is healthy as well.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Nadia Palomar-Abesamis is an assistant professor in biology at Silliman University; Rene is a researcher at the SU Angelo King Center for  Research & Environmental Management while completing his PhD in Marine Biology at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia.</span><br><br><img \"align=\"LEFT\"\" src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/scubadiving.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br>Nadia and Rene underwater in Dauin, Negros Oriental<br><br><br><img \"align=\"LEFT\"\" src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/mountainclimbing.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br>Scaling Mt.

   "body": "<BR><BR>First of all, let’s stop calling the provincial football and athletics (track and field) facility of the Province as  Perdices “Coliseum”. A coliseum is an enclosed facility, with a roof overhead, such as the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, or the Rizal Memorial Basketball Coliseum in Manila. The Rizal Memorial Sports Complex in Manila has the Rizal Baseball Field and the Rizal Track-Football Field. <BR><BR>The appropriate name for the Negros Oriental facility that houses the football and all-weather track oval should be referred to as the “Perdices Athletic Field” or “Perdices Field”. <BR><BR>In 2009, during the watch of then Gov. George Arnaiz, an all-weather rubberized track oval was constructed inside the Perdices Field, and which subsequently, incoming Gov. Emilio “Dodo” Macias II used it to support a bid for Negros Oriental to host the annual Palarong Panbansa. <BR><BR>We lost the right to host the games to Tacloban City, which, I understand, constructed a spanking sports complex with funding support from the Pagcor when former Leyte Cong. Matin Petilla was chairperson.<BR><BR>In several past columns, I wrote about similar facilities located in various parts of the country which were erected at a cost ranging from P50 to P500 million (as that constructed in Tubod, Lanao del Norte) for the annual Palarong Pambansa.   And after the games, these have become virtual “white elephants”. <BR><BR>Wikipedia defines a white elephant as a “valuable possession of which its owner cannot dispose, and whose cost (particularly of upkeep) is out of proportion to its usefulness or worth”. An example is the “Montreal Olympic Stadium built as the main venue for the 1976 Summer Olympics. The stadium’s nickname ‘The Big Owe’ has been used in reference to the astronomical cost of the stadium and the 1976 Olympics as a whole.”<BR><BR>Athletic facilities such as the Perdices Field can become a white elephant, if it is not already one, when the income derived from its usage is not adequate to meet maintenance cost.<BR><BR>This could also happen when there is very minimal events staged there to ensure maximum utilization by potential users, especially by children and youth engaged in structured and regularly-organized sporting activities. <BR><BR>What can the provincial government do to prevent the Perdices Field from becoming a white elephant? I recommend two strategies:<BR><BR>In 2009, Foundation University submitted a proposal to the provincial government to turn over the management of the sports complex facilities (football field, track oval, aqua center, Lamberto Macias Hall, convention hall and the hotel) to the University. <BR><BR>At that time, FU was determined to invest some P50 million to finish the construction of the hotel, and even considered installing an artificial all-weather turf so that the field could be used for all seasons. <BR><BR>We were informed that the proposal was submitted to the provincial legal officer and subsequently, to the Sangguniang Panlalawigan which both approved the offer. <BR><BR>However, up to this time, FU has not been informed of the final action taken by the approving authority. <BR><BR>To manifest FU’s management capability, when the Unigames were held in Dumaguete City in 2008, FU sent a team of landscapers to upgrade the condition of the football field. However, it appears that after this effort on the part of FU to keep the field in tip-top shape, the desirable condition has not been maintained.<BR><BR>This experience suggests that the current provincial government can explore the possibility of adopting the concept of “government-private sector partnership” in the operations of the Perdices Field, a practice which the provincial legal officer and the Provincial Board deemed acceptable.<BR><BR>Another development which the provincial government could be aware of is the current “football mania” being created by the success of the Azcals. <BR><BR>Football fever is sweeping the country and Negrenses, being football lovers, are a potential stakeholders of the plan of football officials to establish a football league that will ultimately grow into a professional league like the PBA. <BR><BR>How can the provincial government take advantage of this development? The answer is the creation of sports clubs, in the cities and municipalities, down to the barangay level.<BR><BR>The model for such a system is seen in FU’s “Youth @ Play” program organized by its Institute of Youth Sports for Peace. <BR><BR>The IYSPeace regularly organizes inter-club tournaments in basketball, volleyball, futsal, and sepak takraw held at such places as the Robinsons Mall, HyperMart, and at FU’s north campus. <BR><BR>These tournaments are participated in by club teams from as far as Bais City. The current champion of futsal is a sports club from Bacong, sponsored by an expat resident there. A regular participant in the “3-on-3” basketball is a club called Lucky Terminal fielded by businessman Sonny Tia. <BR><BR>I understand that Gov. Roel Degamo is in the process of forming a Provincial Sports Council. It might be worthwhile for this Council to consider my twin proposals: bring in the private sector as partners in the management and operation of existing sports facilities; and encourage and support the formation and participation of sports clubs all over the Province to join regularly-scheduled sporting activities.  <BR><BR>And, as we have often manifested, FU, with its long tradition in the sporting life initiated by its former president the late Leandro Sinco, can extend any form of assistance to the local governments in Negros Oriental which will pursue a program in consonance with the UN MDG Task Force in Sports prescription for member- countries to “utilize sports for health, education, social development and peace”.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

It’s an image that has been somewhere in my mind ever since I first saw it. <BR><BR>When I was a boy I was in love with machines. Cameras in particular. Camera were perfect machinery: hi-grade leather and steel, with polished dials and knobs, lenses and viewfinders. Unlike locomotives and machine guns, which I also admired, I had some excuse for owning a camera- I could take pictures! <BR><BR>Well, I got the camera I wanted, and took pictures because that was what it was for, but they were just pictures; of my friends, of my family, of my car; ordinary snapshots, interesting only to the people in them. I knew something was missing, but I didn’t know what.<BR><BR>On my eighteenth birthday, my parents gave me a book of Photographs by Henri Cartier-Bresson. On the card my mother wrote, “Dear Johnny--Maybe this will teach you to take photographs instead of  just snapshots.” I felt a little insulted, but I looked at the book; and I saw what my mom was talking about.<BR><BR>People usually take pictures “of” something: a friend, a car, a soccer game; the “subject” of the picture. For Cartier-Bresson, the “subject” was everything in the frame, taken as a whole; it was not what was “in” the picture, but the picture itself. Every picture projected a strong feeling of its own, regardless of who or what was in it. <BR><BR>Take the picture here: It’s a famous photograph; original prints of it are worth upwards of $10,000 to art collectors. Why? It’s not a picture of any important event, or of  any famous people. <BR><BR>In fact it’s not a picture of anything in particular. It’s just a couple of unknown boys in an alley. The boy on the left is blurred, the boy on the right in shadow, you can hardly see his face. The alley itself is the center of the picture, and it’s empty. <BR><BR>But somehow the light, the shadows, the receding space  of the alley, the expression on the boy’s faces, all combine to produce an image of intense beauty and mystery- once you’ve seen it you can’t forget it. <BR><BR>So, thanks to my parents and Henri Cartier-Bresson, I realized what my camera was really for, and what it was I had to try to do with it.<BR><BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport2-13.jpeg\"><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Astride camels and horses, pro-government riders  galloped  into demonstrators, massed  in Tahrir Square, lashing out with whips and clubs.  <br><br>Within seconds,  a Ghandian-like  peaceful protest  escalated  into a bloody melee.

UN’s  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arab  States  Human  Development Report</span>  describes this  libertarian  red ink. Excerpts: <br><br>“There are vivid contrasts between actual practice and formal support of democracy, human rights and rule of law…” <br><br>Multi-party systems operate in  Algeria, Yemen, and Jordan. Lebanon and Morroco made room for political pluralism. Oman, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates set up  representative  assemblies. Bahrain has an elected president.   <br><br>This   “spate of democratic reforms…has been offset by countermeasures limiting citizens’ rights… Reforms have not changed the structural basis of power. The executive branch  still  dominates, unchecked by any form of accountability…”  <br><br>What  freedom Iraq’s new  constitution gave, with its left hand is snatched back by the right hand of  security clauses.  Extension of the president’s term office followed Alegria’s  Charter for Peace ….<br><br>Except for Libya, Arab states permit civil organizations. But laws hobble their activities.  “Similar patterns are evident in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and the UAE.”<br><br>Despite censorship, Arab autocrats  haven’t  been able to completely suppress reports of “post-modern <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">coup d’etats</span>”  or  “revolts from below”. <br><br> News  on Edsa 1986  spilled across borders.  Lebanon’s “Cedar Revolution” expelled Syrian occupiers.

Angelo Reyes should be separate and distinct from the  subject matter of the Senate inquiry.”<br><br>Filipinos that we are, we have the tendency to  look at events from the heart. We are sentimental people, superstitious, and respectful of the dead. <br><br>The question is asked: “Should the  Senate inquiry continue?” This is when reason and the minds should prevail because these are matters of public concern.  <br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“...The Senate investigating  an area on which it may potentially legislate. It is not required that legislative hearing must result in legislation. The fact that the subject of the investigation  may be undergoing trial does not restrict the power to investigate. The   legislative purpose is different from the judicial purpose.” (Bengzon vs. Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, 203 SCRA 767).</span><br><br>Sorrow and grief follows the death of the late General  Reyes,  but this should not distract the  purpose of the legislative inquiry into the AFP fund mess. These are two separate issues.<br><br>As to the conduct of the Senators, probably they could improve on their language, technique, and demeanor, but this is why we have  elected  Senators.  <br><br>Some of them may have been acting from their hearts not their minds. However, they have  oversight function, they have to check the actions of those in the executive departments. It has to be understood and be clear that once a person occupies a public position and uses public funds, he is accountable to the public. <br><br>In a perfect world, “sovereignty resides in the people and all power emanates from them!” These are not empty words, but in fact, are embodied in the Constitution, the fundamental law of the land. <br><br>Each and every elective and appointive government official, upon taking his  Oath of Office swears to “obey all the laws and uphold the Constitution”.<br><br>Can the media be blamed for  the publicity of the Senate investigations?  Was there trial by publicity? In the first place, that was no trial! It is a legislative inquiry.<br><br>The public has the right to know about how public funds are spent, and if people are onion-skinned, and cannot withstand the glare of public scrutiny, they should not hold public office.

I can let out a sigh of relief and gratitude that the first two days have gone by more or less smoothly.  True, there have been minor hiccups here and there, but on the whole, I think the delegates and the guests are happy.  So long as they’re happy, I’m happy.<br><br>Taboan has been no mean undertaking for us at the Davao Writers Guild. This week, we brought in some 60 writers from all over the Philippines (and three from abroad) to Davao City for a three-day festival/conference.  On paper, the conference consists of panel discussions, speeches, and performances; in reality, well, anything goes. Writing may be a solitary art, but most writers are social creatures, more so than others.<br><br>I won’t bother dropping the names of the writers I’ve met in this conference.  Truth be told and no boast, I’ve met with each and every one of them. While I’ve had the privilege of being delegate to the first two Taboans, this time around I’m the Conference Coordinator.<br><br>That lofty title has meant: with the other three members of the steering committee -- thinking up the panel sessions, arranging them in logical and equitable order, selecting the best speakers and moderators; and on my own -- contacting delegates, getting preferred flight schedules, booking tickets, getting them to Davao safe and sound. And  on top of that, please add web site maintenance, transportation, negotiation, and overall communications.<br><br>In other words, I am the master cat herder.<br><br>And so for this festival, my being a writer and fan has had to take a back seat.  First and foremost, I am organizer and host. Now I have to deal with the writers the way I would with customers and work peers. Be friendly but firm. Troubleshoot first, get autographs later. Tiring as it may be, the momentary transition has not been without benefits: I get glimpses of the real persons underneath.  And what do you know, they’re plain folk, too.<br><br>Yet here’s the beauty and wonder of it all: ordinary as they may be as I deal with them on matters mundane, but when they read from their work, when they convey their ideas, a kind of transfiguration happens. Their art transforms them.  I wonder how THAT could come from such a person, and I am in awe.  And once more, I find myself a fan.<br><br><img \"align=\"LEFT\" \"=\"\" src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Savant1.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br><img \"align=\"LEFT\" \"=\"\" src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Savant2.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br><img \"align=\"LEFT\" \"=\"\" src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Savant3.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br><img \"align=\"LEFT\" \"=\"\" src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Savant4.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br><img \"align=\"LEFT\" \"=\"\" src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Savant5.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br>What is the biggest challenge to mankind today?  Is it crime and corruption, poverty, and the lack of equitable human development?  Is it global warming and the continued degradation of the only environment that has nurtured and sustained us (along with all the other species of plant and animal life on earth) throughout history in this corner of the universe?  <br><br>Indeed, aren’t we condemning ourselves and our unborn generations through our own inhumanity against each other, or our wholesale insensitivity to the long-suffering ecosystem — either or both of which could inevitably lead to our own demise?<br><br>And then there’s that fundamental question: What is the purpose of life? Why are we here?<br><br>Such serious questions, howsoever, do not lend themselves to quick and easy answers, unfortunately.  But whether we like it or not, these are the profound questions which hound us day by day, perhaps only in the background, yet at a progression that grows ever deeper in severity and urgency.  <br><br>If we are to find meaning for our existence, we have to confront these questions — and perhaps do something about it.<br><br>Modern life is so complicated. Yet, for all its complexities, all its troubles and distractions, our modern life has only succeeded in isolating each of us farther away from each other — and this is within the context of a supposedly “shrinking” world.  <br><br>The so-called “global village” of today, made possible through the technological wonders of man’s advancements, is merely a figment of our imagination.  Why?  Because by and large, we still live our lives on the self-preserving basis of adversarial relations and/or apathy.<br><br>With so many more people today on the planet than ever before, ‘competitive advantage’ is what drives most people forward in life.  <br><br>The past two millennia have shaped man into what he is today; but if we are to believe in a manifest destiny for mankind — although we do not know when exactly it will be — it makes us wonder whether or not our future really is pre-determined; or that perhaps it is actually up to us, individually and collectively, to determine our own future.  Or, it may be both — that the future is predetermined by the character of those who shape it.<br><br>Right now, we cannot say what the rest of the world should do.  We are the architects of our own problems, the makers of our own troubles.  We have problems of understanding each other, of following the Golden Rule, of becoming truly united in our communities.  <br><br>But once in a while, we do get to experience small miracles in our lives — some answered prayers; the pain of the past consigned to oblivion by the healing power of forgiveness; seemingly irreconcilable differences being transcended through humility and acceptance.  <br><br>What these experiences reveal is that there is no faith without hope; no justice without compassion; no humanity without fairness.  <br><br>These truths may indicate that there is meaning in our lives, after all… and that life which has no meaning at all is probably not worth living.<br><br>But whether or not there really is some meaning in our existence is an open-ended, deeply personal question; or perhaps life is an individual accident of fate that somehow one can and should resolve through one’s own capacity to change, overcome — to carve out meaningfulness, for one’s self and for others.  <br><br>That’s the human condition — a struggle to survive, and to find purpose and meaning in life.  In the process, we may find each other and recognize that we are not that much different, just defined and delimited outwardly by circumstance and realities; inwardly, by our comprehension and perspectives; and totally by our being finite, fallible… but with a willfulness that transcends everything — the indomitable human spirit.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Carlos Bueno</span><br><a href=\"caloy.bueno@gmail.com\">caloy.bueno@gmail.com</a><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

An option of $35,000 cash can be taken instead of the car. Second prize is $5,000 cash. Third prize is $3,000 cash. And the fourth will consist of four prizes of $500 each.<br><br>NYNJ Chapter President Dely Po Go said, “All the proceeds of this raffle will go entirely to Silliman University, particularly the Student Center Project. NYNJ Chapter will not keep a single cent for itself.”<br><br>As in past fundraisers, NYNJ Chapter has led the way in not only facing the challenge squarely, but also in setting a philosophy that recognizes that an alumni association’s primary concern is to benefit its alma mater. Hence, Mrs. Go added, the chapter is in total support of this present SUACONA initiative, recognizing that the Student Center Project will contribute significantly in the university’s ability to provide excellent student services and in the enrichment of student life on the campus.<br><br>Not only are the raffle prizes enticing, but it also affords a higher statistical probability of winning — only 1,000 tickets will be sold! “The 1,001st buyer will definitely be turned down and his money returned,” emphasized Mrs. Go. “This ensures that each ticket costing $100 will have a 1:1,000 probability of winning. That is just considering the first prize; that probability increases substantially when you put into consideration the six other significant prizes to be won. And this gets more alluring when compared with the bleak odds of winning the lotto, which is 1:250,000,000.”<br><br>Drawing of the raffle will be held on the evening of June 20, during the Gala Night of Tipon Silliman 2011, a biennial gathering of Sillimanians in North America which, this year, will be held in Fairbanks, Alaska. The drawing will be supervised by representatives of the SU administration, SUACONA, NYNJ Chapter, as well as the government of the State of Alaska.<br><br>The official rules of the raffle can be found in the <a href=\"http://www.suacona.com/3/miscellaneous14.htm\">SUACONA website</a>.  A flyer can also be downloaded from the website, which will provide information on how to buy your ticket.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Color-me-red is the catch-cry.  To catch a falling star and put it in the beloved’s pocket. Or a red rose for the beloved.  To be in red is to the passionate.  Courageous.   As to love, according to C.S. Lewis, is to be vulnerable.<br><br>Zaniah means <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">beautiful</span> in Arabic.  Caye means <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">pure</span> in Greek.  Daug is an acronym for Danger Area Users Group.  Creamer is Middle English meaning trader or merchant. Zaniah is beautiful and pure.  As a soldier, she lived dangerously in Kandahar, Afghanistan.  Zaniah and her dog Jofa were ready for anything, anytime, anywhere to sweep buildings safe for her comrades. She created fleeting space of peace just like the calm in the eye of a raging storm.  Zaniah is a star on the left arm of Virgo which has the zodiac attribute to care for others over herself.<br><br>Zaniah Caye Daug Creamer in purpled haze is Fil-Am who returned home last week to Siquijor kissing the sky.  She was blown to death by an improvised bomb in Afghanistan. She returned home to Maria, Siquijor given the full military honors by the USA government.  Her funeral procession Friday was witnessed by Siquijodnons and Dumaguete media persons who covered the solemn event.  <br><br>Among those who covered it was photojournalist Judy Flores Partlow who called her photo coverage posted on Facebook as “The Final Journey of a Hero.” Judy reported Zaniah was awarded meritorious medals by the USA and NATO for dedicating herself to love of country and freedom.  <br><br>Zaniah wove and chased a dream from a country of want to one that is flowing with milk and honey, then to a battle-ridden Afghanistan. Living and dying for it was Zaniah’s reality.<br><br>As an overseas Filipino, I am proud of her.  Just the way I am proud of Manny Pacquiao, Leah Salonga, Charice Pempengco, Ariel Pineda,  Cory Aquino, Jose Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, and Lapulapu.<br><br>Zaniah’s death though is a grim reminder of living and dying by the sword, she lived to give.  She gave up her life so that others may live in peace and freedom.  <br><br>In this sense, she becomes a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">universal soldier</span> as defined by lyricist Sainte Marie Buffy.  The universal soldier exists ever since time began.  He fights for his country against an enemy who is fighting for his own. He may be a believer or an atheist.  But he knows he shouldn’t kill but sadly knows he always kills.  He decides who is to live and who is to die.  He never sees the writing on the wall as he gives his body as a weapon of war.<br><br>Angelo means the messenger.  Angelo “Angie” Reyes was a President-maker.  He was Armed Forces chief of staff when the AFP withdrew its support from President Estrada in EDSA II -- one of three Filipino people power revolutions.  The AFP’s withdrawal of support for the incumbent catapulted GMA to the Presidency.  His effort was wasted on the way. In GMA’s reign, the two cultures of corruption and impunity were widely perceived by most Filipinos to have recklessly rioted.<br><br>Angie was a well-respected man.  After he retired as AFP chief, he served in various capacities in GMA’s cabinet--Transport, Energy, to DENR secretary.  <br><br>Just last week, he was publicly humiliated in a congressional investigation looking into the AFP’s slush fund.  The stench of corruption from the previous regime was quite demeaning.  It stained Angie’s impeccable public record.  As it threatened to drag the good family name into the sewers, he took his own life. His message -- a Filipino national catharsis.<br><br>Love is.  Love for self, love for country, love God.  Love is “I am”. God is Love.  That is the greatest of them all. Even suffering is turned into something good because God’s love is always and forever transformational. <br><br>Happy Valentine!  <br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

That was immediately apparent when I first saw &#960; [Pi, 1998] years and years ago. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Pi</span> was about an obsessive number theorist named Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) who struggles to understand the string of numbers hidden in the Torah and with a mysterious 216-digit number his computer not-so-randomly spat out one day. Later on, we see Max’s cinematic cousins in Ellen Burstyn’s Sara Goldfarb who struggles to fit into an old red dress with the use of amphetamines in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Requiem for a Dream</span> [2000], Hugh Jackman’s Tommy who struggles to find a cure for his wife’s brain tumor in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Fountain</span> [2006], and Mickey Rourke’s Robin Ramzinski who struggles with an ailing heart to win one last match in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Wrestler</span> [2008]. <br><br>Now, in the terrific and terrifying Black Swan [2010], Aronofsky unveils his new obsessive in Natalie Portman’s Nina Sayer, a ballet dancer known for perfect technique but not for raw uninhibition needed to truly achieve riveting dance. She begins to lose her mind, in a living nightmare reminiscent of Roman Polanski’s Repulsion [1965], as she struggles to lose her straight-laced constraints to truly become the titular ballet role. Her perfection—dull and unseductive—slowly cracks.<br><br>Mr. Aronofsky knows. He knows the terrible beauty and the exacting nature of artistry or the search for that perfection or ideal. In his previous films, however, one does not get a close-enough cinematic depiction of the need—or the hunger—to achieve that artistic ideal. In <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Black Swan</span>, he finally does. Take note of that transformation scene when Nina finally breathes in her terrible achievement: she glows and menaces and walks around the backstage like a predator in ecstasy. I recognized that walk, that breathing, that deadly seduction set in the eyes. I told myself, that’s it—that’s the familiar high we get when we are in the very depths of the artistic zone. Mr. Aronofsky perfectly renders it. Which is why I love this film. It is not subtle, and does not aim to be—and so one should not fault it for being the visceral assault that it is. It perfectly captures that throbbing sensuality of having to surrender, little by little, all that we are in the service of our art. And if we have to die for it, we do so with the comfort of knowing we have created something immortal in the process, the applause we get becoming a mere trifle in the exquisite bloodletting it requires.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">        * * *<br></div><br><br>        I strangely find it difficult to articulate what I feel after seeing Jeffrey Friedman and Rob Epstein’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Howl</span> [2010] tonight. I came out of the Bijou knowing perfectly well what I felt about it: that I loved it. But why exactly? For most movies, it’s easy to give a reason for one’s liking or disliking its story, its themes, or its craftsmanship, opinions that ultimately boil down to the film’s handling of its formalistic elements. But the film is not like any other movie. It is not a typical narrative film told in a straight, conventional manner. In fact has the feel of a documentary. (Then again, the directors are primarily documentary filmmakers; both are responsible for what I consider to be the best chronicle about gayness in the history of film, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Celluloud Closet</span>.) Its structure is interesting bricolage. And its subject matter is quite unusual for a feature film. Perhaps it tickled my literary or intellectual fancy—this is a film that will be devoured by any creative writing and literary criticism major. I know that sounds snobbish, but in an age of filmmaking that is inundated by <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Transformers</span> movies and their ilk, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Howl</span> becomes a breath of fresh air. Of course, there is a reason why the film takes its title from the pathbreaking poem by Allen Ginsberg, the beat writer who has become a generational icon and who is brilliantly portrayed in this film by James Franco. The reason is because it is a film of and about the poem, perhaps the first feature film that actually tries to do a cinematic treatment of a poem. (Is there any other poem that has gotten this cinematic treatment?) One may easily be led to believe though, from what we hear about the film in the grapevine, that this is a biopic. It is not. We do get generous snippets episodes (as well as psychoanalysis) of Ginsberg’s life, but these episodes are in the service of telling the story of the poem “Howl”. It is a film about its creation and about the furor of the obscenity case that was leveled against its publication by City Lights in San Francisco. It is also a film about its utterance—in a sense, a reading of the poem set to a visual rendition. And according to Stanley Fish, this is also the first film to do a thorough depiction of the act of literary criticism. I love the film. It is unusual, especially in terms of structure. There are four acts here that weave together in a kind of documentary finish: <br><br>Ginsberg being interviewed about the poem, Ginsberg’s first reading of the poem at Six Gallery in San Francisco in 1955, the 1957 obscenity trial against its publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and the entire poem read and set in animation. Each thread comment and enlighten each other, and so in a sense Fish is right: the film becomes an act of close-reading, the first of its kind I see rendered in cinema. This will not be everybody’s cup of tea —but for those who are receptive for films that talk about literature, its creative process, its interpretative strategies, and its eventual reach for relevance or impact to society in general, this is the film to devour and watch, again and again and again. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(Next: Rabbit Hole, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, and The Fighter…)</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Sometimes, they already know of the news by the time we get to them,” he said.<br><br>He says they go far to reach out because these soldiers are not only considered family but they also gave the ultimate sacrifice.<br><br>“The service we provide is to walk with families through the grief process to provide closure,” he says. <br><br>Although his job is civilian in nature, he thinks of it as a continuation of his 19 years of military service where he retired as Command sergeant major in 1992. “I was a special forces medic whose job was to keep people alive. Now I take care of them in death.”<br><br>Of the 15 Filipino-American deaths in the US Army since 2002,  Macfarland has either personally supervised the funeral arrangements of 10 remains in the Philippines, or had to deal with the deceased’s family here. <br><br>In all cases, Macfarland says, no interpreter is necessary because they send someone who speaks the local language.<br><br>Macfarland was in Dumaguete and Siquijor Province last week to bring back the remains of Filipino-American Sgt. Zainah Caye Creamer, 28, a military dog handler who was killed in an attack by insurgents on Jan. 12 in Kandahar, Afghanistan.<br><br>MacFarland says that his usual experience in the Philippines is that the family and the government are proud of what the soldiers are doing. “It’s touching for me,” he says.<br><br>Becoming a mortician had always been at the back of his mind even during his younger days. “I feel I’m doing God’s work by doing this, and my wife of 35 years is very supportive to my calling.”<br><br>Aside from attending to funeral arrangements, Macfarland takes care of travel arrangements for family members in the Philippines who attend a  soldier’s burial in the US.<br><br>Macfarland says he sometimes gets emotionally- affected, especially when the departed soldier was just starting a family. “I have to take a few steps back, and take a deep breath,” he adds.<br><br>Another part of his job is to conduct search and retrieval operations for American servicemen in <br>the Asia-Pacific, such as the 2002 crash of a Chinook CH 47 helicopter, seven miles southeast of Apo Island in Negros Oriental.<br><br>MacFarland had chartered a salvage vessel to the Philippines, and spent two weeks here, recovering the wreckage and eight remains of the 10 servicemen who were killed in that crash. <br><br>“We take care of our own,” he says, “Our motto is ‘Never leave a fallen hero behind’ and no expense is ever too big.”<br><br>MacFarland also investigates deaths involving US soldiers as  a forensic investigator and deputy medical examiner, like in the case of Lt. Cmdr. Scintar Buenviaje Mejia, who allegedly jumped to his death while in handcuffs last December from the second floor of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport after he was arrested for possession of cocaine. “It was no suicide,” he says, “the evidence doesn’t back the story.”<br><br>MacFarland’s report into the Mejia incident will be released soon.<br><br>Now 65, MacFarland looks forward to more years in his job. “As long as I enjoy what I’m doing, I will continue doing what I can. As they say, when you quit having fun, that’s when you need to quit.”<br><br><br><img \"align=\"LEFT\"\" src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/McFarland2.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The first article was written by Nadia and Rene Abesamis.  -- Editors</span><br><br>In celebration of Healthy Lifestyle Month, this Dumaguete-based couple is appreciated as one of the examples of living healthy lifestyles who came upon each other from two different worlds and experiences. This is the story of Cobbie and Dessa Quesada-Palm.<br><br>Sleepless evenings battling asthma attacks through elementary school define Dessa’s memory of childhood, and her turning to alternative remedies to the pharmaceutically-prescribed solutions. <br><br>Her asthma, coupled with her rheumatic heart disease, rendered her lackluster and lethargic most of her childhood years. <br><br>Vivid in her memory was a critical moment when the hospital and pharmaceuticals had failed to relieve her, and her mother rushed her to an acupuncturist in the Ongpin area of Manila where acupuncture needles saved her life.  <br><br>“A moment like that has a profound and dramatic impact on your life forever,” she exclaims, “and it opened my eyes to the multiple dimensions of healing.”<br><br>The acupuncturist shared information on a proper healthy diet, and then looked at the young Dessa in the eyes, and said, “You need to exercise your lungs.”<br><br>Dessa took to the new diet of vegetable, grains, fish, and fresh food. The search for a way to exercise her lungs took her to the Philippine Education Theater Association (PETA) teen theater workshop the following summer as a high school freshman. <br><br>The principle was that theater will move one  physically, and demand  one’s lungs to respond to both the physical and vocal demands of acting. <br><br>“It was the summer that turned my life around,” Dessa says, smiling “from being the sickly unmotivated young girl of my elementary school class, to becoming the life of the party.”  <br><br>The “life of the party” very well describes the vivacious spirit of Dessa today who simply says, “My near-death experience gave me a new lease on life, my eyes were opened to alternative healing practices, to the value of proper dieting, and to the importance of staying physically fit. These three, I can truly say, are the reasons I am here today.”  <br><br>Unable to comprehend people who fall ill defines Cobbie’s childhood years. “I was ill so seldom that I do not have any memory of illness,” says Cobbie.  <br><br>Life for Cobbie was pushing the physical limits at an early age. Memories of exploring the possibilities of skydiving with an umbrella from the rooftop, and learning the hard way that it does not work; the building of a jump ramp for the bicycle, and lining up boxes underneath to jump over -- pretending they were cars; and taking a scooter to the highest hill in the neighborhood to see how fast it could go down, are all part of Cobbie’s formative years.  <br><br>“I was reckless and at times, I thought I was indestructible, but I believe this was my headstart program in the making of a passion and ability for athletic excellence.”<br><br>The athletic abilities that came almost naturally to Cobbie did not always bring peaceful results. There were times when it was a burden and even a danger.  <br><br>As Cobbie tells the story, “I remember transferring to a new school as an elementary student, and soon after my first gym class, a coach spotted me, and invited me to the football team,  and almost immediately, I was given the coveted position of quarterback.  At practice a few weeks later, the young boy whose position I had unknowingly stolen, came to the field with a trench coat, and started walking toward me. At about three meters away from me, he opened the trench coat and I saw he was holding a kitchen knife. Thanks to my headstart program, I just ran faster than I ever did before.” <br><br>From an early age, athletic ability has been an instrument of survival for Cobbie, and later, it translated into the tennis scholarship that supported his academic program.  <br><br>“It was the discipline of representing the school in NCAA level competition that tamed my reckless and indestructible attitude,” says Cobbie. “I adopted the mantra ‘God creates the opportunity but Cobbie has to perfect the delivery’.  I came to understand that to perfect the delivery, my part in the performance equation needed the discipline of serious practice, a healthy diet, and a clean lifestyle.  And there are no shortcuts.” <br> <br>The lives of Dessa and Cobbie began to converge in 2002. Their coming together was the meeting of healthy lifestyles from two different contexts. Dessa’s from the perspective of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">finding strength from  weakness. Cobbie’s from the perspective of taming strength to overcome weakness. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br>Looking back through lives, they picked up these proven lessons from their journey. Whether you are feeling fragile or indestructible:<br><br>1)A healthy diet and exercise is a discipline to becoming the best that you can be.<br>2) A healthy diet and exercise builds the stamina to perform well in your job, relate more fully to loved ones, and get through each day with energy.<br>3) A healthy diet and exercise makes your mind clearer, your soul cleaner, and your body happier. <br>4) A healthy diet and exercise transforms your body and skin into youthful appeal.<br>5) A healthy diet and exercise links you with new and interesting people.<br>6) A healthy diet and exercise is a covenant with God, ensuring the stewardship of one’s instrument for service and ministry.<br><img \"align=\"LEFT\"\" src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Health-Dessa.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br><img \"align=\"LEFT\"\" src=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Health-Cobbie.jpg\" border=\"0\"><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

She has a sad, distracted look as though her mind were far away on personal problems elsewhere, and it probably is; but you will never know what she’s thinking.<BR><BR>She’s a “helper”, as they say here; a combination maid, cook, nanny and laundress. Every family here with any education and income at all has at least one helper- and many families have more. Helpers are part of the basic local social structure.<BR><BR>They come from remote barangays, or from small towns up in the mountains above the city. They’re hired informally, by word of mouth. <BR><BR>There’s no formal contract between you and a new helper -just a brief discussion as to what their duties will be and what you will pay, usually not much; but then they don’t expect much. <BR><BR>If you don’t like their work, you can fire them; if they don’t like you, they can disappear without warning. It’s a relationship that may last for a week, or for many years. For those who, like me, come from a “First World” country, it’s a very strange relationship indeed.<BR><BR>In Europe and America, most people have machines to do their daily chores. But here, there’s a person to do these things for you, and your relationship to that person is one of extreme intimacy, and extreme distance at the same time.<BR><BR>Here’s someone who lives in your house, who can’t help but know the most intimate details of your private life, someone who washes your underwear and cooks your food every day. In America, only your parents, or your spouse, would ever be allowed to get that close to you.  <BR><BR>And yet your helper is not even your friend. You have only limited responsibility for her, and there are social boundaries between you that can’t be crossed. It’s how the world works here. You can only accept it, and be thankful that people are willing work so close to you for so little. <BR><BR>You can, if you wish, treat your helper as a kind of machine, a robot, and many people do; they spend a lot of time complaining when this “robot” does not perform as expected.<BR><BR>But look again at this woman washing your windows, washing your clothes, cooking your food: and always remember that she knows you, for better or worse, much more than you will ever know her.<BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport2-20.jpg\"><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

After all, the road to cityhood for Guihulngan had been a seesaw battle for the past three years.<BR><BR>In November 2008, the Supreme Court nullified the laws creating the 16 cities, citing a violation in the Constitution. The 16 LGUs filed a motion for reconsideration which the Supreme Court denied. The LGUs filed a second appeal which the Supreme Court denied with a vote of 6-6.<BR><BR>On May 21, 2009, the Supreme Court said it would no longer allow any pleadings on the case. However, the town mayors asked the Supreme Court to resolve the second motion for reconsideration that was decided by a deadlock. The SC entertained its motion and came up with a decision in December 2009 that said  that the 16 laws creating the cities are constitutional.<BR><BR>Now, it was the turn of the League of Cities of the Philippines to file a motion for reconsideration asking the Supreme Court to declare the cityhood bid of the 16 towns unconstitutional. The Supreme Court, in August of 2010, revoked the cityhood of the 16 towns.<BR><BR>The 16 town mayors then filed a motion to reverse the August 2010 ruling, which the Supreme Court approved last week, leading to this grand celebration.<BR><BR>It is a well-entrenched principle that the Supreme Court can never be wrong.

   "body": "<BR><BR>River systems of the Philippines are some of most neglected ecosystems of the country, and only very few of them have been studied. The majority are in various stages of degradation. Many of them are drying up mainly because of the denudation of the forested areas serving as source of their water supplies. <BR><BR>In many parts of the country, people are not aware of the importance of rivers in serving to connect the land and the sea. This connection makes possible the operation of nutrient cycles involving oceans and terrestrial ecosystems and the movement of animal and plant species between land and sea that maintain the natural productivity of natural habitats. Human populations depend so much on this natural productivity.<BR><BR>Worse still, the lack of the awareness of the importance of rivers to human welfare has resulted in the severe pollution of river systems. People throw all kinds of materials into rivers including domestic und industrial wastes, trash, garbage, etc. thinking that they are getting rid of all these. <BR><BR>Little do they know that natural processes cause toxic chemicals to enter the human food chains, thus coming back to them. A good example is mercury that becomes part of fish eaten by people in areas where mining activities have polluted aquatic ecosystems.  <BR><BR>The Commission on Higher Education is aware of these problems.  Two years ago, it began to support a research program on river systems in the Central and Western Visayas regions to be conducted by colleges and universities in these regions. <BR><BR>The first phase of this program involved the faculty members and researchers of nine colleges and universities on Negros and Panay, who studied two river systems, the Bago River in Negros Occidental and the Jalaur River in Iloilo. (More studies are being conducted on other rivers in the two regions.) <BR><BR>These studies will be reported in “The Symposium on the Jalaur and Bago River Studies, Western Visayas”  to be held at the HTM Center of La Consolacion College Bacolod City on Feb. 22-23, 2011.<BR><BR>There are 15 presentations in the Bacolod City symposium. The papers will deal with the biodiversity, including fisheries; hydrology and water quality of these two rivers; and socio-economics of the human communities. <BR><BR>The research exercise is expected to improve the research capabilities of the nine academic institutions, to contribute to the knowledge on Philippine biodiversity (including new species of fish), to highlight the economic significance of these two river systems (including tourism potentials, health hazards, natural productivity), to emphasize the need for healthy river systems and the need for river clean-ups), and  to point out policies and action programs for LGUs to undertake to achieve a sustainable environment.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Public officials and employees shall be at all times accountable to the people and shall discharge their duties with utmost responsibility, integrity, competence, and loyalty, act with patriotism and justice, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lead modest lives</span>, and uphold public interest over personal interest.” (Sec. 2 of R.A. 6713, Code of Conduct and ethical Standards for Public officials and Employees);<br><br>This is the essence of  People Power under the Social Contract Theory when the people elect public officials, they have entrusted to these officials the affairs of government with the duty to abide by the stated principles. <br><br>When government officials  commit acts like malversation or diversion of public funds to private pockets, this is a betrayal of public trust. <br><br>And when such acts will be too heavy to tolerate, the people can withdraw their support to the government. This is what happened on Feb. 25 -26 , 1986, and which was repeated in Tunisia and Egypt in 2011.<br><br>The people have the right to know, and to act on the knowledge that some people in government have betrayed the trust reposed in their public positions. There is no room  for  accommodation or  respect for the privacy of the persons who are involved in the use, management, administration, and liquidation of public funds -- because they took it unto themselves, voluntarily under  the official oath of office to uphold the Constitution, and to obey the laws of the republic.<br><br>While there may be  allowances for the basic tenets of  “Good Manners and Right Conduct”, what has to be taken up  with regards to public funds must be up for public scrutiny. <br><br>Did these erring officials  have in their minds the sensitivity to respect the rights of the people when they obtained for their own benefit the public funds intended for  salaries of soldiers? Is it not that they felt they were entitled to these “sluch funds” by virtue of their public office? So why should they invoke “privacy”when brought  before the Senate or Congress for public scrutiny and censure?<br><br>Cong. Walden  Bello (former professor of Political Science at Columbia University)  referred to corrupt officials as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">buaya</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">baboy</span> because these acts amount to the greediness of the crocodile and the filthiness of the pig. The crocodiles and the pigs may complain because such acts are innate in their nature, but humans are supposed to act in a higher order of behavior. <br><br>Cong. Rodolfo Farinias had said: “There is honor among thieves, how much more among congressmen?!”<br><br>Honor is about honesty, integrity, accountability, and  humility, and with the exception of a few,  the  recent events proved that there are some  members of Congress who are not so honorable namely: Ecleo for  malversation of public funds; Singson for drug charges in Hongkong.<br><br>It is time for our public officials  to recall and practice the essence of People Power.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

This shift has effects on the attitudes and behavior of both professors and students.<br><br>Central in the success of the Internet use is the professor. When they play their role constantly in the configuration of the learning process, the students seem to perform at higher levels, according to Byron and Gagliardi (1998). <br><br>This role requires the professors to see “a clear relation between the use of ICT and the learning curriculum”. <br><br>Otherwise, if the professors will only use the facilities to perform functions of traditional teaching, the technological benefits for student learning will not be ensured. <br><br>Activities involving the use of the Internet need to be carefully structured by the professor for promoting critical thinking and problem-solving skills among the students, according to Byron and Gagliardi. Professors should “assign well-designed project in which students use the Internet to gather information”.<br><br>However, the combination of unfamiliarity, time and extra effort demanded for the effective use of the Internet affects the professors’ attitude towards the technology. Providing the professors the needed support that allows them to be well adapted to their teaching situation is imperative, according to Egnatof (1996). Byron and Gagliardi further state that “… it is not only vital for equipping educators with the necessary skills for using ICTs effectively, but for helping them overcome their often strong resistance to these technologies and to develop positive attitudes towards them.” <br><br>Adequate training for professors, however, should not be a one-shot mission. Indeed, their skills have to be continually and regularly updated in order to meet new demands posed by the rapidly advancing technologies. <br><br>The most promising outcomes in teaching and learning by using the Internet appears in classes where professors are oriented to the effective use of online tools and resources and that their pedagogical performances are more advanced. <br><br>Therefore, they have to be confident and discriminating in using the technology; it implies the development and refinement of both technical and pedagogical skills.<br><br>The effective and creative use of Internet in graduate education demands long-term commitment on the part of the professors in order to overcome many technical obstacles and acquire considerable technical knowledge. <br><br>In addition to the technical requirements, there are questions concerning the values that Internet use expresses and what it means for a professor to use the technology wisely and effectively.<br><br>As many students are now much more familiar and competent than their professors are in using the Internet, professors need to adjust their traditional roles and become more competent or risk falling behind.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Dr. Julhusin B.

The article was sent to me by Mr. Fred Block, with whom I have worked for many years as a volunteer for amateur boxing in the United States. I am a ringside physician, and would like to offer a counter point to Dr. Merqui’s statements, many of which I disagree with. I hope you will publish my letter. Thank you for your consideration.<br><br>I read the article by Dr. Mequi in the November 7-14 issue of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Dumaguete Metro Post</span>.  I understand the position that many physicians take regarding the sport. To be honest, at the professional level, I think the sport is an extremely tough way to make a living, and the boxers are at high risk for acute and chronic brain injury. Amateur boxing, however, is <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">completely</span> different. Although I was initially quite skeptical, having been a ringside physician for over 14 years I am amazed at the overall safety of the sport compared to other contact sports (e.g. football, hockey, lacrosse), and the lengths the adult organizers go to in order to ensure and improve safety for the participants. Do concussions occur? Of course they do, but that is true of all contact sports. The difference is that when an amateur boxer gets a concussion, or even is suspected of one, the match is ended, he or she is examined by an attending physician, and appropriate medical steps are taken, including a mandatory exclusion from sparring for at least one month. What other contact sport takes such precautions with their athletes? I am also impressed that the vast majority of coaches place the safety of the boxers as the highest priority, and together with the referees and physicians, work together to make sure the sport is safe and rewarding for the kids. For many kids, I think the amateur boxing programs provide one of the safest, most productive, and valuable environments available. Though I do not doubt the sincerity of Dr. Mequi’s concerns, his commentary indicates that he has had no actual experience in amateur boxing programs.<br><br>As a ringside physician I am very receptive to quality medical data regarding amateur boxing, as are my colleagues. We discuss such studies when we meet, and some of us are actively involved in research in this area. However, I am not persuaded by the arguments of physicians who have a personal issue with the sport, and are willing to invoke data taken from professional boxing and inappropriately apply it to amateur, Olympic-style boxing. My personal experience of 14 years, as well as that of my committed and caring medical colleagues, is at odds with Dr. Mequi’s opinions. Using phrases like “Child Abuse” is not only an absurd hyperbole aimed at stirring up passions, it shows a total lack of understanding about the sport and organization of amateur boxing. Just as I welcome the opportunity to attend medical symposia dealing with the issue of brain injury in sports, I would implore Dr. Mequi and his associates to spend some time at the gym with the boxing program so they can observe first hand how safe it is, and how committed the organizers (the vast majority of whom are volunteers) are to ensuring and improving participant safety.<br> <br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Steven Brooks, MD</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Augusta, Georgia</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">United States</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

In fact, reports of drug dealing by one of their policemen, PO2 Victorio Rizaldo, and by Renwil Cadungog, a member of the City’s police auxiliary unit, reached not only the City’s chief of police, but also Bayawan City’s top officials as early as last year.<BR><BR>But nobody had proof.  The City turned to the Task Force Kasaligan for help in busting their illegal dealings.<BR><BR>Weeks of intelligence gathering paid off Wednesday night after Rizaldo, 34, and Cadungog, 21, were nabbed in a buy-bust operation by members of the TFK.<BR><BR>National Bureau of Investigation Dumaguete Asst. Chief Miguel Dungog led the TFK team, composed of members of the PNP Provincial Intelligence Branch and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Administration.   <BR><BR>Rizaldo was caught in the act of selling P20,000 worth of shabu to a TFK asset in one of the policeman’s rented apartments at Pink House, Brgy. Suba, Bayawan City.<BR><BR>Acting on a signal from the TFK asset, the operatives moved in to arrest Rizaldo, who by then, had locked himself inside his apartment.<BR><BR>The TFK operatives gained entry into the apartment by destroying the front and back doors, and were greeted by the sight of Rizaldo pointing his shotgun at the TFK operatives.  But Rizaldo surrendered when he saw that he was surrounded.<BR><BR>Cadungog, on the other hand, tried to block the lawmen from searching the house but he surrendered after Rizaldo advised him to do so.<BR><BR>After their arrest, Rizaldo and Cadungog also surrendered their “runner” for their drug operation, whom police identified as Florante Taburda.<BR><BR>Dungog said they conducted the operation after they received a request from Bayawan City Mayor Rene Gaudiel and the members of the City Council led by Vice Mayor Ismael Martinez and Councilor Bon Duque, who chairs the Peace and Order Committee in the City Council.<BR><BR>Confiscated from Rizaldo’s apartment were two plastic sachets containing crystals believed to be shabu, P 20,000 in cash,  shabu paraphernalia, two cellphones and two digital weighing scales.<BR><BR>The TFK also confiscated from Rizaldo a 12-gauge Akkar Shotgun, one 5.56 caliber Norinco M4 Type Rifle, two caliber .22 long rifles squibman, one caliber 5.56 AK 2000, one 9MM KG9 submachine gun, one caliber 45 NORINCO pistol, two live hand grenades, five fully-loaded AK2000 5.56 caliber magazines, nine fully loaded M16 magazines, two fully loaded KG9 9mm magazines, two fully loaded caliber 45 pistol magazines,  one sound suppressor for the KG9, several rounds of 12 gauge shotgun bullets 50 pcs., one box containing 23 pieces of caliber .22 LR, two .38 cal.. handguns, eight .22 cal magnum bullets, and eight rounds for the .45 caliber pistol. <BR><BR>Dungog said Rizaldo and his aides are now facing charges for violating Section 5 and 11 of Article 2 of Republic Act 9165 for selling and possessing drugs, and PD 1866 as amended by RA 8294  for possession of  illegal firearms and ammunitions.<BR><BR>Dungog warned the others engaged in drug selling in Bayawan to stop their illegal trade as soon as possible or they, too, will be arrested. <BR><BR>Other members of the Task Force Kasaligan that arrested P02 Victorio Rizaldo were SP03 Douglas Ferrer, P02 Glenn Corsame, P02 Mark Jester Ayunting, P02 Bernard Pedeglorio, P02 Jerry Magsayo, NBI Agent Nick Tagle.<BR><BR>Rizaldo and Cadungog’s boss, Bayawan Chief of Police C/Insp. Errol Garchitorena admitted that he knew of their activities all along. He said he had always warned Rizaldo to stop “if ever he has illegal activities” so as not to destroy the image of the police force. “But Rizaldo did not heed my advice,” he said.<BR><BR>Provincial Police Director Sr. Supt Rey Lyndon Lawas, for his part, said running after drug-dealing policemen is one of his priorities.<BR><BR>“This is part of cleansing our ranks. Let this be a warning to all not only to the police but also to other members of the community who are into illegal activities,” he said.

   "body": "<BR><BR>I must admit I am not a health buff. Jojo, my husband, is even more: he is a fanatic. He plays basketball, golf, racquetball, bikes, runs, hikes. At home, there is no day he will not tinker with a Tiger Woods golf game either in the computer or with Wii, or watch Solar Sports or the golf channel. His life revolves around a healthy regimen that when his work takes him too late without time to play, he complains his muscles ache. I obviously cannot relate.<BR><BR>When I was at St. Louis Elementary School, I played the dodge ball, takyan, marble and Chinese garter. Any form of sports was only because it was mandatory at PE class. As far as I could remember, I always had other responsibilities given by my teachers. <BR><BR>At high school, I played badminton on my freshman year but ended up being Intramural Manager the rest of my high school years I virtually had not time to indulge in sports or sportsmanship other than during PE class.  I usually was the head of the Cheering Team in school games. <BR><BR>At College in Silliman, my hands were simply full with the Student Government. Not that I regret it.  Sans any sports, my growing up years seemed normal. It’s just that when one gets older, just mere walking around cannot anymore burn enough calories to “flatten the belly” or “burn the fat”. After having two childbirths through C section, the pregnancy bulge does not seem to go away.<BR><BR>Having a husband like Jojo has been monumental in putting a more healthy direction into my lifestyle. <BR><BR>Before we wed, he convinced me to try taebo so I could fit into my wedding clothes. It was fun and I convinced two childhood friends, Audrey and Chipay, to join me. Really, doing a daily healthy routine matters when done with friends. <BR><BR>I then shifted to yoga with Cathy Carballo after marriage. Even when I was carrying our twins, Jojo bought me a pregnancy yoga tape to follow every morning. That routine had to stop when we knew six months later we were to have twins. <BR><BR>After childbirth, I tried to go back to yoga but they had shifted to the more complex and strength-demanding Ashtanga yoga while I could barely handle. I tried my own walking sessions every other week because getting up in the mornings is just too difficult. I just did a good diet of eating only three meals a day which helped me trim fast.<BR><BR>A second pregnancy came after six years. Any woman who has had two or more pregnancies will testify to the fact that after a second childbirth, the belly busting is doubly difficult. <BR><BR>I joined the campaign in 2010 which necessitated walking three to four hours a day. That exercise brought about by the electoral exercise hastened by going back to shape. <BR><BR>Of course, it was triply taxing. You cannot imagine! It was just in time when in June, Cathy introduced me to a new exercise- Walk Live, a kind of power-walking in place. It was really good. Jojo would wake me up every single morning and take me to Cathy’s yoga sanctuary so I would not miss a session. We did two miles in 45 minutes, which increased to three miles after two months. <BR><BR>The demands of my work and family tasks (which included frequent travels and spending more time with the children at night), however, made waking up during the mornings too difficult.  I am now confined to walking from the house to work, and even downtown when I need something that I could get within the proximity of the Central Business District, and eating a balanced diet three times a day. <BR><BR>I sincerely wish I could pull myself to join Cathy and other friends at Walk Live again. It seems like the perfect healthy respite for me.  <BR><BR> I honestly do not belong to the group who can be looked up to as exemplars of staying fit and healthy. Jojo probably does. As for me, I simply maintain a simple recipe of health: balanced diet, lots of water and rest, a loving family, and faith in God. I suppose above all the exercise, it is really peace of mind and contentment that can bring glow in anyone’s life. <BR><BR>Our hemophiliac twins give us inspiration to stay healthy so we can take care of them. We make it a point that when we lecture to them about eating the right food, we also practice what we preach.  <BR><BR>Having a healthy lifestyle is a work in progress for us.  I am no health buff or health expert. I tell you, though, that in this month of love, lots and lots of love and caring will certainly contribute to having a balanced and healthy family life. I thank God for this marriage which has helped me become healthier.<BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/Health-JojoAntonio.jpg\"><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Reality is now-here, is nowhere.  Reality is Heaven.  Heaven is reality.  A crazy and never-ending merry-go-round that makes it paramount for everyone to have a reality check.  Reality bites.  Realities in human being and human doing--one in the state of grace, the other in disgrace.<br><br>Reality shocks when one is too engrossed in  human doing.  It rends.  It sent shock waves  across the nation the way Angie shook the entire Filipino nation.  <br><br>Felt betrayed, he took matters into his own hands to throw the Filipinos into national catharsis.  Very typical of a human doing.  A decorated military officer and a gentleman from sole to crown, he walked in the corridors of power.  Personally and financially successful, he was the envy of ordinary people. Until one day, in the middle of a Senate investigation (humiliation in aid of congressmen’s self-aggrandizement and holier-than-thou attitude), he did a Richard Cory.  He put a bullet into his heart in front of his mother’s grave for family and the warrior’s code of honor.  <br><br>Pomp and power proved insufficient to cleanse the Augean stable, the nation of the stinking corruption.  It corrupts everyone to the core of one’s soul.<br><br>Reality rocks especially when you are a Sillimanian.  It captivates.  It excites the way Alice is enjoying it for being a Sillimanian as it does for all the Sillimanians now living here in Sydney.  Being Sillimanian is to live life in the spirit of thanksgiving.<br><br>Through Alice’s eyes as presiding officer, thanksgiving gave a jump-start to the SU Sydney Chapter meeting on 12th of February at the Sauer family home in Wentworth Falls. <br><br>Wentworth Falls is a town in the Blue Mountains.  It is 100 kms west of Sydney, and 867m above sea level.  Wentworth is worth the tourists’ while for its lakeside picnics, bush-walking, and historic buildings.  It is where Walter and Lucy Sauer’s home is nestled.  The cozy home has the character of a mystic and an artist.<br><br>The meeting started with Ciel reading what “Silliman Spirit” means by Rev. Dr. Lourdino A. Yuzon.  According to  Reverend Yuzon, it is the intangible and defining mark of  Sillimanian’s being and doing.  <br><br>Silliman spirit is Sillimanian ethos of faith and truth imbibed at the the SU classrooms, courts, and halls before the student roam the world near and far.  Sillimanian immerses into the world as a person of faith and truth.  <br><br>This is the story of Outstanding Sillimanian Awardees.  Lucy Sauer is one.  During the gathering, she showed fellow Sillimanians a room full of her OSA memorabilias in last year’s SU Founders Day.  Soaring on eagle’s wings.  Sillimanians present broke and belted the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Silliman Song</span>.<br><br>During the meeting, Anxy proposed for the  Sydney Chapter to bid for next year’s Sillimanian <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Tipon</span>.  Why not?  Silliman spirit is border-less. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Tipon</span> is gathering. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Tipon</span> is quickening of the gathering of Sillimanians as One--anytime, anywhere -- coming together to be the potent salt of the earth and light of the world.<br><br>Creation-oriented and self-centered, reality rends.

The older brothers of Joseph sold him like an animal to merchants on their way to Egypt simply because their brother was their father’s favorite son.  <br><br>And so here before Jesus was another man coming to him, hoping that the Lord would convince his brother to divide his inheritance with him.  But instead of getting the sympathy of Jesus, the man hears a strong word of rebuke from the Lord, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.”  </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br>Jesus is always an excellent judge of character.  It does not take a long time before our hearts are exposed before the blazing eyes of God.  The Lord knew that this man before him had very serious issues on greed. The fact that this man wanted something that clearly did not belong to him exposed his self-indulgence. <br><br>Seizing the opportunity to impart a word of advice, Jesus narrated a parable about a young man who amassed wealth beyond what he truly needed.  Not knowing when to stop his quest for wealth, the young man planned to build bigger storage barns to hoard  his harvest, and take life easy for the rest of his life.  God enters into a conversation with the rich young man giving him the most shocking reality check of all: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?” </span><br><br>You see, friends, every so often, we need to be stopped from our self-serving fantasies, and be jolted back to the reality of our nothingness before God, and the reality that life is not about ourselves.  <br><br>The truth is that this is not the message that we hear from the world today.  There is just so much self-worship, vanity, and greed in around us that many have lost sight of what is decent, true, just, and respectable.  <br><br>In the year 1912, a few days after the sinking of the Titanic, theologian Karl Barth delivered a fiery sermon in a church in Switzerland citing that the Titanic did not sink because of technological deficiency. He said it sank because of  human greed. <br><br>Barth argued that the captain of the ship, Edward Smith, was under an enormous pressure by the ship’s owners to break the speed record for the shortest time from England to the United States.  He had the financial interests of the owners and stockholders of the company, rather than the safety of his passengers.  <br><br>There were 2,200 people on board the Titanic, including passengers and crew. The ship had only enough life boats for 700 people, so about 1,500 people died that fateful night.  And so in the end, the so called “unsinkable” Titanic did not even last to finish its first and only journey. <br><br>The recent events in our nation involving high profile cases of alleged graft and corruption in the government call for deep and reverent reflection among God’s people today as to our own journey as a nation.  <br><br>If all these allegations are indeed true, we need to humbly come before the Lord and seek why a professing Christian nation would even find itself in this predicament. <br><br>Is this country that sick that people will sell their souls to the devil for wealth?  Is there no longer any fear of God left in the hearts of people today?  These questions may take a longer time to be answered, but certainly, we need to stop and begin to think of ways to shift the moral and spiritual gears of this country.  <br><br>What could ordinary citizens like you and me possibly do to create some kind of positive and godly impact in our destiny as a nation?  In as much as there are approaches that are communal and systemic, there are clearly some approaches that are personal and largely doable.  These are endeavors that we can do right inside our very homes and immediate social circles.  <br><br>Today, God is reminding us there is always more to life than worldly wealth.  Jesus Christ is allowing his voice to be heard once again, giving us at least three important things to consider: <br><br>1) Warning: Greed corrupts absolutely. We need to take a firm hold of our hearts making sure that our devoted allegiance is in Christ.  In the very words of Jesus, we need to guard ourselves from making setting up false gods in our hearts. God wants us to know that true satisfaction does not come from accumulating but in giving -- not in hoarding but in laying down our lives -- wholly to the Lord and to others. <br><br>2) Wisdom:   Our earthly life is fleeting and temporary. Surely, we can make projections and plans for our future, but anytime, the Lord can demand from us our lives.  We need to develop a perspective of what is eternally significant.  We need to be mindful that when we are down to our very last breath, the only question is whether we already made peace with God by accepting His Son Jesus Christ into our lives.  <br><br>3) Wonderful Assurance. Greed happens when we disengage our hearts from God’s purposes. Greed creeps in the very moment that our fear of God is taken over by our fear of not having enough for ourselves.  This is the path that leads to anyone’s downfall.   This is the spark that sets  an unquenchable fire that can destroy all that we have ever labored for.  <br><br>The Lord is calling us to listen closely to His voice one more time -- to have the humility of heart to heed His warning; to have the tenderness of spirit to believe in the wisdom He offers; and to hold on to His wonderful assurance that our final and ultimate security is in Christ who assures us time and again that if we truly make Him Master and Lord of our lives, and serve Him with utmost integrity in the spirit of genuine truth, justice and righteousness, there is absolutely no reason to be greedy or to scheme cunningly for our survival and security.  <br><br>The Lord will look after us.  He will certainly satisfy us beyond our expectation!  <br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

I was wuss. I went into the film knowing I could not possibly stand the sight (or even the suggestion) of physical torture James Franco had to endure in the role, even if it’s jazzed up in that Boyle way we’ve come to love in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach, 28 Days Later, Millions, Sunshine,</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Slumdog Millionaire</span>, films I’ve loved in varying degrees (although I always swear by Boyle’s earliest efforts more than anything else). Finally, I told myself: “You’ve watched the despicable <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hostel</span> by Eli Roth in one go, why couldn’t you do exactly the same for a much worthier effort?” That, plus the fact that I had to free up some space in my hard drive, finally made me sit through the entire film—and found it nothing short of amazing. One can read it as an adventure story, also a cautionary tale; a lot would come away from this film in that inspirational glow I usually come to suspect.<br><br>But here’s the deal: it is inspirational, despite its efforts to transcend the tendency. (Still, one can “accuse” Boyle for having a soft spot for such. Think of the kid in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Millions</span>.) The film has things to say about individualism, the connection between people, the things we must value above all things, the importance of a Swiss knife... But its engine lies in the emotional truism that sometimes life has a way of reminding us, often in the most heartbreaking (or arm-breaking?) way possible, about what is important. That comes to a clincher when Franco, as Ralston, finally comes to a clear understanding where this tragedy stands in the grand narrative of his life: “You know, I’ve been thinking. Everything is... just comes together. It’s me. I chose this. I chose all this. This rock... this rock has been waiting for me my entire life. It’s entire life, ever since it was a bit of meteorite a million, billion years ago. In space. It’s been waiting, to come here. Right, right here. I’ve been moving towards it my entire life. The minute I was born, every breath that I’ve taken, every action has been leading me to this crack on the out surface.” That felt real. I understood that. It made me think of my own metaphorical “rock” in my life, or perhaps the possibility that I still have to meet mine.<br><br>I ended the film knowing a certain urgency about the things I need to do, and things I need to put more focus on despite being drowned by so much insignificant noise and my own need to people my world with just me, me, me, divorced from the need of other people. I need to connect. Heck, I need to de-wussify.<br><br>        * * *<br>John Cameron Mitchell has never been one to shy away from the exploration of the rawness of our humanity. He steps into unbearable regions of ourselves with the rapt attention of a poet, and comes out of these explorations with precise, unflinching records of how we deal with all sorts of pain or loss. We see that in both <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hedwig and the Angry Inch</span> [2001], his directorial debut about a bitter transgendered rock singer with a botched sex-change operation, and later in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Shortbus</span> [2006], his controversial follow-up which is about a disparate group of New Yorkers grappling with sex, human connection, and sexuality, all done in splendidly pornographic details. But both films he did with an amazing command of cinematic poetry, and came off with such striking insights of what makes us human—our frailty, our courage, our savagery, our hopefulness, our incomprehensible methods of coping with pain.<br><br>He carries over that poetic take of the rawness of what makes us tick in his splendid, perfectly-tuned adaptation of David Lindsay-Abaire’s Tony-winning Broadway play. In <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Rabbit Hole</span> [2010], we follow Becka and Howie, a young couple dealing with grief, eight months after the death of their young son who was ran over by a drunken teenager. I say “poetic” because Mr. Mitchell does not slap us with the story of their pain in an unwanted avalanche of hysteria. Instead, he pulls us slowly into their dilemma with quietly staged scenes that add and add to the tension as the minutes go by, without us reeling from the horror of it all. Instead, we become engaged in the pain. Mr. Mitchell makes it familiar, even when it seems ultimately unbearable—and when Becka and Howie finally allow themselves to erupt, we welcome the outbursts as if they were our own. Note for example the scene when Becka rebukes her mother’s attempt to comfort her with a talk about God. She retorts: “God is a sadistic prick. ‘Worship me and I’ll treat you like shit.’ No wonder you like him, he’s like Dad.” A slap in the face, indeed—but we understand it, we know where it is coming from. It helps that all this pain is being channeled by Aaron Eckhart and Nicole Kidman—she in a bravura performance that may be the best of her career. It is a terrifying role that can go horribly wrong in less capable hands. But Ms. Kidman manages to make it her own and manages to make it so unflinchingly human that we come to identify well with her struggle, with her outbursts, with her strange ways of coping. Mr. Lindsay-Abaire, who also writes the screenplay, also gives Dianne Wiest’s mother a startling and moving monologue about the loss of a child somewhere in the middle of the film—and it feels and sounds true, the voice of a mother who has come to know that kind of pain, and has tamed it, if only a little. This is a film that must be watched.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>For centuries, even back to ancient Egypt, animals have been domesticated as household pets, and man has created special bonds with his domesticated animals, making them part of the family.  <BR><BR>Here in the Philippines, dogs are the most popular choice for household pets, partly for practical reasons, as guard dogs, but also for their loyalty and intelligence.<BR><BR>I rarely see cats as household pets here. Sadly, Filipino cats are mostly  stray, and they keep multiplying because there are no laws that require them to be neutered.  <BR><BR>In American cities, cats are as popular as dogs, especially for busy people who prefer cats’ low-maintenance lifestyle.  <BR><BR>When we came here almost two years ago, we brought our house cat with us, an orange tabby named Sebastian a.k.a. Snaggle-Tooth. It was a huge production, but it was worth it.  He had lived with us for 18 years at that point, and we couldn’t bear to leave him behind along with everything else. Now he is 20, having  far surpassed the normal life expectancy of house cats.  <BR><BR>In a bizarre way, I feel that he understands me when I talk to him.  Wishful thinking perhaps, but whether it’s true or not doesn’t matter because I know he understands the important things.<BR><BR> Pets bring joy and fun to our lives. There have been studies showing that they help us to maintain a positive outlook, and that they reduce stress and anxiety.  They provide us with unconditional acceptance, without judgment. They also bring cohesiveness to families.  <BR><BR>In recent years, the therapeutic usage of pets in the States has gained a lot of momentum not only in homes but also in health centers such as nursing homes.  Some research has shown that for people who suffer major illnesses, pets help them to actually live a little longer, and they tend to be less melancholy about their medical conditions.  Pets are great listeners, and except for parrots, they never talk back.  <BR><BR>Last year, I acquired a pregnant female goat named Sophie.  Since I know nothing about goats, I took her to some dear friends of mine, Royce and Luisa Ladnier, who run a goat farm in Balugo Sibulan called Hilltop Farm, for some R&R, since their farm is like a resort spa for goats.  (They sell beautiful Anglo-Nubian goats, primarily as breeding stock, many of them purebred.)  They took care of Sophie, and she gave birth to an adorable male goat, Sammy.  Originally destined for slaughter, Sammy was castrated as a matter of course (it greatly improves the quality of the meat and makes it less gamey).  <BR><BR>But then I realized that he is my pet, and so he will be spared from the butcher’s blade, becoming one of the very few goats who die of old age.  Being castrated, he is becoming quite philosophical, since his mind is not clouded by the constant chasing after does (females) that goats are famous for.   <BR><BR>Sophie has since given birth to female twins, Flora and Fauna.  It’s a lot of fun watching them playing with each other, and prancing around like reindeer. They come to me when I call their names, and they love to be petted, which is good for me, since it calms me down. <BR><BR>On the practical side, they are also “guard goats,” because they make noise whenever someone comes towards or through our gate.  I never thought I would be a goat-lover, but I am. <BR><BR>Pets bring out the nurturing instinct in us.  Our troubles seem to melt away, since we know that we could never explain them to these innocent little creatures.  I would encourage anyone who can to indulge in, and to indulge, a pet.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

The rice, which could reach a total of five 50-kg sacks, is donated to the university’s rice conservation advocacy called “Rice is Life.”<BR><BR>“This way, we do not only teach the children about the difficulty of early parenthood, but we also help the university,” she said. <BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Arguing one’s truth in a gentle and civil manner is the desirable norm of debate.<br><br>A medical doctor from Augusta, Georgia, USA, sent a <a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/amateur-boxing-is-safe-p1042-196.htm\">rejoinder</a> to a piece I wrote Nov. 10 where, as in several times in the past, I argued for the banning of boxing for reasons based on moral theology enunciated by the Vatican and on medical research articulated by the prestigious American Medical Association, the British Medical Association and other similar groups of experts. In 1991, 11 other national medical associations “confirmed their opposition to boxing, and expressed their concerns on its dangers, believing that ultimately it should cease to exist. These medical associations state that modern medical technology demonstrate beyond doubt that chronic brain damage is caused by the recurrent blows to the head experienced by all boxers, amateur and professional alike.” (Wikipedia).<br><br>For the information of Dr. Steven Brooks, the opinions I wrote about are not mine. I merely quoted those who expressed them. And I was the manager of the Amoranto Sports Complex in Quezon City in the mid-80s which had a boxing facility and a program for amateur boxing. Several boxers from that gym represented the Philippines as members of the national team. But that was before I took up the campaign against boxing.<br><br>All proponents of boxing anchor their arguments on statistics showing that other contact sports such as soccer, American football, rugby, motor racing, lacrosse and hockey, likewise pose risks of injury to the players. <br><br>Arguing on this premise completely misses the issues and concerns pointed out by medical experts and the Vatican, to wit: “Other types of sports, such as rugby or motor racing for example, carry some risk of injury and death, but none of these is pursued with the purpose of causing harm). <br><br>British Medical Association members have no intention to curtail such sports, but rather ensure that the health and safety and medical care are of the highest standards possible. <br><br>Similarly, the BMA does not seek a ban on proper martial arts sports such as karate and judo where avoidance of harm is intended, and the onus is on technical ability with wins scored on points. <br><br>Here are some more for the appreciation of Dr. Brooks: World Medical Association policy (2005) states that: “Boxing is a dangerous sport. Unlike most other sports, its basic intent is to produce bodily harm in the opponent Boxing can result in death and produces an alarming incidence of chronic brain injury. For this reason, WMA  recommends that boxing be banned”. <br><br>And this: “The President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Mukesh Haikerwal, (2006) stated: ‘International events based on the spirit of goodwill - such as Olympic and Commonwealth Games - are no place for interpersonal violence and injury” and that ‘it’s time to remove boxing from the sporting line-up’”. <br><br>The Vatican’s L’Osservatore Romano in 1986 editorialized: “Is it legitimate to continue to accept a sport whose fundamental aim is ‘to inflict corporal damage to the adversary’ as the World Medical Assembly held in Venice some months ago defined it? Physicians are in the majority of one mind in responding that it is neither legitimate nor moral. Nonetheless, boxing remains a violent sport, if not in the intention of the contestants at least in its form of expression. The ring is a stage of confrontation, said to be reliable and regulated but always brutal and sometimes savage…No sporting discipline nor any kind of ‘show’ can be accepted by a civic conscience if it endangers human life. Much worthier causes call for putting lives at stake.”<br><br>In short, Dr. Brooks, you can suit up your young boxers in metal like the knights of King Arthur’s Round Table, or full-body armor like RoboCop, and that will not make boxing ethically and morally acceptable for any human being, much more children, to pursue.<br><br>On your reference to my using the term “child abuse” to describe children boxing “is not only an absurd hyperbole aimed at stirring up passions…”, I think that you have so unkindly insulted an eminent colleague of yours, Dr. George Lundberg, the editor of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Journal of the American Medical Association</span> who with a great number of physicians, lawyers, sociologists and other experts contend that younger boxers face a greater risks—and this might legally constitute child abuse.<br><br>Wrote Dr. Lundberg: It is predictable damage, and it involves children. And if adults promote, for their own pleasure, children bashing each other, hurting each other, then this makes a pretty good case of child abuse”. <br><br>For the benefit of Dr. Brooks, I quote the following: “The British Medical Association has been an authority on boxing since 1982 and opposes both amateur and professional boxing and calls for a complete ban on boxing. As a first step, there should be a ban on children below the age of consent from boxing. Therefore the BMA is campaigning for a ban on boxing in those under the age of 16.”<br><br>I will continue to campaign against boxing, particularly children and youth boxing, where, as chairman of the Philippine Sports Commission and noting the national mania for Filipino boxers to win the first ever Olympic gold medal, I wrote an article with the title posing the question: “Brain-damaged youth for an Olympic gold?”<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

This was a major event in Dumaguete and Negros, so almost everyone in town came out for it.  <BR><BR>As you can see, it’s a very mixed crowd. Young and old, male and female, rich and poor- but mostly poor. The Governor was very popular with ordinary people. So this is  really a fair picture of  the general population.<BR><BR>But I think it’s also a picture of a possible future for the world.<BR><BR>The world is changing.  A century ago there were imperial countries: England, Europe, America, -and colonies: Everybody Else. After World War Two, the colonies became politically independent, but still subjects to their former rulers economically: First World and Third World. (What was the Second World was supposed to be?)<BR><BR>But now, 50 years later, things are changing again. Free trade, multi-culturalism, the rise of Asia as economic power, universal internet communication, is shifting the lines again. Money goes anywhere in the world where labor is cheap; people move anywhere in the world where there are available jobs. <BR><BR>Why pay an American woman the equivalent of 500 Pesos per hour to listen to customers complain about their washing machines? With cheap world call rates, you can pay a Filipina  500 Pesos per day to do the same thing.  Can’t find farm workers at reasonable rates in Germany? So hire Turkish guest workers at one third the price.<BR><BR>So now there are fewer jobs in Germany and America, slightly higher labor rates (for English speakers) in the Philippines, and a more mixed population worldwide: more Turks in Germany, more Sicilians in Switzerland, more Mexicans in  America, and Filipinos everywhere. <BR><BR>If this goes on, in another century the effect will be to mix all cultures and populations and level them off at the lowest rate. Western Pop culture will blenderize noisily with Asian family culture into a mixed, bittersweet fruit shake:  a situation, in the world of the future, very much like the situation in Dumaguete right now.<BR><BR>Look at this picture again, with a distant eye. What do you see? People of mixed ancestry- Spanish, Mexican, Chinese, Malay, American. Everybody wearing Western Clothes, mostly T-shirts.  And the street signs behind them are written in English.

   "body": "<BR><BR>One of the topics of conversation recently among practitioners of environmental advocacy has been how to convince local communities to set aside protected areas. One observation mentioned by some of the participants was that protection of any part of the environment requires time to take effect and is perceived as denying people of their livelihoods, especially in the Philippines, where poverty is rife. At first glance, this denial would not seem right under the principle that people’s needs must be given priority attention. So many people, including government officials, hesitate or even disagree, to set aside some areas of the environment for full protection from exploitation even for the purpose of allowing depleted biological resources to recover in the course of time.<BR><BR>But such an attitude is the main reason for the failure of the highly depleted resources of the country to recover and to provide useful products for people. The damage to the habitats has reached the tipping point and has become irreversible in many coastal areas, increasing the incidence and the extent of poverty in the country.  <BR><BR>The case of coral reefs reduced to rubble by dynamite blasting and use of cyanides is a prime example. Many coral reefs and their associated fisheries have not recovered since their initial destruction in the 1940s and 1950s and subsequent assaults from continuing fishing activities during the following decades. These reefs have remained to this day “desert areas” incapable of producing the marine biodiversity and the biomass of fish they once were contributing to the food economy of coastal communities. <BR><BR>A parallel situation is true of the tropical rainforest. The productivity shown in the many forest products (not counting the ecosystem services of this forest) that had sustained upland communities in the past has been lost with the massive destruction of the large species of trees that were logged to be converted into money and wealth benefiting only a few of our people. Many of these species may have gone extinct by this time.<BR><BR>Let me return to the main subject of this column, which is communication to convince people to protect the environment through the protected areas concept. First of all, this concept does not mean that people cannot make use of their resources. For marine protected areas, it means that only a smaller portion of a given marine area is fully protected from human use; to be exact about 20-30% of the total marine area. The rest of the marine area is set aside for fishing, using methods of capture that are not destructive to the habitat. So contrary to claims, the concept of marine protected area does not prohibit the legitimate use of fishery resources in the larger area reserved for fishing, and fishers continue to benefit from the fishing area. <BR><BR>It is important, however, that the concept must be explained very clearly to the stakeholders. The no-take zone is off limits to fishing because this area is reserved for fish to grow larger and to reproduce, biological activities that will increase their total biomass. This increased biomass will result in some of the fish spilling over to the adjacent fishing area, thus increasing the volume of fish available for fishers to catch. So the no-take zone actually increases the potential fish catch, benefiting the fishers over time. If explained this way, I do not think anybody in his right mind will object to the establishment of marine reserves or marine protected areas. There is one catch, however, and this is: The no-take zones must be totally protected from fishing for them to generate added biomass, and it is the responsibility of fishing communities to totally protect them from fishing. It is in this regard that fishing communities may fail to profit from marine reserves not because marine reserves are not effective but because they do not protect their no-fishing marine reserves, a behavior common in many coastal communities in the Philippines.<BR><BR>The acceptance of the marine reserve concept depends on how well the concept of protected areas is explained to the stakeholders. It is also a matter of who does the explanation. It is suggested that only people who have studied and have had practical experience in marine reserves be the ones to explain and to communicate to the people how protected areas work and how they benefit the people.  <BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

What was the last straw that broke the camel’s back, and drove millions of Filipinos to EDSA from Feb. 22 to 25, 1986?<br><br>First, they killed Ninoy Aquino at the tarmac of the Manila International Airport on Aug. 21, 1983. The assassination of Ninoy  emboldened millions, and they defied the dictator by lining up along Ninoy’s funeral cortege. <br><br>His death has stoked the feelings of freedom, which ignited the hearts of those who had previously ignored the excesses of the conjugal dictatorship.<br><br>From that time, covert acts of defiance like the “Mosquito Press” and the xerox publications were born. People started to get involved.<br><br>Second, poverty had blighted millions, with the dictator, his family, and his cronies living ostentatious lives, looking down on the hunger and misery of millions. Like the throes of the French Revolution, the hungry and the disposed were knocking on the place gates with their plows and shears,  unafraid and determined to be heard. But even the middle class and the well-heeled were so scandalized by the brazenness of the murder, disgusted at their helplessness, that they also came and stepped up to be counted.<br><br>Third, corruption was  rampant and prevalent, theirs was the “rule by law”  which favored the dictator, his family, and his cronies. <br><br>There was no justice,  as  the Legislative and Executive powers were exercised by one man, and the Judiciary was just a stamp pad for the  dictator, acting on his wishes.<br><br>Fourth,  the dictator was now haunted by his own crimes of silencing the opposition by arrests, detention, summary executions, and eventual ”salvaging”, suspicious of everyone, and intrigues were ripe amongst his own men. <br><br>There was inequality in the sharing of the spoils, thus, his own Defense Chief Enrile and his Vice Chief of Staff Ramos, with the help of Gregorio Honasan and the  Reformed Armed Forces Movement and the Young officers’ Union were suspected of plotting and  mounting a coup, and they were to be punished by death.<br><br>The call came first from Butz Aquino  of the August Twenty One Movement (ATOM),  then,  Cardinal Sin, to protect the lives of Enrile, Ramos and the officers who had broken away from Marcos. At that time, the people were saying: ”Never again!” <br><br>The rest is history, and sad to say, that as the events unfolded, we are back to square one especially on the issue of corruption. Do we leave it all up to P-Noy?<br><br>Each and everyone is called to do his/her patriotic duty to  be a good citizen, and for those in government, to do their duty.

I’d like to share two observations:<br><br>1) While most of the photographs he uses and his comments provide human interest, I have an uncomfortable feeling sometimes when the faces of his subjects are shown clearly and he writes, based on his imagination, what they may be thinking or are bothered about, etc.  I feel this is personally intrusive, especially since I assume, unless I am wrong, that the subjects may not have been aware that their pictures were being taken, and, much more, that these pictures would be published with his comments and seen and read by many.  I wonder how many would want their picture used this way in a small community like Dumaguete where people who know them might see and read what Mr. Stevenson has to say.<br><br>2) In his latest piece (<a href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/minority-report-p1025-97.htm\">MetroPost, Feb. 20</a>), Mr. Stevenson describes a skill that Filipino helpers possess, which is maintaining their unobtrusive presence even as they live with and work for families.  This can be a welcome trait, especially for expats who, like him, are not used to strangers living in the same house as they.<br><br>But his observation about <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">amo</span> (“master”) and helper relationships is not quite complete when he leaves out the fact that many helpers do become good friends of families they serve loyally and long.  Many become “almost family,” in fact, and their presence leads to the close intertwining of lives and richer (perhaps more complicated) household dynamics.  <br><br>Those who have lived longer in our culture will understand and appreciate this.

Ramos started his ‘summit initiatives’ (what pundits somewhat derogatively called later as his “governance by summitry”) with the People’s Economic Summit — a grand meeting between the legislative and executive branches of government, with the participation of civil society components, to hammer out a common agenda.  This resulted in the Social Pact for Empowered Economic Development — a wish-list of reforms and programs covering political, economic, social and other reforms.  It was a cumbersome program of governance and human development, but it did provide a comprehensive framework and direction toward poverty alleviation.<br><br>Realizing the difficulty of keeping track of the process of multilateral consultations and coordination by and between the executive (national government agencies), Congress (House of Representatives and Senate), and civil society (private business sector, formal/organized labor, non-governmental organizations or NGOs, as well as the basic sectors — peasant farmers, artisanal fisherfolk, indigenous peoples, urban poor, informal labor, migrant workers, persons with disabilities, elderly or senior citizens, women and children, students and youth, and victims of disasters and calamities — Ramos gave separate priority to the basic sectors’ agenda.  In June 1994 President Ramos convened the Social Reform Summit after a series of intensive talks between the basic sectors and their NGA counterparts to narrow down the former’s reform demands to a “doable” list, thus also institutionalizing the formal participation of civil society in governance on the basis of consensus building and the consultative collaboration process (or ‘critical cooperation’).  From then on until the end of the Ramos administration, the Social Reform Agenda or SRA was the counterpoint to the economic management focus of FVR’s Philippines 2000 governance program.<br><br>The SRA initiative continued the Cory administration’s Preferential Options for the Poor (“Pro-Poor” initiative) into the 1990s — it may be recalled that Cory’s “centerpiece program” was the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program .  The CARP and the other major reform issues and demands of the basic sectors were integrated into the SRA’s twin approaches of implementation: the Localization and Convergence strategies.  The first priority provinces where the SRA was intensively localized and where the convergence strategy (i.e., different NGAs converge to collaborate with local government units or LGUs and the basic sectors concerned in specific poor communities in addressing identified problems and reform issues) was implemented were the 20 poorest provinces, which were previously identified and selected by the Presidential Commission for Countryside Development.<br><br>While Negros Oriental was not one of those early priority provinces (“the first cut,” as former SRA Lead Convenor and Agrarian Reform Secretary Ernesto D. Garilao called it), eventually the SRA was broadened to encompass all provinces — primarily through the various NGA-basic sector assemblies on major reform issues, including agrarian reform; fisheries reforms; indigenous communities concerns; and others, as well as the implementation of the Minimum Basic Needs approach cross-cutting all the social sectors.  With a total of 557 barangays in Negros Oriental, it would be interesting to find out exactly how many have completed the MBNs in the province. At the end of the Ramos administration in 1998, the terminal report of the SRA’s implementation counted about 22,000 barangays of the country’s nearly 42,000 (at the time) with complete MBN surveys of households.<br><br>As director for policy reform, advocacy and sectoral affairs in the Secretariat of the Social Reform Council (the main precursor of the National Anti-Poverty Commission or NAPC), I oversaw the efforts to enact the 10 priority legislative measures of the basic sectors and the consensus-building process/’critical collaboration’ between basic sectors and NGAs that focused on a total of 134 reform commitments (five of which were later withdrawn).  On the accomplishment scorecard, 103 commitments (or 80 percent) were substantively met, as validated by the basic sectors at the end of the Ramos administration.  In terms of policy reforms, the 9th and 10th Congresses enacted a total of 79 economic reform laws; 65 political reform laws; and 85 social reform legislations — 60 of which were identified as SRA laws.  But the major social reform measures — the 10 SRA priority legislative bills — also scored an 80 percent accomplishment rate: eight were enacted into law. The Estrada administration then took over in the latter half of 1998, and we (the first NAPC staffers comprising three merged agencies — the SRC Secretariat, the PCCD, and the Presidential Commission to Fight Poverty or PCFP) were history... and it seems that since then, the SRA had become frozen in time. <br><br>Carlos Bueno<br><a href=\"mailto:caloy.bueno@gmail.com\">caloy.bueno@gmail.com</a><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Filipinos  wielded wisecracks as a rapier during the Japanese Occupation and under Marcos’  “New Society.”<br><br>A  visiting  European president once told  Marcos  that his hobby was collecting jokes about his administration. “And what   is Your Excellency’s hobby?, he asked. “I collect people who make jokes about me,” Marcos replied.<br><br>Dictatorships clone  similar abuses like  corruption, nepotism, suppression. Continents apart,  jokes reflect these cankers.<br><br>Imelda Marcos visits  a corrupt Asian minister’s opulent residence. “I know your official salary,” Imelda whispers. ”How can you afford all these?” The minister leads Imelda to the terrace and asks: “See that bridge between those two mountains?” Imelda peers and nods. “Twenty percent,” the minister explains. A year later, Imelda hosts the minister at her even more lavish residence. “I know your salary,” the minister whispers. “How can you afford all these, plus 1,080  pairs of shoes?” Imelda ushers her guest to the terrace. “See that bridge between those two mountains?” she inquires. The minister peers but  asks, “What bridge?” “One hundred percent,” Imelda replies.<br><br>That  resembles the yarn  of a  dying Mubarak.   “What would Egyptians do without me?” he frets.   “Don’t worry,” cronies  assure him. <br>“Egyptians are resilent  and, in local jargon,  could eat stones.” After a brief silence, Mubarak issues a presidential decree giving  his son  Alaa  a monopoly over  trade in stones. <br><br>“Can our vaunted Filipino sense of humor be harnessed to help us get through sickening corruption?” asked the late Jesuit Bishop Francisco Claver in his essay <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Of Laughter and Red Hot Coals</span>.<br><br>Claver drafted  the searing 1986 Catholic Bishops pastoral letter that denounced Marcos’s snap election as fraud-ridden. “Filipinos trade painful jokes for possible cathartic effect…Is it possible to creatively use humor as a means of purging graft?”<br><br> Corrupt militaries in dictatorships are the butt of jokes. <br><br>There was this captain who asked Ferdinand Marcos to promote him to general. “Answer one question, Captain,” the dictator said. “How much is two plus two?” Earlier, 53 colonels flunked that same question by answering: “Four.”<br><br>“Simple, Mr. President,” the captain replied. “Two plus two equals four -- and all for you, Sir.” “Raise your right hand, General,” a beaming Marcos ordered.<br><br>With  350,000 officers and men, and sophisticated weaponry, Egypt is the most militarily powerful country in the region. Egyptian Emergency Law makes it a crime to “insult the armed forces”. As the military takes over, will it tolerate  wisecracks?<br><br>Remember the Filipino farmer in the crowded bus?  “You’re in the army, right?”, he asked the man with the crew cut next to him  No, was the reply. Ten kilometers later, the farmer  inquired: “In the navy?”, Again, no. “In the National Police?”, he pressed 10 kilometers later. Irritated, the man snapped: “No!”  “Then, get off  my foot!” the farmer yelled.<br><br>“In tyranny, political jokes are acts of defiance,” notes the book <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">No Laughing Matter</span>. And “Christ himself constantly used ridicule against his enemies among the Pharisees of his time,” noted Bishop Claver.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>With only five taxicabs around, you’d be lucky to catch one in Dumaguete City.  Here, people go places in a tricycle while motorcycles rule the road. For a city measuring 35 square kilometers, this small place, by any standard, still grinds to a halt at noontime to allow everyone to go home for lunch.{{more}}<br><br>“I didn’t believe it at first when they said that in Dumaguete, everything is 10 minutes away. But I found out for myself that it’s true,” said Leonel Joseph “LJ” Lising, senior operations manager of SPI CRM, a business process outsourcing company that set up its business here in 2009.  “When they say a place is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">malayo</span>, it’s actually near. A ten-minute drive could take you to the next town,” this young executive from Manila said.<br><br>Dumaguete’s smallness is its own charm. On a typical afternoon, one can find several of its European immigrants hobble towards their favorite watering hole among the many establishments that dot the Rizal boulevard, facing the Dumaguete bay and have their favorite fix while watching the world go by.<br><br>Small wonder why not a few of SPI’s foreign clients have been heard to ask, “Why Dumaguete? There are only 150,000 people there,” recalled Suzanne Lu-Bascara, SPI Global associate director.<br><br>The anxiety is not totally misplaced. SPI Global, after all, is a major player in the BPO industry in the country, with 11,000 employees, not to mention some 3000 more in 24 locations in the United States, Europe, India and Vietnam.<br><br>Its Dumaguete operation alone expanded from 313 full time employees in October 2009 to 1100 employees in January 2011. “We’re now the biggest private employer in Negros Oriental doing both voice and non-voice services,” Bascara said.<br><br>She said the company makes it a point to bring their foreign clients over to Dumaguete to see the place. “They see that although the City is small, there is a steady manpower pool generated by the four universities and colleges here which produce about 5,000 graduates each year, in contrast to the 500,000 graduates throughout the country,” she said.<br><br>Also called a University Town, Dumaguete is home to Silliman University, founded by American missionaries in 1901. The nuns from the order of St. Paul de Chartres arrived in Dumaguete’s shores in 1904 to establish the first campus of St. Paul University in the Philippines. In 1949, a young teacher named Vicente G. Sinco established what is now the non-sectarian Foundation University, the first Filipino University. The Negros Oriental State University was founded in 2004.<br><br>For Lising, these universities and seven other colleges play an important part in giving them quality employees. “We get nine or 10 walk-ins every day and we have a success rate of 30-40 percent. In contrast, we may get more applicants in Manila but the success rate is only 10 percent,” he said.<br><br>It is when the foreign clients realize this that they know they made the right choice by choosing SPI Global, Bascara said.<br><br>Not only do the educational institutions provide the 4000 workers in Dumaguete’s BPO industries today but they have also formed an Information Communication Technology Council to harmonize the skills of their graduates with the demand of the competitive BPO industry.<br><br>One of the challenges of the ICT Council, headed by Randy Bandiola of Colegio de Sta. Catalina de Alejandria, is to convince the graduates to stay in Dumaguete. There are more jobs for qualified applicants even as BPOs are estimated to pump in no less than P34 million a month into the economy of Dumaguete City and Negros Oriental in salaries alone.<br><br>And that’s not counting the side businesses that the employees support. “Near our site, some houses have been renovated to boarding houses,” Lising said. Several restaurants have also sprouted nearby.<br><br>Lising said that while he gets to go home to Manila once a month, he enjoys staying in Dumaguete. “It’s cheaper to be in Dumaguete than in Manila. In Manila, a round trip from one’s house to the office could easily cost P50. Here, it’s P20. So call center agents here have higher take home pay,” he said.<br><br>His sentiments are also shared by some support members from Manila and Iloilo, who have decided to make Dumaguete their permanent home.<br><br>Another thing Lising likes about Dumaguete is that employees don’t skip work even though they partied the night before.  “No wonder Dumaguete had been ranked 10th on the list of Next Wave Cities in the Philippines last year,” he said.<br><br>SPI Global started operations in Dumaguete with the merger of two companies—E-PLDT Ventus and SPI Technologies in October 2009. Their non-voice services include publishing and copy editing while they have a call center which handles mostly the needs of Smart Communications, Inc, their sister company.<br><br>Bascara said they are proud of the quality of their work, which won them the honor of being named as the number one outsourcing company in the world in 2009, by the Black Book of Outsourcing. This was based on a poll of about 650 respondents from the global publishing community.<br><br>May Dizon, SPI Global director for external affairs and corporate communications, said that their company will soon venture into the more lucrative KPO (Knowledge Process Outsourcing) market, which will deal with content solutions, health care and client relationship management.<br><br>For starters, Dumaguete will be the site of SPI Global’s pioneering venture in the Billing and Cycle Revenue Management.<br><br>“Dumaguete is a showcase,” Dizon said. “We want the others to know that in Dumaguete, we found a good place to grow and expand.”  <br><br><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/SPI-2.jpg\"><br><br>A typical day at the SPI Global facility in Dumaguete City.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The first recipient was the municipality of Dauin.  The shipment of seven balikbayan boxes was distributed among four elementary schools, three high schools, and a Special Education high school. <BR><BR>Five  pre-schools were the recipient of toys.  This could not have been possible without the leadership of Manny Abellon, and supported by all officers and members.  <BR><BR>On the pipeline is sending to Negros Oriental some medical supplies.<BR><BR>What started as a simple get together by some Negrenses some 20 years ago has grown into a membership of over a hundred Negrenses.<BR><BR>To jumpstart its 20th anniversary this year, a summer picnic has been scheduled for June 11 at the Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area in Irwindale, CA.

Roel R. Degamo</span><br></div><br><br>        <br>Mr. Presiding Of&#64257;cer;  Honorable members of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan; our City and Municipal Mayors; guests from the academe; our friends and partners from the different non- government organizations; representatives from the religious and business sectors; heads of line agencies; my colleagues in government, ladies and gentlemen.{{more}} <br><br>At the outset, may I thank everyone, most especially the members of  Sangguniang Panlalawigan led by Vice Gov. Apolinario A. Arnaiz Jr.,  for giving me this opportunity  to present to you our plans and programs  during the remaining two and a half  years of our term.  <br><br>A little over a month ago and by the grace of God,  I was sworn in as your Governor, and today, I come before you  to present our Program of Government as mandated under Section  465 (iii)  of Republic Act 7160. As I approach this job, I start with a simple promise  to all of you: I will always listen. I will always seek your cooperation, and a thoughtful commitment to meaningful solutions. We are here to solve problems. We all have jobs to do. You have Districts to represent and constituents who want their voices heard and I respect that. <br><br>As leaders of this Province, we should be able to provide  our people more and better opportunities to advance their personal well being, more particularly  in the areas of  Health, Education and Livelihood Programs. <br>                                                                                                                                   <br>While my predecessors have efficiently managed the Province exceptionally well, I know as well as everyone else that we still have a lot of things to do.  Given the very limited period before us, it is important  for us to work hard and work fast. More importantly, we should HELP each other to achieve our development objective which is: â€œto advance further the level of comfort of our constituents.â€ <br><br>Ladies and gentlemen, we have an agenda for progress that needs our urgent attention. It is spelled H-E-L-P.  H stands for Health, E for Education, L and P for Livelihood Programs and Projects.  <br><br>It is easier for us to attain our goals if we HELP each other  and work harder.  Work, as they say  in Spanish, is <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">degamo</span>.  Therefore, to pick up from the favorite catchwords of my predecessors: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Basta NegOr: Kasaligan!</span> And may I add <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">MagDegamo ta!</span> May I repeat, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Basta NegOr: Kasaligan! MagDegamo ta! </span><br><br>These are the things we need to do:  <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ON HEALTH</span><br></div><br><br>        I believe there can be no real development if our people are not healthy.  We need to improve on  what we have, and provide  our people with the necessary facilities for their well-being.  <br><br>First,  we will work  for the completion of the four-storey hospital Central Block behind the main hospital building, and the multi- storey Ob-Gyne building to decongest the main hospital, and along with this, the Community Emergency Maternal Obstetrics Neonatal Care (CEMONC) for Bayawan City  and  Guihulngan City -- all of which are funded by the Department of Health. I intend to &#64257;nish these  projects  before my term ends in 2013. <br><br>The Central Block project is now on going. I have just been informed that the bidding procedure for these buildings have just been completed by the Bids and Awards Committee. And so I hope we can start construction within the year. <br><br>Second, we will strengthen our District Hospitals by providing them with the adequate and necessary support services to make them  more accessible to our people and better equipped to handle quality health care.   <br><br>Initially,  we have added   seven new doctors to the existing personnel complement who will soon be farmed out to these facilities. This development will not deter us from inviting more doctors to our residency training program. <br><br>Third,  and corollary to the second, we will establish a Mobile Surgical Team to perform minor surgeries in the different District Hospitals of the Province,  more particularly for indigent patients who may need to undergo minor surgical procedures.  This is an expanded approach  to the concept of  bringing medical services at the doorstep of our people through Medical Missions. At this point, I direct Dr. Felix Sy,  our chief of hospital, to immediately form the members of the team for this purpose; <br><br>Fourth, we will expand the coverage and services  of the Provincial Health Insurance of Negros Oriental to include PHINO members  who wish to undergo treatment in private hospitals. <br><br>Fifth, we will continue granting scholarships to students who wish to pursue a degree in Medicine at the Silliman University Medicine School, provided they will serve the required number of years in our own hospitals. For the record, we have produced and employed seven of our scholars. <br><br>Sixth, we will establish a partnership with Silliman University for the possible conversion of the Marina Clinic located in the municipality of Dauin into another Community Primary Hospital.  This will greatly enhance and improve the delivery of primary health care services to our people in that part of the Province.  <br><br>Seventh, we will complete the construction of the Community Primary Hospital in Dawis, Bayawan City -- the seventh of its kind in the whole Province; and <br><br>Eighth, we will form a partnership with private hospitals in Dumaguete to strengthen the referral system between and among private and public doctors, and to maximize the potential of all the modern and state-of-the-art laboratory and diagnostic equipment acquired by our Negros Oriental Hospital System. <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ON  EDUCATION </span><br></div><br><br>        I adhere to one of the most familiar quotations of Dr. Jose Rizal which says:  â€œThe youth is the hope of the fatherland.â€ As leaders, it is our sublime duty to ensure that every child is given access to education. Thus: <br><br>1) We will continue with the implementation of the school building program initiated by the late Gov. Dodo Macias, dubbed <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Basta NegOr-Education 104</span> -- which put up a total of 140 classrooms instead of 104 as its tagline says, and committed the Department of Education to increase the teacher-student complement in the Province by 100 more.  DepEd still has to &#64257;ll in the remaining 40 teacher items  of its commitment.  We will pursue this commitment  of DepEd so as not to deprive our schoolchildren of quality education.  <br><br>2. We will continue giving college scholarships to  poor but deserving students who graduated as valedictorians and salutatorians in high school;  <br><br>3. We will take care of the health of our school children by supporting the Essential Health Care Package program of the DepEd. The EHCP is actually a kit containing items for hand washing and tooth brushing, in effect  teaching our children proper hygiene.  I am pleased to note  that the Sangguniang Panlalawigan is sponsoring an ordinance to this effect through Board Member Peve O. Ligan. <br><br>4. We will continue to provide funds for teacher aides under the Educator-Co-Mentor Program.  <br><br>We will also review the Negros Oriental Sports Development Program, and possibly integrate the same with the DepEd curriculum to  make it  more responsive to the physical and mental development  of schoolchildren. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ON LIVELIHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS/PROJECTS </span><br></div><br><br>        In my travels all over the Province during my Board Member days, and when I became Vice Governor, and now as your Governor, I have seen our vast natural resources, our great natural attractions, met our constituency, listened to them, and saw the great potential for our Province and people to grow beyond what it could be.   <br><br> And how do we do this? Money and jobs go with tourism.  Thus: <br><br>1. We will continue to promote eco-tourism as a major industry in the Province, along with the development of our tourism assets like Tambobo Bay in barangay Bonbonon, Siaton. <br> <br>For the information of everybody, we have allocated almost P20 million this year for the development of the Provinceâ€™s various tourism sites.   And I am also happy to note there is an Ordinance passed by this August Body which would pave the way for the development of Tambobo Bay.  <br><br>2. We will review the functions of our two skills training centers -- the Provincial Integrated Skills & Technology Center, and the Technology & Livelihood Development Center, and make technology transfer more within the reach of our people,  especially for those coming from far-&#64258;ung places. <br><br>3. We will continue to tap the private sector, and make them our partners in providing livelihood opportunities to our people. It should be noted that the Provincial government during the time of then Governor Macias  entered into an agreement with different &#64257;nancial institutions and allocated some P3 million as counterpart for  the Coopreneurship Surety Fund Program. This serves as equity for small-and-medium scale entrepreneurs in the Province to access to formal sources of &#64257;nancing without a collateral. <br><br>4. We will maintain our relationships with the private sector through the Negros Oriental Investment Promotion Center,  the Negros Oriental Business Development Foundation, and the Negros Oriental Chamber of Commerce & Industry as partners in bringing  more investments to the Province.  The more investments, the more jobs generated. <br><br>5. With your cooperation, we will push  for the passage of two major ordinances this year: the Revenue Code of Negros Oriental which is vital and necessary in increasing our revenues;  and the creation of the Economic Enterprise Of&#64257;ce which will put under one roof all the income-generating facilities of the Provincial government such as the Lamberto Macias Sports & Cultural Center, the rubberized track oval at the Perdices Stadium, the Lorenzo G. Teves Aqua Center, the mini-gym, the Negros Oriental Hotel & Convention Center, among others; we will also give priority to the completion of the Perdices Coliseum Hotel & Restaurant Complex to generate employment and added income for the Provincial government.  <br> <br>6. Along with H.E.L.P., we are also looking at establishing  an Engineering Mobile Unit for every Legislative District in the Province. These mobile units will be responsible for  the maintenance and improvement of roads  and other similar structures in their respective Districts.   We intend to establish these by the start of the third quarter of this year. <br><br>7. Moreover, we will form partnerships with the Philippine Army Engineering Brigade to help improve our road network in the hinterlands.  This is one way of reducing  costs, while addressing also other concerns related to peace and order. <br><br>In <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Agricultural Development,</span>  we will continue  the vision of my predecessors to allocate at least 10 percent of the farm lands in the Province to purely organic farming. This is in keeping with our position to adopt eco-friendly technologies whilst working for greater productivity.  <br><br>We will make operational the Kasaligan Transport Service.  At this point, I direct our Provincial Agriculturist Mr. Gregorio Paltingca to look into this aspect. <br><br>In addition, we will speed up development in the different communities of the Province by creating the Governorâ€™s United Assistance Rural Development or GUARD under Engr. Dominador Dumalag Jr. <br><br>Furthermore,  we will strengthen the research and development component in the agricultural and aquaculture sectors  to improve the yield of our high-valued fruits and vegetables, including rice, corn and upland &#64257;shery.<br>  <br>On <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Environmental Concerns</span>,  we will push for the adoption of the  climate change adaptation and mitigation plan which includes integrated water resources management, wildlife conservation and biodiversity, prepared by the different LGUs.  I am directing Mrs. Mercy Teves,  chief of our Environment & Natural Resources Division,  to ensure this will be carried out in the light of climatic changes that have already wrought havoc in  lives and properties in the Province. <br><br>Corollary to this, we will reinforce the existing crop of our SaRNegOr, our Search and Rescue team, so we could have stand- by teams to respond to emergencies in every city and municipality of the Province. This  forms part  of our Disaster Risk Reduction Management Plan.  I direct Mr. Angelo Tiongson, our Disaster Risk Management of&#64257;cer, to look into this aspect. We will strengthen our regulatory function on  the utilization of the  Provinceâ€™s natural resources,  such as sand and gravel, and other valuable minerals, by putting in trust the proceeds collected from users so that this can be plowed back for the efficient and effective implementation of regulatory laws. <br><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">ON HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT </span><br></div><br><br>        Hereâ€™s good news for all the members  of the Provincial Government! In keeping with our verbal request for every employee to render â€œService with a Smileâ€,  we are considering the granting of incentives and awards  to our employees for exemplary performance in their line of work under the Program on Awards & Incentives for Service Excellence or PRAISE.  This should serve as a motivating factor for everyone in the organization to do good and look good.  In short,  to be more productive and become Model Civil Servants.   At this point,  I am directing Mrs. Daisy Vamenta, our Human Resource Management of&#64257;cer,  to immediately convene a Committee so that the mechanics of this particular award can be drafted.  As to whether we will give cash or incentives in kind, I will leave that to the Committee. <br><br>Moreover, we will also pursue the aborted plan of the late Gov. Tuting Perdices to give recognition to ordinary folks who have made outstanding accomplishments in their communities.  This is in line with the Outstanding Oriental Negrense Award. <br><br>Moreover, we will continue to promote and advance the rights of our women and children, the differently-abled,  and the elderly, in cooperation with UNICEF. Further, we will continue providing assistance  to individuals in crisis situations. <br><br>On <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Development Administration</span>, we will make use of the wonders of modern  technology by possibly adopting the so-called paperless transaction system. We will work on making  Negros Oriental a model  on this, considering that we have installed the Fund Management Information System,  and  the Hospital Information System.  We are now starting to establish our Personnel Information System. <br><br>Furthermore,  we will make representation for Negros Oriental to be the home of the National iTAX Headquarters. The late Governor Macias had laid the foundation for this, in cooperation with the German Technical Cooperation Agency. For information, several local government units in the country have sent their staff to train here in the Province for the iTax  Program.  <br><br>Finally, to be more transparent, we will make use of new technology by making the Provincial government and the Governor accessible through text. The Project  called, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">â€œI-text Mo kang Degamoâ€</span> will receive and answer queries and feedback on governance from the citizens. We have assigned a dedicated cellphone for this purpose, and we expect the public  to make use of this technology. <br><br>My friends,  ladies and gentlemen, our list of things to be done could go on and on. But for the meantime, we are giving more focus on the â€œdoablesâ€ -- the things we need to do and hope to accomplish in the last two and a half years of our term.  <br><br>We thank the Lord Almighty for giving us the gift of public service.  And no matter how big the challenges  may come our way,  we cannot waver or falter,  knowing that God is with us. I ask the members of this august body, the academe, our NGO partners and  friends from the private sector,  our local of&#64257;cials and colleagues in government service, and most of all, the  people of this Province, to join and HELP us advance the welfare of our people.  <br><br>Letâ€™s get moving.  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sa probinsya, Mag-Degamo ta!</span>  Let us work as a team,  because together, we can make a difference.<br><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Participants came from as far as Bais City and Bacong town, and also attracted foreign expats now residing in Dumagute City.

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>Healing was one of the three core ministries of the Christ alongside the ministry of preaching and the ministry of teaching.    Every person who is engaged in the healing profession today should seriously consider that it was Christ himself who demonstrated through his very life what it meant to genuinely care for others.  <br><br>Christ taught that we cannot genuinely care for others if our hearts are focused on self-ambition or financial gain.  We cannot be effective channels of healing if we view caring for others as a mere job and not a calling.  We cannot lead others to true wholeness unless we ourselves deeply understand that it is only the Lord who has the power to heal.  <br><br>I took up nursing 1987 primarily because of the encouragement of my parents and relatives.  At the time I entered college, there were at least four female nurses in both my father and mother side who were based in the United States.  All of them were financially stable and were regular sources of Christmas gifts mostly chocolates, canned goods, bed sheets and imported towels.  We would receive pictures from them posing in front of the Christmas tree inside their apartments or in front of their cars wearing thick snow jackets in the winter time.  It did not take long for me to understand that taking up nursing was a stepping stone to a better and more comfortable life.  Being the eldest of the three daughters of a public school teacher and a private practicing architect, I desired to see greater financial freedom for my family.  Although I dreamt of becoming teacher or a radio broadcaster, taking up nursing was not a totally bad idea.  After all, my grandmother was just so eager to support me financially when she learned I was going to be a future nurse, and that I would be living in the States someday. <br><br>Nursing school was very tough in every aspect imaginable.  More than the academic demands of the course was the physical exhaustion and the emotional energy that were required to deal with all kinds of people in the classroom, the community and the clinical setting. Although I was  a few points shy of cum laude,  our university gave me recognition for my writing, leadership and speaking skills.  I was also one of those who received a special recognition for a complete attendance in the clinical area from 1st year to 4th year (no kidding!). By the God’s grace of the Lord there were four of us in our batch who landed 18th place during that year’s board exams.  In a few months, I was hired at the Makati Medical Center where I worked for nearly three years.  <br><br>My clinical nursing experience was very fulfilling and rewarding.  Aside from the advancement I gained in the area of patient care, there crucial issues in life that I began to understand more. I saw up close that even the most moneyed people have no power to extend their life even just for one more day the moment God calls them home.  I also learned that it requires moral courage to be a Christian nurse since there were many temptations to sacrifice excellent and quality care when no one is watching.  I was promoted to assistant head nurse after less than two years and as planned, I was on my way to fulfilling my American dream. But one unexpected phone call changed everything.  I was informed that I was being considered to occupy a full time position in our church where I managed to remain quite active from my high school days until my early working days.  Of course I refused!  No way!  This was not my plan.  Deep in my heart though, I knew I had given a wrong answer. I was given more time to pray and consider the invitation.  It was a overwhelmed.  I was hearing a call I was too frightened to answer. I was at the verge of fulfilling my dreams, but here was a voice calling me to let go, to obey and to trust completely.  My mother cried when I told her of my decision to accept the offer.  My father was too angry and too bitter to even speak to me when he heard what happened. When he finally broke his silence, his first words were, “You are such a disappointment.”   My relatives were in shock.  My nursing superiors thought I was making an unnecessary mistake.  I began full time ministry work in January 1995 in the area of missions and discipleship.<br><br>At first I thought I had abandoned the nursing profession but as time passed God made me realize that I actually even went deeper into it.  More and more, I saw the connection between the body and the spirit - - - the symptoms that manifest physically and the deep wounds that can only be healed spiritually by Christ.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Purpose –</span> You, my fellow nurses, are Christ’s hands and feet.  That is what gives the greatest dignity to what we do.  Through our humble efforts, Christ is bringing hope, healing and help to a world full of sickness and pain.  Let us not be tempted to trivialize or de-value our precious calling. Christ himself has warned us that there is more to life than worldly wealth or achievement.  It is lonely at the top when we are alone. Our true contentment will never come from money but from serving Christ through the people we care for.  <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Perseverance</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> –</span> Caring for others is not easy or convenient.  Unlike other professions that deal with numbers and machines, we deal with people- with all their complex issues, emotional baggage and overwhelming personal crises.   When we are at the verge of quitting, let us remember that the One who paved the way for us to care for others gave his very own life.  Any sacrifice we do is nothing compared to what Christ has done for us.  It is a great honor to care for others.  It is a privilege to share in the work that Christ has done and continues to do.   <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Power of Christ</span><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"> –</span> As nurses, we have often seen many people take their last and final breaths.  Those gripping moments are precious and unforgettable.  They have a way of reminding us that our most noble efforts are inadequate at times. Our most sincere and competent interventions can only go as far as God will allow.  Certainly, w do our best, but we leave God the rest.  <br><br>It’s been 15 years now.  My father and I have reconciled.  He never stopped loving me and believing in me after all.  I only needed to give him time to understand, to process and to heal.   God’s interruptions never damage or cause harm.  They bring greater fulfillment in all we do.  They bring greater sense and meaning to every effort we exert by the grace of the Lord.<br><br> Take heart, my fellow nurses for there is so much work to be done!  Let us honor our true purpose.  Let us always persevere.  We are but vessels.  It is Christ’s power that heals.  It is his love that makes us whole.  So, let us take delight in our precious calling!  Let us continue to care, to love, to give ourselves and to believe in what the Lord can do in us and through us. <br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

But that’s exactly what you will find in David O. Russell’s boxing drama <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Fighter</span> [2010]. This is not to begrudge the talent of Mark Wahlberg who has shown us before that he has the acting chops to carry a picture. He was gloriously cocky in Paul Thomas Anderson’s porn epic <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Boogie Nights</span> [1997], and scintillatingly angry in Martin Scorsese’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Departed</span> [2006]. His boxer (named Mickey) in Russell’s film is of a placid sort, but it provides the necessary blank slate for his character: a man whose life is in control of others around him. And the “others” of course are tornados: there’s Amy Adam’s feisty girlfriend, Christian Bale’s crackhead coach brother, and most of all, Melissa Leo’s monstrously controlling mother whose acridity is symbolized by the stiff immovability of her hairdo.<br><br>They all want to have the biggest say in Mickey’s career choices, and for so long he has followed the harebrained maneuverings of his mother who acts as his manager, and suffers the shenanigans of his unprofessional brother—who is a boxing genius, a one-time local legend (he reputedly once TKO’d Sugar Ray Leonard), if only he could get away from crack. Disasters follow one after the other, until he gets a forced enlightenment, courtesy of a girl who calls a spade a spade, and sees that Mickey’s greatest liability as a boxer is his toxic family. And so now this is the real boxing story of the film: not the fights in the ring, although that’s fairly represented, but in the arduous decision of our indecisive hero—who do you follow? your family who seems blindly bent on your ruin? or other people?<br><br>Mr. Bale is a force to be reckoned with in this film, and it might as well be his as a lead role and not Mr. Wahlberg’s. His Dicky, in fact, is a co-lead more than anything else. He does his usual physical stunt of thinning himself for a role again—a yo-yo-ing weight manipulation he has already done numerous times, such as in Brad Anderson’s chilling <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Machinist</span> [2004], Mary Harron’s murderous 80s satire <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">American Psycho</span> [2000], Werner Herzog’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Rescue Dawn</span> [2006], as well as in Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies. Ms. Adams turns in a performance that defy with delicious wildness the other landmark roles in her resume—a Disney princess, a doubting nun, a food blogger, a Southern chatterbug. But it is Ms. Leo’s mother with whom the screen almost staggers with such malevolent power. She is the undisputed queen of a family that is scary in that loutish, white-trash kind of way. Her monster mom makes me shiver, because I know people just like her: people who are strangely invested in cultivating the failure of people who love them. I cringed in every scene that she was in. To have that kind of screen presence, you had to hand it to Ms. Leo’s acting prowess, last glimpsed in Courtney Hunt’s powerful <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Frozen River</span> [2008], for which she was nominated for Best Actress in the Oscars. But how we loath her character. And how wonderful that is.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">      * * *<br></div><br><br>        Here is a dramedy of such compelling believability and heart, spurred by some of the greatest, most nuanced performances by any Hollywood actor last year. I came away from its screening in the University of Iowa campus with that glowing affirmation that I have just seen greatness -- and it is just a little bit too bad that not a lot of people would be watching it, given its premise. The premise is this: a lesbian couple and their two teenage children, both inseminated from the same sperm donor, deal with the upheaval of his abrupt arrival into their lives. The complications and the drama I would not elaborate in this space, but the minutae of their dilemma and the ways with which they try to seek an impasse are handled with such delicate fluency by director Cholodenko, who clearly knows what she wants to do with this story and how to frame it. There is not one false note in this film, and the necessary chemistry of its stars—including the slowly tattering connection between Annette Bening and Julianne Moore who play the couple—are spot-on and subtle. Mark Ruffalo pulls off his role as the gentle, if bumbling, interloper with such fine balance (he makes sloppy decisions, but we can’t hate him). He does this with such convincing thoroughness that I know he will be overlooked once again in the race for acting awards this year. Why? His acting is so good, he disappears and just becomes. And Oscar, of course, seems to always bet on the showy. (Think Christian Bale in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Fighter</span> and Natalie Portman in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Black Swan</span>.)<br><br>Ms. Moore is given a devastating monologue in the end that gives us goosebumps as she tallies the difficulties of love and marriage, but it is Ms. Bening who steals the movie. She steals it in a peculiar way, because while we are watching the film, she seems to come and go in stealth. And yet, when the movie ends, it is her performance you remember the most. Take note of the dinner scene, where she lets her obsessive-compulsive self go with a Joni Mitchell song.<br><br>Take note of the sequence right after that -- no words, just silence, and just a close-up of her face as she processes a terrible discovery. Those few minutes of just her face is a masterclass in acting. She deserves an Oscar for that scene alone.<br><br>And yet I seem to paint the entire film as something quite serious. It is. But it is also a very, very funny film, a riot in fact. And it is that perfect juggling act between comedy and drama that makes this film feel true and feel emotionally resonant—the way <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Social Network</span> probably does not do, even with all its technical flourish. This is a film to love, especially for what it says about modern families. And especially for the performances in it that are more than all right, they’re golden.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

And as if all of that were not difficult enough, Jesus concludes by saying, “Be perfect.”  Did you feel that following Jesus is next to impossible?  <br><br>When I was in the seminary, we were told that our religion should be one that helps us.  Having been a pastor for more than 40 years,  I have learned the hard lesson that there is often a difference between what is supposed to be, and what is.<br><br>Thus, there are many people who experience religion as a burden, especially when they read this passage.  If they were honest, they would say, “This Jesus is just giving us more burden to carry!”  Of course, we know this is not the way it is supposed to be.  <br><br>But for many people, religion for them involves rules, regulations, obligations, responsibilities.  And God is experienced as a stern taskmaster. <br><br>I hope I’m wrong, but I fear that the prevalent image of the Christian gospel for many goes something like this: God wants us all to be good.  And the Bible is there to show us how to be good.  We are to go to worship, read the Bible, say our prayers, give one-tenth of our income, love our enemies, serve our neighbors, give to those in need, go the second mile, turn the other cheek, and on and on it goes.  <br><br>And we are to do all of those things, and more, smiling all the while, while refraining from lying, cheating, stealing, swearing, and being unkind to children, pets, and mothers-in-law!  <br><br>I get tired just thinking about it all!  It is a heavy weight to carry!  And watch out if we make a mistake!  God watches our every move and records our behavior in a grade book.  We receive a gold star for every good deed we do, and a black mark for every bad deed.  When we die, God adds up the gold stars and black marks.  If we have more gold stars than black marks, we go to heaven.  If we have more black marks than gold stars, then we go to hell.<br><br>With that picture of the Christian life in mind, I can understand why a great many people do not want any part of it.  I can understand the response one man made when a friend said to him one day, “Wouldn’t you like to be a Christian?” He answered, “No, thanks.  I have enough trouble as it is!”  <br><br>If we are caught up in a narrow, legalistic world in which the dominant word we hear is “You ought, you should, you must,” then that is a heavy load to carry, and life is probably experienced as a gray, joyless, duty-filled burden.<br><br>But we know that the word, “gospel” means “good news”. Where is the good news in that?  <br><br>Let me share with you a different perspective that will help us understand this passage.  If we read the Bible, I believe that the emphasis is not primarily about what God demands; the emphasis is on what God gives.  <br><br>God gives us love in Jesus.  Once we receive that, trust that, and begin to live our lives according to the guidance and strength of that, then we begin to be able to live lives that Jesus wants us to live.  <br><br>In other words, God shapes our lives not by passing down a lot of rules from “out there,” beyond yonder, but by loving us and empowering us from “in here” within ourselves.  <br><br>If you read the gospels, they tell us that Jesus wants us to have all the best that life affords, including life in this world.  Remember Jesus saying, “I have come that you may have life, and have it abundantly.”  <br><br>The emphasis is not on demands.  The emphasis is upon gifts—those gifts God gives us to ease our burden.  <br><br>This is not to say that there are no demands – there are.  There is a cost to discipleship, and the cost is high.  In fact, it may demand for your life.  It may break relationships.  It does not mean that we tolerate some high-ranking officials of the military stealing from the government because of their greed at the sacrifice of the ill-equipped soldiers who are in the war zones.  It does not mean we just keep quiet when people abuse their power.  And for future journalists as well as the present, it can mean using the media to present the truth, even if sometimes it may be difficult.  <br><br>But because of God’s love for us, God always gives us enough grace to meet the demands. <br><br>What God wants to give us far outweighs what God asks of us.  When God asks us to do something, it is because the fullest possible life is in that direction.  And, God is always willing to give us everything we need to do it.  So, God not only asks, God also enables.<br><br>Just listen to the encouraging words of the scripture: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“I have come that you may have life, and have it abundantly.” “These things I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.” “My grace is sufficient for you.” “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you.  But not as the world gives do I give to you.  Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.”  “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.”  “They who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.”</span><br><br>Those are the gifts that God wants to give us.  Life is to be an adventure, a blessing, a celebration.  What God wants is for our faith to enable us to spread our wings and fly!  So our boundaries are expanded, and we can sing our songs of praise. That is the nature of authentic Christianity!<br><br>The most important thing is how to make the transition from a God “out there” telling us what to do, to a God “in here” helping us to become all we can be, and helping us to do what we ought to do.  <br><br>It makes all the difference in the world to understand that we receive God’s gifts not because we have obeyed the rules; rather, we are able to obey God’s rules because we first have received the gifts that are offered to us!  <br><br>Thus, as look at our scripture passage in that light, we hear these words of Jesus not so much as demands to be obeyed, but with the promise that God will empower us.  <br><br>God is not saying to us, “These are things you must do before I can love you.”  Instead, God tells us, “This is the kind of person I will help you to become.”  That changes everything.<br><br>Take that most difficult verse of all, the one about being perfect. What if “be perfect” is not a commandment, but a promise?  And what if perfection really means complete – the complete you – the complete person God has created you to be?  What if that is not something God demands, but something God wants to give?  <br><br>When we understand it that way, we then come to know not a God “out there” making demands upon us, but a God “in here” giving us everything we need, and enabling us to grow into the persons God intends us to be—the perfect you or the perfect me!  That to me is good news!  That is the gospel.  Boundaries are expanded.  And I see a lot of opportunities open before us.  <br> <br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A member of the church where I served before was diagnosed with cancer.  But the doctors also found out that she was a few months pregnant. She decided not to have the chemotherapy before the baby was ready to be born.  But then, after delivering the baby, the cancer had already spread.  She was given a few months to live.  I visited her at the hospital where we talked about death and about her faith.  She said, “Pastor, having known Jesus, I am not afraid to die.  I am thankful to God that I am given a few months to be with my baby.”  As I looked into her eyes, I did not have to ask her whether her faith was a burden or one that opens new boundaries.  Her faith was her single greatest source of meaning and strength and hope. I know that it was her faith that offered expanded boundaries for her, for her family and her baby.  And that is the way it is supposed to be.</span><br><br>And if that is our faith, it too can expand boundaries for us and our lips will be filled with song of joy and praise. <br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

I was a guest there at a conference a couple of weeks ago, and brought my camera along.<BR><BR>Antulang is indeed a very large and attractive place; perched on a high bluff above the sea at the southernmost tip of  Negros, it has all the requirements for a great resort: wide ocean views from its guest rooms and villas; white sand beaches, shaded walking paths, open air restaurants, a gigantic swimming pool, etc.<BR><BR>I could have photographed any of these features; but then again, who needs to see more pictures of swimming pools and beaches? Thatâ€™s for advertising brochures, thatâ€™s not what Iâ€™m after. It was these strange staircases that caught my eye. <BR><BR>Thereâ€™s a weird sense of space here; disorienting. Each set of stairs has its own separate  perspective leading the eye away. It almost looks like two pictures combined. It takes effort to see it as an actual viewpoint, a real place.  And the character of each set of stairs is different, too -- even though theyâ€™re in the same place, and made out of the same stone.<BR><BR>Itâ€™s like two pathways to different destinies. The stairs seen on the left is dark and cut off from sight by a  stained blank wall; itâ€™s a path that seems to lead nowhere, or at least nowhere good.  <BR><BR>But the stairs on the right is wide and sunlit, and it leads out of the picture in a long sweeping curve. You would certainly expect a happier result from following this path. But you might be wrong.<BR><BR>Itâ€™s a common metaphor in song and story, and now, in this picture. You come to diverging stairways, or two paths in the forest, or a fork in the highway. You canâ€™t be one person and take both paths; you have to take one or the other, and you canâ€™t know for certain where each one will take you, or what the result will be. <BR><BR>And appearances can fool you. Like here, in this picture.  What seems to be the better path into the sunlight may turn out badly. The darker stairs may lead to you on to greater happiness. You have to take one or the other.

By and large, they were accurate historical chronicles of the events that led to the People Power Revolution in February 1986. <br><br>The Department of Education should conduct video showings of this important segment of our history, and  open discussions should be made on the importance of  remembering this life- changing event.<br><br>At the outset, it is important  to note that although Marcos and his cronies were booted out of the country, many cynics comment: ”Ali Baba may be gone but his 40 thieves have remained and have even multiplied!”<br><br>Filipinos are a strange species because they are the only type of  humans who can laugh at themselves and make jokes out of their misery. <br><br>And yes, maybe even the jokes will help people remember and recall why it is important to take care of our freedom, and to remind our public officials they are holding offices as a public trust. They are there because the people put them there, and it is the people who are giving them their compensation and perks. <br><br>When the Marcoses were in power, they were in the “mining business”, as in, “This is mine, that is mine!” We should collectively  recall, reminisce, and renew our commitment that we should never allow the return of  any form of dictatorship. It is very difficult  to have  a government composed of people who have unabated  thirst for money, power, and privilege beyond measure.<br><br>“One who does not remember and learn lessons from history are bound to repeat its mistakes!” Let us teach our children and grandchildren about the lessons of  EDSA; it is our duty to   set the  records  straight, and  avert the return to power of any of the Marcoses, his cronies or his clones.  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Never again!</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

I used the same title for an article on the Social Reform Agenda which I wrote for a leading NGO’s publication when the SRA was just starting to mobilize practically the whole government bureaucracy (ca. 1995).  Now I’m using it again to (hopefully) persuade local government executives in Negros Oriental to consider the lessons from the SRA’s implementation back in the 1990s.  This is because, as FVR said, the LGUs have “the first contact with poverty.”<br><br>At the core of the SRA’s convergence strategy is the Minimum Basic Needs approach. The MBNs are grouped under three broad categories: Survival needs <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(food and nutrition; water and sanitation; health; and clothing)</span>; Security needs <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(income and livelihood; shelter and housing; peace and order; and public safety)</span>; Enabling or Empowering needs <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(basic education/functional literacy; family/psycho-social care; and participation in community affairs)</span>.  These are the basic services that LGUs are obliged to deliver to all their constituents.  The self-applied MBN surveys by households in barangays let the LGUs know which basic services were needed, and should therefore be prioritized.<br><br>Since the SRA is no longer a national program, there is no more need for the localization strategy — the adjustment of national policies and programs to better suit the peculiar demands and conditions or nuances of local communities and sectors.  This assumes that such local demands and needs are in fact already being addressed by local governments, proceeding from local initiatives sourced in the 20percent development fund of LGUs, as well as the existing and available national programs. These include agrarian reform, fisheries programs, health programs, ancestral domains and other environmental protection initiatives, etc.<br><br>The convergence strategy, on the other hand, is the close coordination and synchronization of government interventions to bear upon specific problems in a locality. It entails vertical and horizontal linkages that funnel and focus government efforts and resources. This approach is still being used in the Agrarian Reform Communities. Any government program or project that involves multiple partners or agencies and various levels uses the convergence strategy to some degree or another. But the driving force of all these efforts comes from the participation and involvement of the beneficiaries themselves. The LGUs invariably take up the cudgels for these beneficiaries, who are their constituents. This is what FVR’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">bibingka</span> method was all about — <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">bibingka</span> is cooked with fire above (the national political and development thrusts) and fire below (the social pressure from beneficiaries of government programs and projects).<br><br>If the 557 barangays of Negros Oriental check out in terms of basic services delivery (whether according to the MBNs or LGUs’ checklists or Maslow’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Hierarchy of Needs</span>), it means that the province’s human development index should be at a high level. Other poverty indicators such as income levels may still be generally low, but at least with basic services needs being met, the quality of life in the barangays should be at acceptable levels.  Now if we have to connect all this with the Millennium Development Goals, it’s the same banana. Perhaps the Province’s (website) profile could more directly reflect these quality of life indicators to complement all those comparative socio-economic statistics.<br><br>This development outcome in the province (including municipalities and cities, of course) is what would “equalize” local citizens: the primary quality of life is the same across all sectors and communities on the basis of the availability of basic (social) services. During the SRA’s implementation, its localization and convergence strategies and the core MBN approach brought the “war” on poverty from the level of national policy and political rhetoric to the level of local governance and communities (barangays).<br><br>The provincial leadership may take a look at the records of SRA implementation in Negros Oriental. There may still be some gaps remaining, but if these can be addressed and integrated into the current local development thrusts and priorities, then this will add a new twist to that Ubuntu saying, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“I am who I am because of who we all are.”</span><br><br>Carlos Bueno<br><a href=\"mailto:caloy.bueno@gmail.com\">caloy.bueno@gmail.com</a><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

By mid 1980s, the Net emerged, followed in the next decade by new generation tools: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.<br><br>The explosive growth of near instant communication,  on  Internet,  had a deep  impact on culture, commerce -- and  Arab  dictators. Here are two countries’ experiences, culled from an extensive  Channel 4  survey : <br><br>LIBYA: In 41-years of one-man rule, Moammar  Ghadaffi, clamped total control on media, notes  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Reporters Without Borders</span>.   But Internet  vaulted these firewalls. Citizen journalists   uploaded information and pictures Libyans   fighting back, as Ghadaffi waged  war on his own people.<br><br>“My name is freedom,” messaged @AliTweel on Twitter.  “Born in Tunisia, raised in Egypt, studied in Yemen, fought in Libya, and I’ll grow up in the Arab world”. <br><br>Omar Amer adds: “There are no more ‘Chinese whispers’.

Libyan bloggers use Twitter  hashtag #Feb17 -- the day  when  mercenaries gunned down 12 protestors.  <br><br>The first issue of  an uncensored newspaper Libya appeared.  And the opposition turned two state radio stations against Ghadaffi (Filipino  rebels took over Channel 4 on Feb. 24,  and began broadcasts for People Power.)<br><br>Ghadaffi muzzled  Internet, as did Egypt’s Mubarak, and Tunisia’s Ben Ali. But users resorted to proxy servers. They uploaded  pictures of Libyan helicopter pilots who ordered to fire at demonstrators, defected instead. (Marcos ordered  Col. Antonio Sotelo to lead the 15th Strike Wing based at Sangley Point to  “neutralize helicopters in  rebel-held Camp Crame. Sotelo and  squadron  chose to land at  Camp Crame  and  defect, duly reported by Radyo Bandido.)<br><br>BAHRAIN:As in Egypt, Bahrainis use  “live web streaming devices to broadcast images directly from the protests”. Ustream and Bambuser <a href=\"http://www.ustream.tv/\">  http://www.ustream.tv/</a> enabled youth to film live while shaking shoes at rulers. Twitter hashtag #Feb14 -- the first  Valentine day protest -- became the identity of  Bahrain’s alternative media.  <br><br>The regime blocked websites where Facebook  provided a platform for debate and mobilization. Clips of  police storming the protest camp, in central Manama,  appeared on YouTube. (Here, People Power erupted  as Filipino communists quarreled, in safe houses, whether they’d  join. They didn’t -- and ended up as “history’s orphans”. They haven’t  lived that one down.<br><br>Ghadfaffi  blamed Al Qaeda for the revolt. Without exception, the revolts are not driven, in fact,  not  by bearded  immans  vowing <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">jihads</span>. They’re  led by disaffected internet savvy and often disorganized  youths.  With their elders, they  seek  reforms and  broader human freedoms.  (Like Filipinos, they’ll find that disposing dictators is only a  step in the tortuous transition to a more humane society.)<br><br>The Arab world reels from massive deficits in education, women rights, and freedom.  UNDP’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Arab Human Development Report 2009</span>, documents these obstacles,  noted <span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> Viewpoint</span>  (PDI/Feb. 22).<br><br>“Per capita expenditure on education in Arab countries dropped from 20 percent of that in industrialized countries in 1980 to 10 percent in the mid-1990s.

Most of my students are in their senior year, you see, and with graduation looming, we have to wrap up classes by the first week of March.  That means my workload lightens up almost a month before the official end of the term.<br><br>Are students happy to see classes end?  Double that joy for teachers!  No more lessons to prepare, no more lectures to deliver, no more papers to check, free if only briefly to pursue our research interests....<br><br>But truth be told, I’m going to miss this batch.  I can’t explain it but in the three years that I’ve been teaching at Ateneo de Davao, I’ve come to realize that classes are like wine.  There are good years, there are middling years, and there are years of exceptional vintage.  Like this year, for instance.<br><br>For this year, the Computer Studies Division has produced two BPI Science Awardees (one of whom made it to the front page of the Philippine Daily Inquirer) and three candidates for Most Outstanding Student.  And really, that doesn’t even count the other fine young people whose skills, while amazing, don’t fit the acknowledged academic measures.<br><br>To be sure, I have still had students who chose to coast along, or even clown their way through, but they’ve been outshone by the diligence with which their classmates applied themselves.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">      * * *<br></div><br><br>        Because of the sagacity of this batch, I decided to try something new with the Open Source elective they took under me.  At the beginning of the semester, I told them they could choose what they wanted to learn.  I don’t think I came to the decision consciously.  It just seemed the right step to take.<br><br>I had parameters, yes, but they were meant more to guide than to hem in. They had to work with open source software, preference given but not limited to web application frameworks.  Oh, and also: I wouldn’t be teaching them, they would have to map out their own program of learning.  I’d act more as coach and troubleshooter than professor.  And finally, towards the end of the class, they would be expected to teach what they learned.<br><br>Looking back, it was a risky move and I did end up with some disappointing results.  Some loafers, sadly, never really got their act together and continued to muddle through without producing anything substantial.  Some otherwise smart eggs chose unviable projects and painted themselves into a corner.  Some opted to play it safe, and correspondingly got boring results.<br><br>But those who tried to fly?  Ah, they soared!  After I gave some brief explanation about how the frameworks worked, many groups took the tools and went wild with them.  More than just learning the software, they started building their own mini-projects with them without any prompting from me.  By the end of the semester, I had three teams working on their own variation of social networking and e-commerce web sites, built from scratch using CodeIgniter, CakePHP, and jQuery.<br><br>The results which pleased me most came from the students where I least expected them from.  One pair I had pegged as loud and pesky coasters took on an open source point-of-sale system and customized it thoroughly.  Another trio delved into the Eclipse IDE and came up with demonstrations of the most useful plugins.<br><br>Perhaps the best surprise came from two brothers whom I had taught the year before.  In my classes then, I found them frequently distracted, not entirely following my lectures or only half-heartedly doing my labs.  Instead, they’d be spending time looking over fantasy artwork on the web.  For this class, I pointed them to the Blender 3D animation software and told them to just play with it.  Throughout the semester, I saw them mold out a dragon and a knight -- not haphazard cartoons, mind you, but very intricate and very realistic models.  At the end of the sem, they showed us fully rendered scenes that looked like they came out of a movie.<br><br>All throughout, I kept my lectures to a minimum (I think I only gave five presentations in all.)  Instead, we’d have checkpoints where I would ask the groups to report briefly on where they were on their projects.  No quizzes or exams, either; instead, I set up a blog where they were to write weekly on what they had learned.  The blog would be the basis for their grades.<br><br>True to my original intent, the students did get to teach.  We scheduled weeks when teams were to conduct lectures and lab exercises for their classmates (and me.)  For the most part, these classes were quite lively, and it seems students paid more attention to their peers than they ever did to me.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">    * * *<br></div><br><br>        The high point for this class, our major activity for the term, was an open source mini-conference that my students organized.  ATMOSphere, we called it -- Advanced Technologies Meets Open Source -- a name we inherited from my class of the previous year when we ran a similar mini-conference.  My students did all the promotion and the organization, as well as all the speaking duties, drawing from their experiences in class.  Time to pass on what they had learned.  Their audience comprised of the lower batches and our faculty.<br><br>It didn’t end there, either.  After ATMOSphere, a co-teacher asked me if my students could also run the same talks at another university.  “You’ll have to ask them yourself,” I laughed.  “They’re their own folks now.”<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Roel Degamo in his first State-of-the-Province address. <br><br>Indeed. And the questions are: How do you address the health needs of a people whose homes are located in the Motorcycle Capital of the Philippines? Is it possible to have healthy people living in a potentially unhealthy environment?<br><br>While Negrenenses take pride in their Province being the national motorcycle capital of the Philippines, and often cite their success in organizing the \"longest motorcycle parada\" in 2008 as part of the Buglasan festival, I see no social significance or value in such a status. <br><br>Motorcyclists who seldom use their legs for walking are prone to osteoporosis, and the fumes emitted from thousands of motorcycles pollute the air that we breath, making everyone susceptible to respiratory diseases. <br><br>I noted that the good Governor's plan for promoting people's health focused on curative measures (more hospitals and clinics, but not a single park accessible to residents of Metro Dumaguete where people could go for family picnics, informal play, recreation and relaxation... \"a city where there are more hospitals than parks is sick...\" a lesson I learned in a graduate recreation course). There are few, if any at all, in the Governor's SOPA that suggest a response to the wisdom of the adage: \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\"<br><br>So where do we start? Let's start with the babies who need to be vaccinated. While there are free vaccinations in health centers, there are still mothers who have to cough up P1,200 for one of three doses of HIB vaccine, in private clinics. For the children in school, the WHO and the DepEd recommend that school canteens refrain from selling junk food, and the school feeding program should be fully supported and sustained.<br><br>For the young people in college â€” and for that matter, everybody -- the answer may be found in the Governor's plan to \"review the Negros Oriental Sports Development Program.\" <br><br>For the past five years, I have been asking what is the NOSDP, if there is any? Who is in-charge? What are the year-round activities? Who are the target participants? And up to now, I am not told, nor see any program that is being implemented with vigor and consistency.<br><br>Regular participation by the greatest number in exercise and physical activity such as walking, running, aerobics, ballroom dancing, sports is the basics of a program to promote health and wellness among the residents of Negros Oriental â€” and I see none of these being undertaken in what the Governor says as the NOSDP. <br><br>There are models in place that those who are in-charge of the provincial program could replicate. First of all are the fun runs such as the recently-held and successful \"Run for your Heart\" organized by the Silliman University High School batch 1980. I don't recall any similar event being staged by the Province. <br><br>There is this group of ladies doing aerobics at the bayfront in the mornings. Why can't the Province organize something similar to this at the stage of the Freedom Park? <br><br>There are also senior citizens enthusiastically doing ballroom dancing at the Quezon Park. Why can't the Province support this activity since ballroom dancing is an excellent exercise, not only for seniors, but for everybody? A regularly-held Saturday night ballroom dancing â€” <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">apil tanan</span> at the Macias Sports & Cultural Center would be a hit for a people who love to dance. Next to walking, ballroom dancing is the best lifetime exercise.<br><br>Then there are the Youth@Play sports tournaments of the Institute of Youth Sports for Peace where children and youth can participate in 3-on-3 basketball, volleyball, futsal, and sepak takraw. <br><br>Why can't the Province organize similar leagues using the facilities of the Perdices Field and the big space of the Freedom Park for similar activities? These two facilities should be teeming with children and people indulging in physical activity â€” with the encouragement and support of the Province.<br><br>When students in the physical education classes were found to be at health risk because of obesity at such a young age, Foundation University made walking a quarter marathon a requirement for graduation. I am sure students of the other institutions likewise exhibit the same risks â€”hence, the Province could encourage walking as a form of exercise â€” to counteract the potential health risks that the thousands of motorcyclists in our midst are prone to. The more that motorcyclists walk and ride less, this act is contributory to the mitigation of climate change.<br><br>We recommend that the Province craft a program to promote and create a \"walking culture\" in Negros Oriental. Foundation University uses the \"Quarter Marathon Wellness Walk\" to do this. <br><br>In pursuing this objective, our campus hara are assigned the task of promoting the program. For so many years now, our <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">hara</span>, like their counterparts in other institutions, have been selected without assigning them any specific role that binds them to a social contract. Starting this year, and every year thereafter, our FU <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">hara</span> will dedicate themselves to promoting a culture of walking in our locality.<br><br>We laud and support Governor Degamo's campaign for healthy Negrenenses.

These substances have evolved as chemical defense mechanisms against predation. <br><br>However, some predators have, in the course of time, also countered the threat by developing enzyme systems to detoxify these poisons, and actually make use of them as food. So in nature, the race between prey and predators go on and on.<br><br>Scientists are now exploring how to turn poisons or toxins in plants and animals into useful medicinal medicines. The common examples are the toxins from venomous snakes, which are injected into large animals to induce the production of antivenins (the antitoxins against venoms). <br><br>When a person is bitten by a venomous snake, he is injected with antivenins specific to the group to which the snake belongs. That is why the offending species of snake must be identified by a competent authority before treatment.<br><br>For example, the antivenins for bites by the common cobra, which is found in larger islands of the Philippines, are the ones effective against bites of the common cobra. Such antivenins are not effective against bites of pit vipers, another group of venomous snakes in the Philippines. <br><br>Now, scientists are exploring further uses of toxins from a wide variety of animals such as cone shells, crabs, spiders, scorpions, wasps, stonefish, toads, snakes, lizards, etc. by studying their chemical properties. <br><br>Research in this area requires well-equipped chemical laboratories, as the focus is on identifying specific and active molecular components in venoms and poisons and controlled testing of their effects. Apparently, some progress has been made in developed countries such as the United States and Japan.<br><br>In the Philippines, some academic institutions are equipped to make preliminary experiments in the study of poisons and venoms. In collaboration with scientists in advanced countries, some notable discoveries have been made. An example can be cited. <br><br>Dr. Lourdes Cruz, a National Scientist at the University of the Philippines Diliman, has discovered some chemical components in cone shell toxin that are potent pain killer. She and another Filipino in the United States have been internationally recognized for their discovery.<br><br>This cone shell (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Conus geographus</span>) is found in our coral reefs. It is, however, rare at this time because of over-collection. Our own research has documented a couple of non-fatal cases of cone sting in Central Visayas.<br><br>From the examples cited, I would like to point out that species known for their poisonous or venomous nature are useful in research and should not be exterminated. Our human judgment that some species are useless is only based on incomplete knowledge of these species. Like us, these species deserve their rightful place on earth.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Weâ€™d visited the town just two days before to report a story and take photos about life in the westernmost section of revolutionary territory.<br><br>We arrived about 1 p.m. at a large gathering of revolutionaries who were staging a counterattack at the gates of Ajdabya. A line of men about a hundred yards long and three deep were praying. When they finished, many jumped into cars and wove their way through dozens of men lined up on each side of the highway, chanting and waving their arms, flags, and weapons in the air.<br><br>Our taxi driver refused to go any farther, and we hitched a ride with a couple of revolutionary volunteers, following close behind the main convoy. We eventually pulled off the highway and took the coast road through the town of Port Brega, where the streets teemed with residents and armed men. All along the coast road, revolutionaries walked or drove toward the sound of heavy gunfire echoing in the distance.<br><br>High above, a fighter jet circled before dropping a bomb near the campus of a local university. We saw a large cloud of black smoke rising from the desert floor, and waited about 30 minutes before pushing on. All around us, men armed with AK-47s talked excitedly while pointing their fingers into the distance.<br><br>I kept taking pictures and prayed that we wouldnâ€™t draw fire.<br><br>For the next two hours, we alternately hitched more rides or walked before reaching the university, where all was quiet. We let the revolutionaries push about a half mile ahead before catching yet another ride to the far western edge of Port Brega, where several vehicles burned furiously beside the road.<br><br>At a nearby checkpoint, elated revolutionaries told us they had repelled the attack, and Kadafiâ€™s forces were on the run. As more men arrived at the site, an impromptu celebration broke out, with a lot yelling, chanting, and random gunshots fired into the air. It was a crazy and chaotic scene. And it made great pictures.<br><br>As the sun started to set, we joined a convoy of revolutionaries giving chase to Kadafiâ€™s forces, who were beating a hasty retreat west. They were beyond sight, but we followed at high speeds for about another 12 miles. At a small village down the road, the revolutionaries gave up their pursuit, and began yet another victory celebration, with more yelling, chanting, and shooting.<br><br>On the trip back, we saw many more celebratory scenes. The revolutionaries clearly were overjoyed at turning back the forces of the hated dictator. Many chanted over and over, â€œGod is great!â€<br><br>As we neared Port Brega, I saw a huge explosion about a mile ahead. Black smoke and dirt filled the air. We turned left to Port Brega and saw a large crater in the middle of the road that we had to take back to the city. We found out that a passing plane had dropped a bomb before continuing its flight westward. It occurred to me that if weâ€™d been there just a few minutes earlier, that bomb would have landed right on top of us.<br><br>I asked our driver -- a baby-faced boy with close-cropped hair â€” if he realized just how close weâ€™d come to being blown to bits. He spoke only Arabic, and I tried to emphasize the point by making a small space between my thumb and forefinger. Yes, that close. Unimpressed, he looked at me, pointed skyward, and said: â€œGod.â€ (LA Times)<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>You’ve surely heard of the maxim “The customer is always right.” But are they, really? <BR><BR>Suzanne Lu-Bascara, associate director of SPI Global, dissected this concept in her keynote speech during the opening of the Digital, Business, Tourism and Culinary Art Expo 2011 last month at Foundation University.{{more}}<BR><BR>Her conclusion: This concept is unrealistic and unlimiting.<BR><BR>“It made employees unhappy in the face of unruly customers because the management would have to side with the costumer even if the employee was right,” she said.<BR><BR>She said the trend is for customers and employees to work together as partners. “Problems of our customers are our problems inasmuch as our problems are their problems too,” she said.<BR><BR>Bascara cited an instance at her workplace where they initially had problems meeting customers’ deadlines. “Their volumes were unpredictable. On the weeks where volume was high, our employees would go on overtime but there would be nothing for them to do next week, when the work volume would dip.”<BR><BR>So, they presented their problem to the customer, who saw the need to keep the volume of work steady in order to maintain the volume without making employees go on overtime.<BR><BR>“If this happened 10 years ago, the client would have probably said that it was not their problem and that if we could not cope, they will just look for another supplier,” she said. <BR><BR>Another trend in today’s dynamic business world is complementing coexistence. This model, as exemplified by food vendors in Bangkok, has one vendor selling only one commodity. One would sell rice and noodles, another would sell soft drinks, another would sell barbecue and another would sell soup. “Every vendor stands a better chance of having all their food sold than having 10 tocino stalls next to each other, like we do in the Philippines,” she said.<BR><BR>Bascara’s speech focused on the theme, “Working in a collaborative environment.”<BR><BR>Victor Vicente “Dean” Sinco, vice president for finance and administration, said the successful Digital, Business, Tourism and Culinary Art Expo 2011 was visited by students not only from Foundation University but from other schools, colleges and universities in Dumaguete and Negros Oriental.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><div id=\"disqus_thread\"></div><BR><script type=\"text/javascript\"><BR>    /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */<BR>    var disqus_shortname = 'Metropost'; // required: replace example with your forum shortname<BR><BR>    // The following are highly recommended additional parameters.

How can it be clear and confused at the same time? How can it be the same and yet different?  <br><br>Self-contradictory, that precisely is an oxymoron.  A juxtaposition of two contrasting words, personalities, circumstances or events.  Call it a paradox, if one may.  The paradox of the irresistible force.  <br><br>What happens when an unstoppable force collides against an immovable wall?

They assume greater role in winning.  <br><br>When Jun was winning, he rubbed it on Czar.  In glee, he would declare, “No matter what variation you play, it’s the same difference, the same result, I win.”  When Czar was winning, he would whoop it up with, “I’m a chess genius! I’m chess czar.” Then he broke through with a knowing look all around him, and almost always stressed it with a silly grin on me, more to spite Jun than to tell me anything at all.  The power of one look.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">                *****<br></div><br><br>        The Filipino Flash was fast and furious with his fists.  Fleeting as a light flash and furious like a raging bull, the Filipino Flash Nonito Donaire demolished WBO and WBC Bantamweight Champion Fernando Montiel of Mexico in their title fight at Las Vegas, Nevada last week.  The demolition job came fast and furious 2’25” past in the 2nd round when Donaire caught with a counter left hook Montiel’s right temple that sent him crumpling to the canvass.  For a few arresting moments after he sagged to the canvass, Montiel lay on his back.  His legs and hands twitching in the air.  His eyes glazed in helplessness.  He managed to stand up, wobbled down, and up again as the referee decided he was still fit to fight on.  Donaire came swooping down to finish his prey.  With two punches and no counter from Montiel, the referee stopped the fight. Prior to this defeat, Montiel held sway over the flyweight and bantamweight divisions.  His record speaks for itself 44-3-2 with 34 KOs.  Donaire is 26-1 with 18 KOs.  Donaire recalled, “I just came out there believing what I had.  I hit him with a left hook, looked down and saw him twitching.”  Montiel averred, “I knew we both had the punching power to knock each other out.  I made the first mistake I paid for it.” The 12-round championship fight was brought to an abrupt ending as the ring announcer exclaimed “What has happened!”  Donaire’s Promoter Bob Arum as a postcript to the abbreviated fight wondered, “What’s this...with kids from General Santos City? They have the speed and power.”  Arum was referring to Nonito Donaire and Manny Pacquiao as he got excited in thinking of Donaire following Manny’s  footsteps in conquering higher weight divisions all the way to130lbs.<br><br>Donaire’s demolition display has arrested the attention of the world.  The Filipino Flash, like Manny the Pacman, is making a big difference for Filipinos at home and abroad.  Flash and Pacman make them feel real Filipinos, walking tall and walking proud.  They are good for the Filipino psyche, for the Filipino nation’s soul which is reeling under the stinking stench of corruption and grinding poverty for the impoverished majority.  With a wham here, Donaire makes a difference.  With wham there, Manny makes the difference.  Wham and wham, during their fights Filipinos stop, look, and watch the TV screens including soldiers and rebels who have been shooting each other since yesteryears.  They are making the same difference--the power of one.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">                *****<br></div><br><br>        Heidi is one woman.  Heidi in German means the noble kind, the noble one.  Heidi in PH is Heidi Mendoza.  By admission, she is a witch to the max.  But what a hex of a witch.  As a former COA auditor, she risks family peace and life to present the trail of corruption in the AFP during a Senate Hearing In-aid of Legislation.  In upholding the family and country values of honesty, integrity and public accountability; she unmasks the AFP as the bastion of idealistic coup plotters and protector of the Constitution.   <br><br>Protect-corrupt is an oxymoron. It can only mean protecting corruption or the corrupt themselves.  The power of one.  Make a triple whammy of Donaire, Manny, and Heidi.  Who knows what the future holds for the Philippines?  Make the number of Donaires, Mannys, and Heidis into a critical mass;  then you make the power of one into a power of all.  Sure as the sun rises, we heal the Philippines. We make a better Philippines.<br><br>2K11 and about 400 years ago, Jesus Christ was born into the never-ending battle of good against evil.  His message as God Incarnate, as the Word made flesh, is the power of love. The power of love is the power of One. After His death and resurrection, His disciples turned the World upside down with the power of love.  The disciples even made converts out of the Roman conquerors who crucified Jesus.  <br><br>The battle rages on.  Mankind persists in denial mode.  Mankind insists on a belief that Jesus is only a teacher and his message only a doctrine, no different from the other moral teachers. They lose the way, blind-fold the truth, and impoverish life. We fall short of the glory of a beautiful Love Relationship with the Father in Heaven through Jesus, the God Incarnate. Same difference no more, the real difference. <br> <br>The power of love, the power of One.  Unity in Trinity.

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“….let your light shine… that they may see your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven.” – Matthew 5:16</span><br><br> I recently found a website that contained a vast information of pastors and priests who figured in high-profile scandals - - - mostly sexual and financial in nature.  It was disheartening.   I was overtaken by a deep sense of frustration, shock and helplessness.  How does one even begin to process such information?  Last Thursday I also heard a powerful message shared by veteran journalist Ed Lingao who is the Multimedia Director of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism and a distinguished Marshall McLuhan awardee.  He gave an excellent presentation of the Philippine media situation, particularly the moral and ethical controversies that have stained the integrity and honorability of media practice in this nation.  But more importantly, Mr. Lingao also discussed the increasing culture of greed, shamelessness and self-indulgence in our time.   Again, I was overwhelmed by the realization that for the right price, some people will really sell their soul to the devil.   I found myself crying out to the Lord - - - not with tears, but with a deep, gripping and painful groan in my spirit.  What have we done to ourselves? What have we done to our children? O God, have mercy!<br><br>There are no shortcuts to genuine transformation, I realized. There are no quick fixes, nippy incantations or fast-acting solutions that can solve our pitiful state.   Change is and will always be a slow, painful and agonizing process - - - the very reasons why many would no longer even want to engage in such an endeavor.  But then, why not?   As American author, columnist and speaker Dennis Prager puts it, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Just because you cannot fight every evil does not mean you should fight no evils.”</span><br><br>But it is more than fighting evil.  It is about coming to terms with truth - - - the truth that can usher a deeper understanding of the kind of evil we are fighting and the realm on which we are waging our war.  First, we need to grapple with the reality that humanity’s wickedness is powerful and unstoppable.  No amount of behavior modification will ever be enough to put a stop to our natural and instinctive craving to gratify ourselves.    Second, we need to recognize that only God’s relentless, tenacious and redemptive righteousness is greater than all of humanity’s transgressions and impiety combined.   God demonstrated this righteousness when he, in the fullness of time, ushered his son, Jesus, into earthly existence despite imaginable human impossibility.  This righteousness was again demonstrated when God, defying the very laws of logic and reason, called forth the tortured, mangled and lifeless body of Jesus from the dead.   By his Spirit, he sent a power no word can ever describe, redeeming a body that was on its way to sure decay, and declaring it victorious over death by his glorious might.    Third, we are called to make a conscious and deliberate choice to align ourselves with Christ, the very embodiment of God’s redemptive love and righteousness - -- not only intellectually as a matter of mental cognizance  but relationally and intimately as Savior and Lord.  Such relationship is to be entered into not with emotional intensity but with utmost sincerity, fully believing that when we enter into a  genuine and heartfelt relationship with Christ, we die to ourselves and Christ’s very life rises from within us, enabling us to pursue a life of integrity through works that are true, compassionate, merciful and just.     <br><br>In God’s wisdom, we have all been called to fight evil in the arena of our respective spheres and influences.  We cannot all be in government.  We cannot all be in institutions.  We have been strategically placed by the Lord in homes, communities and various workplaces - - - as parents to our children; as employees and workers; as educators and leaders; as servants of the church; as employers; as advocates for life and creation .  The diversity is valuable and the potentials for transformative witness are enormous.  Jesus calls us, his precious people, not to be weary but to let our lights shine steadfastly through what is good, pleasing and edifying. We wonder at times how our bleak and austere lights can even make the slightest difference, but it does and it always will.  Dark as the world has become, evil as the times have grown, still, we fight it out – earnestly and intently, unto God whom we can never mock and for the sake of others who refuse to give up because of that flicker of light they continue to see in us and through us.  It’s a tall order but someone’s got to do it! O God, have mercy!  Have mercy indeed!

A perverse one at that—but what’s to say about “perversity” when the grammar of things in this isolated world that the film depicts has been turned upside-down to fit the needs of its maker? <br><br>The maker, of course, is the Father, a master manipulator who, together with the enabler Mother, keeps his three children—Older Daughter, Younger Daughter, and Son, all in their 20s—within the confines of a sprawling estate in an isolated Greek countryside. They don’t have names, they have no conception of what the outside world looks like, and they play and run around like children secure and uncurious about the world behind the high fences that surround their house. They have been taught all their lives to fear and avoid this outside world: it is a dangerous place where house cats roam and maul people—including their unfortunate younger brother who dared set foot outside many years ago and finally met a bloody end. <br><br>When the outside world does occasionally intrude, Father and Mother have built a system of lies consisting of a different grammar for things. The Son, for example, asks what a “zombie” is. And the Mother replies, “It’s a small yellow flower.” A “telephone” is a “salt shaker.” Frank Sinatra singing “My Way” is their grandfather singing, in a foreign tongue that needs translation, about his love for the family. The airplanes that fly overhead are toys that occasionally fall into their garden. Like benevolent caretakers, Father and Mother tell them that they are ready to face the outside world only when they will lose their “dogtooth.” When a cat gets into the garden, Son kills it with a pair of garden shears, and soon Father teaches them to protect themselves by getting down on all fours and bark like dogs.<br><br>That’s the iconic image we get of the universe in this film: the Father and his family bent over like dogs, barking ferociously. It’s a self-contained world built by Father’s creative manipulation—and by that count, they are all happy. Why wouldn’t they be?<br><br>But there are needs to be met. Mother and Father hire an outsider named Christine, a security guard at the factory the father works in, to come and do sexual favors for the Son. She does so without questioning this strange world, even when she has to enter the family compound blindfolded. But her entry to this world proves to be this weird Eden’s serpent. One day, after lackluster sex with Son, Christine propositions Older Daughter that she is going to give her a gift—a “phosphorescent headband”—if she licks Christine’s “keyboard,” the children’s word for the vagina. In the next visit, Older Daughter rejects Christine’s new gift of a hair gel—and forces her to give what she has found inside Christine’s bag: two videocasettes of Jaws and Rocky. Older Daughter watches these films in secret but soon surrenders them to Father—who proceeds to punish her by whipping her head violently with the videocassettes. Still, the Serpent has been let loose in this Garden. Older Daughter has a new game to play with her siblings—acting out, complete with memorized dialogue, the scenes from the films she has seen: she does the boxing scenes from Rocky and the hunt for the Great White from Jaws. Later, when she dances for Father and Mother’s wedding anniversary celebration, she moves feverishly not to the cadence of Son’s guitar-playing, but to an imagined soundtrack from some other film—Jennifer Beals’ audition dance from Flashdance. It is a dance of rebellion, a subtly played revolution for this young woman. For her, the contraband movies are the roots of her eventual enlightenment.<br><br>This film is Older Daughter’s story, about her awakening and about her escape. (Or is there an escape?)<br><br>What an unsettling film this is, and I appreciate it for the wide-ranging allegory that it is. In my use of Eden and the serpent, I obviously see a religious parallel to the story. But it can also be read as a take on real-life monstrosities as the Fritzl case in Austria where a father locks up his daughter in the basement for 23 years and makes her his sex slave. It can be read as a critique of Mediterranean family culture. It can be read as an attack against unquestioning adherence to “the way things are supposed to be.” You take what you will from this film—it is an original, a harsh and unflinching depiction of psychological realism that makes you question what you believe about the world you live in, and how we go about our lives knowing one set of grammar to understand things. But what if all of this is just a lie? What dogtooth must we lose to see things as they are? And are we at all willing to bloody ourselves for that glimpse?<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>International Women’s Day will be celebrated on March 8, as it has been for many years. It is a celebration of women’s political, economic and social achievements, a reminder that despite the fact that women have many rights that were previously denied them (voting, education, equal rights), there are still important things to be done.  <BR><BR>Women are oppressed and suffering in many countries; here in the Philippines, some of the most pressing issues are the freedom to divorce, and reproductive choice.<BR><BR>When I was young, I always dreamed of getting married and having children. I pictured myself as a great mom with several kids.  But when I got married, I changed my mind.  I like children, and I enjoy spending time with them, but I’m not up to the task of raising them. I just felt I wasn’t the kind of person who could dedicate myself sufficiently to meeting their needs.  <BR><BR>Frankly, I’m too lazy, too self-involved, and I have too many unresolved issues of my own.  Luckily, I married a man who had a similar point of view on this question.  My husband and I have owned this decision, with no regrets, at least not so far.<BR><BR>Of course, many people, including relatives, have questioned our decision not to have children. Some have even said that it was “selfish” of me not to have children. My question is, selfish with respect to whom?  A potential human being, who does not exist?  <BR><BR>Or perhaps they resent me depriving them of the right to visit with and enjoy my children, and perhaps if they think that through, they will see they are the ones being selfish, wanting me to decide to bring a human being into this world solely to gratify their emotional needs.  <BR><BR>Some men and women choose childbirth with joy, and I applaud them.  But not every woman is destined to be a good mother.  <BR><BR>I also don’t believe that child-birth is the “natural” course for women, i.e., that it should be the norm or that refraining from doing it should be considered deviant.  <BR><BR>But in order for it to be a choice as opposed to an accident or a mere matter of course, women, especially young women, need to have easy, judgment-free access to birth control, so that they can decide whether to reproduce and when.<BR><BR>Women’s choices must be respected, whichever way they decide, as long as the decision is right for them, and right for their children.  <BR><BR>Of course, not everything in life can be planned, but if our goal as a society is to prevent needless suffering, we should exercise control and choose our paths wisely.  <BR><BR>Unfortunately, young people become able to bear children before they become wise, and so they need guidance from their elders and from society at large.  <BR><BR>We must encourage them to take control of their own lives, and we must make birth control options freely available so that in the event that moral instruction about abstaining from sex doesn’t “take,” at least their lives are not shattered by an early unplanned pregnancy, which may well make it impossible for them to raise themselves out of poverty by completing their education.  <BR><BR>Women’s choices should be respected, and child-rearing should be a choice, not an obligation or an accident.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>One time we went to a restaurant and when I looked at the menu, there were a lot of choices.  Under chicken, there were four choices.  Under pork there were six choices. Then there was seafood.  When I decided to order a steak, I was asked how I want the steak cooked.  Then I was asked whether I would like soup or salad to go with it.  When I decided for the salad, I was asked what kind of dressing I want with it. And then I ordered a drink. I was asked to choose what kind I want, and whether I want it in a bottle, can or in a glass, whether I want ice with it or not.  Choices.<br><br>I think you agree with me that you and I are continually making choices daily.  Some of them are very minor choices. Think of all the choices you made getting ready for church this morning. What kind of dress or shirt will you wear? What kind of shoes will you wear? Are you going to attend the 6:30 worship or the 9am, or the 4pm, or the 5:30 worship?   <br><br>Some choices are really not choices at all.  In a plane flight, the flight attendant announced luncheon choices: chicken marengo or beef burritos. After announcing these choices, she added this useful piece of advice: “If you do not get your first choice, please do not be distressed, as all our entrees taste very much the same.” <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">     There was this man who went to see the Hopi Indians perform ceremonial dances.  It was a long lonely drive to the reservation across a secluded desert terrain, and the last 65 miles of it was over very rough roads.  Late afternoon after the dances, the man returned to his car only to discover he had a flat tire. To make matters worse, he had no spare tire in his trunk. But he remembered seeing a lone service station about five miles back down the road.  After getting a ride to the service station, he found the elderly proprietor sitting in a chair, drinking.  The stranded man asked, “Excuse me, sir, but do you fix flat tires?” The proprietor said, “Yep.”  So the man asked, “How much do you charge?”  The proprietor replied, “What difference does it make?” Obviously, the man was in no position to bargain. It was the only establishment for 65 miles that will fix a flat tire.</span><br><br>Then, of course, there are those life-changing choices.  Like “will I go to college or not?” Or “what university do I want to go to?” Or “is this the right woman or man for my spouse?”  Or “is this the job  I want to have for the rest of my life?”<br><br>In the Scripture where Moses was saying concluding words to the Israelites as they were finally about to enter into the Long-Promised Land,  they were asked to make a choice: will they choose life?  Or will they choose death?   Moses’ final words urged the people to do nothing less than “choose life”.  <br><br>Deuteronomy is the last book of the Torah, the five books of Law and Covenant in the Hebrew scriptures.  But Deuteronomy is the first book of the Torah to speak of a loving God, and a God who invites our love.  You might even call Deuteronomy as God’s first Valentine card.  <br><br>Choosing life, choosing obedience to God means choosing Love.  Love for “the Lord your God,” love for life, love for each other, love for all creation stand as “witnesses” to this new covenant.  The “witnesses” Moses “called” to formalize this covenant were “heaven and earth” — which makes the requirement to “love” about as widespread as it can get.<br><br>The “chosenness” of God’s covenanted people had nothing to do with their own worthiness, and everything to do with God’s unmerited love and commitment to the people of God’s creation.  God chose to enter into a ridiculous relationship with the fractured, fragmented human creatures of his creation. <br><br>Why?  Out of love.  All we have to do is love back.  That is how we “choose life”.<br><br>Our consumer culture says that our identity is found in the choices we make, the brands we buy, the clothes we wear.  On the other hand, the Bible tells us that our identity is not found in our choices but in your “chosenness.”  <br><br>God tells us, “You did not choose me: I chose you.”  And because we have been chosen, we can be secure in who we are.  <br><br>Our Valentine’s card in Deuteronomy tells us that even though we keep getting everything all wrong, God always keeps everything all right.  <br><br>And finally, in the New Testament we are told that Jesus had taken away the barrier that kept love from being more than a Valentine.  We have been offered life and love.  And it is this life of love which we are to announce to the world.  It is revealed through God’s chosen servants like you and me.<br><br>We are called to choose life by not seeking our safety and security, but in risking ourselves for those in need. <br><br>We choose life by not withholding ourselves from other people; instead, by giving of ourselves to others as we live among people. <br><br>We choose life when we speak the truth in a world of falsehood, regardless of the cost. <br><br>We choose life when we love God by doing justice, loving kindness, and walking humbly with our God. <br><br>We choose life when we share our bread with the hungry, and give shelter to the homeless.  <br><br>We choose life when we obey the commandments of God, the statutes and ordinances which the Lord has spoken and walk in the ways of the Lord God. <br><br>In choosing life, we obey the command of God to love the Lord with the totality of our lives in every day of our lives.<br><br>The call to choose life promises us that we shall live in a world free from hatred and contempt, lusting and lies, a world into which God in Christ continually calls us, and for which God’s love liberates us and empowers our obedience.  <br><br>It may cost friendship, destroy peace of mind, and lay upon us new and unwanted responsibilities. But God calls us not to remain neutral.<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A woman who was a member of the church where I served several years ago was crippled by arthritis that she had to be in a special wheelchair. She told me she was in pain most of the time.  She was in and out of the hospital.  Against the advice of her doctor, she would come to church with her family every Sunday if she was not in the hospital.  She said that she may not be able to walk, but she feels better if she can be with others to worship God.  All the members of the church, upon seeing her on Sundays were also encouraged. They said, if she can come to Church, there was no reason for them not to.  She wrote letters and sent cards to visitors of the church, welcoming them to our worship. She volunteered to answer the phone in the office if the secretary was not in the office.  Every Christmas, she sent cards to members of the church.  Whenever there were activities of the church, she might not be able to physically do anything, but she was there to encourage others. When people visited her in the hospital, they  would feel that instead of ministering to her, she was  ministering to them. That lady in a wheel chair with a bent body had made a choice.  She chose life because she was who she was, chosen by God to love others as she loved God.</span><br><br>You and I are God’s people because of the gracious love of God in Christ Jesus that has been poured into our lives in baptism. We are fed and forgiven when we come to worship, when we come to study together, or when we come at the Lord’s Table.  We belong to the community of God’s people in which we are loved and nurtured. <br><br>Because God has loved us so deeply and dearly, we can choose life rather than death.  We can be obedient in every day of our lives, as God calls us to choose faithfulness and service to God and to others in need.  Our tomorrow hinges on the choices we make.  Thus, my prayer is that we choose life.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Out came three sons from this union, three giants, as my parents refer to us, ‘cause we three are way taller than our Dad. <br><br>The girl from up north is Maripol Rotea, my Mama, a woman with spunk, a loving mom, an entrepreneur (also a CPA), and  now  just recently, a champion runner! She is one of the founding members of  the Dumaguete Amateur Roadrunners & Striders (DARS).  She finished first in her category in the Run 4 ur Heart race held  Feb. 20. <br><br>Before running became part of her routine, my mom briskwalked at the Perdices oval  almost every morning (five to six days a week) for three years.  So, shifting to running was easy for her, landing always first or second in her category in three of the races she has joined so far.<br><br>The Mindanaoan guy from down south is my Dad, Albert Tecson, also an entrepreneur, managing Derm Corner, a one-stop beauty shop (skincare clinic, retail, and hair salon). As far as I could recall, my Dad loves to eat veggies and fish. Nothing fried for him; he prefers only broiled or boiled.<br><br>We, the giants, were brought up to be temperate in our wants, and to focus more on our basic needs as persons. As part of my parents’ drive to keep us in control with ourselves, “fitness laws” were ordained. <br><br>We were to strive, in our best powers, to eat healthy. My Mom just shared to us at the dinner table while eating wheat pasta and fresh salad that in children’s parties we attended when we were still toddlers, they used to add a little water to our softdrinks before letting us drink it. This was one of the first of these “laws”. <br><br>The efforts toward health and fitness as part of right living was always afire in the family: the fitness laws go way back. I remember it clearest in my early elementary years when my classmates would go and carefree-ly eat Chippy, Nutri-Star, Sweet Corn balls, and Mr. Chips. But we, the Tecson brothers, were “outlawed” from doing the same. <br><br>That didn’t mean we never ate junk food though, but nevertheless, we ate less of it than most, saving us from too much salt and preservatives.<br><br>My own fitness story is a colorful adventure all on its own. Armed with my helmet and flip-flops, I started with mountain biking. Not only was it fun; it also was very therapeutic. Eventually, I was able to work out at the gym, hike across hills, do some muay thai, even dance the Hip-Hop Abs.<br><br>All of this, started with a choice: to eat a balanced diet, live healthy lives, to live happy lives, together as a family. We are the Tecson family and we  have chosen fitness to be our friend. <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">(Emmanuel “Dudz” Rotea Tecson)</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><div id=\"disqus_thread\"></div><br><br><script type=\"text/javascript\"><br><br>    /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */<br><br>    var disqus_shortname = 'Metropost'; // required: replace example with your forum shortname<br><br><br><br>    // The following are highly recommended additional parameters.

Seawater invaded farmlands, bringing with it houses, trucks, boats, and cars that lay in its path.<BR><BR>The damage to lives and property could have been higher if not for Japanâ€™s disaster preparedness program. <BR><BR>Japanese, like Filipinos, live in constant danger of being victims of natural calamities. Both our countries are in the Pacific Ring of Fire, and while we do not wish for such a tragedy to befall us, that is a constant possibility that hangs over our heads.<BR><BR>That is why our disaster management officials should not miss a beat to educate our people about the need to be ready for natural calamities. This is a learning opportunity because the people are so aware of the tragedy that has happened to a neighboring country. This is a message that could strike so close to home for millions of Filipinos.<BR><BR>Here in Negros Oriental, we can do our part by identifying potential threats to our communities and prepare for them. Weâ€™re not even talking about putting up big projects like evacuation centers. <BR><BR>Big things start small. Encouraging our people to have their own emergency kits would be a good start.

   "url": "invasive-alien-animal-species-p1110-98.htm",
   "body": "<BR><BR>Invasive alien animal species that have been intentionally or accidentally introduced into freshwater ecosystems are proving to be harmful to the native species and/or the environment in a number of ways. <BR><BR>The reason for this could be the wide tolerance of these species to environmental factors, in contrast to that of endemic species which have adapted to narrow ranges of these factors in their habitats. Endemic species would, therefore, lose out to the invaders because they could not compete or they are preyed upon.  <BR><BR>It seems that no government body is in charge of the problem of invasive species. The Protected Areas & Wildlife Bureau of the Department of Environment, and the Bureau of Fisheries have yet to grapple with the problem of introduced alien species, which has been recognized by biodiversity experts as a threat to the native and endemic biodiversity of a country. <BR><BR>This lack of attention is not acceptable at this time when nations of the world are aware of the importance of biodiversity. <BR><BR>Here in the Philippines, we have just celebrated the Year of Biodiversity (2010) with an international conference held on Feb. 1-3, 2011. There is big gap between what government says and what it does. <BR><BR>What seems to make matters worse is that the newspapers are ahead in pointing out to our people the perils of harmful introductions of alien species that most likely will turn out to be invasive. <BR><BR>For example, our authorities have been silent on harmful fish introductions, instead of taking the lead in explaining why these events are happening.<BR><BR>A case in point is the article in the Thursday issue of the Philippine Daily Inquirer (March 10, 2011) which featured the janitor fish from South America that threatens to have a serious ecological impact on our freshwater ecosystems through competition in space and food, as well through predation on the eggs and larvae of our native fishes. <BR><BR>And this is only one of the several harmful alien species in the country. <BR><BR>It will be recalled that the country lost 15 of the 18 species of endemic cyprinids in Lake Lanao during the 20th century, most probably through competition with and predation by two marine gobies introduced into the lake most probably by a government agency. <BR><BR>If true, it  indicates  a  serious lack of understanding of the perils of alien species introduction.<BR><BR>What is needed at this time is a research program to determine the actual occurrence and distribution in the country of the janitor fish, as well as other alien species. <BR><BR>Our recent studies on rivers have shown that this species and eight other species are found in the Bago River in Negros Occidental. Nine alien fish species are also found in the Jalaur river in Iloilo province. Seven of these nine species are common to both rivers. Their effects could be disastrous in the future. It is possible that several alien fish species have invaded many of our rivers and other freshwater ecosystems. We know for example that the janitor fish occurs in Laguna Lake.<BR><BR>The second thing to do is to establish a program to eradicate the janitor fish and other introduced aquatic species (including frogs) found in our natural environment. The PAWB should be responsible for this program in cooperation with other government agencies. <BR><BR>Another action would be to determine who among the aquarium fish dealers (as alleged by the Inquirer) had a hand in its introduction into the wild. Such irresponsible behavior should be sanctioned.  Maybe, the Foundation for the Philippine Environment, a funding agency tasked to deal with biodiversity, should lead in this investigation.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Plain and simple: to uphold the laws of the Republic and uphold the Constitution. <br><br>The Constitution provides: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The President, Vice President, members of the Supreme Court, members of Constitutional Commissions, and the Ombudsman may be removed from office, on impeachment for, and conviction of, culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, and other high crimes, or betrayal of public trustx x x.â€</span> (Sec 2, Art. XI, 1987 Constitution).<br><br>As expressed by Justice Malcolm: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">â€œThe basic idea of government in the Philippines is that of a representative government, the officers being mere agents and not rulers of the people, one where no one man or set of men have proprietary or contractual  rights to an office, but where every officer accepts office pursuant to the provisions of law, and holds the office as a trust for the people whom he represents.â€</span><br><br>The  Motion on the table was: â€œWhether or not there is enough ground to engender a well-founded belief that an impeachable offense such as betrayal of public trust had been committed by the Ombudsman, and should she be held for trial?â€<br><br>In answer, Cong. Josy Limkaichong said: â€œYes!â€,  with her clear voice full of conviction, she had done her constitutional duty for the people of the 1st District of Negros Oriental to have their voices heard,  and together with 39 other congressmen, by majority vote, the Articles of  Impeachment will be drafted and presented to the House, within 60 days, and which will be calendared within 10 days from receipt.<br><br>After consideration, at least one third vote of all the members of the House shall be necessary to forward the impeachment to the Senate.<br><br>The new majority led by Rep. Neil Tupas as chair of the Liberal Party has the numbers; the new minority led by Rep. Edcel Lagman (Lakas-Kampi), tried their best to block/delay the vote. <br><br>This is a reversal of fortunes because now, the impeachment complaint had prospered, while in the previous Congress, Lagman  and his allies had the numbers to junk complaints. The tables have now turned.<br><br>There  is a system of check-and-balance because we have the People Power  Constitution,  the fundamental law of the land.

   "body": "<BR><BR>DAVAO CITY --  Today as I write is Ash Wednesday. As per tradition, I went to church this morning for the services and had my forehead smudged with ash. And once more, the grim reminder: â€œRemember, man, thou art dust.â€<BR><BR>When I was younger, I dreaded the season of Lent and all the forced sacrifice it entailed. Abstinence on Fridays (oh those delicious hotdogs!) and fasting, too. I remember one Good Friday how I waited for midnight so I could raid the fridge for a piece of chocolate I had been eying. I think I missed the deadline by five minutes. So much for self-control.<BR><BR>And now that Iâ€™m older? I canâ€™t say for sure whether itâ€™s gotten easier or harder. Instead with age has come a greater appreciation of Lent and what it signifies. Itâ€™s not sacrifice for sacrificeâ€™s sake, but as preparation for the Easter that is to come.<BR><BR>Rather than suffering through the season, Iâ€™ve come to treat Lent as a long game of forty innings. Each day a goal, and at the end of it, the assessment: did I win today? what could I have done better? how am I going to play this tomorrow? In the end, will I come out of Lent a better person than when I came in?<BR><BR>By way of self-improvement, Lent comes at a most opportune time, some three months after the New Year. By now, New Yearâ€™s resolutions will have been forgotten, or given up on. Lent is the perfect time to revisit those goals and start on them anew. Unlike resolutions in the New Year which have no time frame, resolutions in Lent have a definite deadline. <BR><BR>I like to think that as Iâ€™ve matured, Iâ€™ve become more self-aware -- of my faults and of my weaknesses. More often than not, these faults and weaknesses stem from complacency and self-love. So what more fitting way to celebrate Lent than to offer up little sacrifices that aim at how I can be a better man?<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>First of all, hereâ€™s a test on how â€œrapidâ€ Task Force SAGARR (Special Action Group Advocating for Rapid Reform) will act on this concern: The walking lane at the Rizal Blvd is covered with dirt and dust. Itâ€™s time to bring in the firetrucks and give the area a complete wash-over. Give it a little shine to make promenading and walking a pleasant pastime. Knowing him to be an action man, City Administrator William Ablong, ground commander of the Task Force, will surely attend to this concern with dispatch.<BR><BR>Still on the subject of walking, the Quarter Marathon Wellness Walk, with Mayor Chiquiting Sagarbarria, leading a thousand walkers, was successfully staged Sunday, March 6. <BR><BR>The event is a wellness project of the FU Institute of Youth Sports for Peace, undertaken with the corporate support of Robinsons-Dumaguete, the Dumaguete Business Park Inc, and Jollibee. We thank Naddie May Orillana of Robinsons, local businessman-sportsman cum philanthropist Julio Sy, Jr., and Jollibee-Robinsons manager Marlyn Vendiola for extending to us full support, since we launched the project last year.<BR><BR>Negros Oriental, and for that matter, the City of Dumaguete, having the dubious distinction of being the â€œMotorcycle of the Philippinesâ€, could very well face the health-risk and environmental hazards that this fact poses. Riding motorcycles and minimal use of the legs for physical activity could be the precursor to lifestyle diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, heart problems, osteoporosis and a host of other maladies. <BR><BR>As I am writing this piece, a news flash on TV reports that the incidence of obesity among Filipinos is now at an alarming level of 33.45 percent. Thatâ€™s about one-third of the Philippine population of 97,976,603. It could even be higher among the motorcycling people of Negros Oriental. This is the reason I submit this proposal for the members of the City Council to consider.<BR><BR>Back in the early 1980s, I was secretary-general of the Marathon Association of the Philippines based in Manila. In our desire to promote running, we lobbied for and secured the issuance of an ordinance which prescribed the closing of traffic in the whole stretch of Roxas Blvdâ€”from the CCP Complex up to the Manila Hotel. Under the Ordinance, no vehicle may enter the area on Sunday mornings from 5 to to 8 a.m. For three hours, hundreds of walkers and runners could be seen in that stretch of Roxas Blvd, taking advantage of the opportunity to indulge in joyful physical activity.<BR><BR>A similar ordinance could be issued by the Dumaguete City Council, prescribing that the stretch of the Rizal Blvd -- from the Press Club upto Don Atilano -- be closed to vehicular traffic for three hours on Sunday mornings from 5 to 8 a.m. <BR><BR>It should be noted that because of the current wellness and running boom world-wide, many visitors and tourists are fitness buffs who would find the area an ideal place to walk or run, or simply promenade and imbibe the fresh morning air of the sea.<BR><BR>Thus, early on Sunday mornings, the Rizal Blvd will be a haven for walkers, runners and fitness enthusiastsâ€”transforming Dumaguete City into an interesting contrast where the motorcycle capital is also the walking capital of the Philippines.<BR><BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/WellnessWalk.jpg\"><BR>Mayor Chiquiting Sagarbarria joins the Quarter Marathon Wellness walkers at dawn.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Iâ€™m certainly not a tourist. I have lived and worked  here long enough to be intimate with its people and its daily life.

Iâ€™m close enough to be a part of life here, and at the same time Iâ€™m distant enough to see things around me that others might be unaware of-  and I hope that this viewpoint can be of some value for those who read this column.

I resented being made to stay at the corner.  But because I knew that there was nothing I could do about her decision, I begrudgingly obeyed. I was bored facing the wall with nothing to see or do.  I had to get out of that corner fast.  In desperation I would pray asking God to help me.  I asked forgiveness for the wrong I have done.  In those instances when I thought my Mom was wrong or unfair, I would ask God to enlighten my Mom to make her appreciate the situation in another way.  Most of all, I prayed to God to help soften my Momâ€™s heart and take her out of her punishing mood.   I knew that my prayer would be heard.  After a while, my Mom would come and tell me to stand up.  She would hug me and give me some ice cream or some pop which was a luxury drink for us at that time.<br> <br>Psalm 107 was a reading we shared in one of my Confirmation classes.  I shared my experience and the rest gave their share of story. Kids no longer receive the kind of punishment we had when the iron-hand was an acceptable form of punishment.  We now use the term â€œgroundedâ€ when a parent takes away a privilege from a child for their misbehavior.<br> <br>One girl shared that she was grounded for a week.  No going out to friendâ€™s house and no visiting from friends.  She was bored.  She decided to read her Bible and randomly picked Psalm 107.  It spoke to her.  I asked her what message she received from that reading.  She replied, â€œIt you pray and ask Godâ€™s help, He will answer.â€  I surmised that receiving Godâ€™s assurance through the written Word calmed her spirits and assured her that God loved her and was there with her and for her.  Through the inspiration and guidance from Holy Spirit, this girl was able to write a poem and an essay.  Moreover, she was filled with peace and joy in the Lord.  She came out of being grounded a refined vessel.<br> <br>If this girl was blessed, I was doubly blessed!  Godâ€™s steadfast love for me was manifested through my confirmation class.  God continues to work in us, through us, and with us.  Praise God!<br> <br>If we think that when we  are in a crisis or in an unpleasant situation,  we think that we are on fire and we want to get out of that situation.  We do not realize that our low and disappointing moments are  times we can call â€œrefined by fireâ€ moments.  When we come out of an unpleasant circumstance and are proactive about it, Godâ€™s love manifests in us and we do become better persons.  We are â€œrefinedâ€ as fire refines gold.<br> <br>There are times in our lives when we bear the consequences of our decisions because of our feelings of self-sufficiency.  But those whose lives center on God totally depend on His mercy, love and compassion.  How can we live without God in our lives?  We cannot.  If we do not seek God, God seeks us.  Godâ€™s love for us is constant and steadfast.  God is our Deliverer, our Redeemer, our Healer, our Savior and our Guide.  Godâ€™s steadfast love is manifested to us when we are reminded of the cross where Jesus died for us.<br><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Rose Marie Calderon-Khan</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

They teach in the areas of painting, photography, sculpture, and animation. <br><br>Takeshi Maruyama, a renowned Japanese artist and a visiting lecturer, has been sharing his knowledge, skills and artistic talent with the students.<br><br>The Department offers ArchiCAD, a leading architectural design software that is used in the internationally, as part of BS Architecture curriculum. <br><br>The students are required to provide their own laptops to design projects in their Architectural Design class ranging from simple to complex structures such as hospitals, beach resorts, hotel complexes, schools, bus terminals, churches, commercial banks, condominiums, airports, residential subdivisions, and public markets. <br><br>One of the several projects of the Department is to document existing streetscapes according to its architectural style along Perdices St., Locsin St., Dr. Miciano Road, and Rizal Boulevard. <br><br>Design presentations are held every semester before a jury of prominent personalities in the community to judge the designs of the students in the areas of conceptualization, site organization, planning and layout, interior spatial organization, exterior volumetric composition, sustainable design applications, aesthetic applications, elements of composition and drafting skills. <br><br>Moreover, exhibits that showcase the studentsâ€™ works such as scale models, digital works, painting, photos and sculptures are scheduled at the end of each semester, called  <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Project Uno</span>, which is usually staged at Robinsons Mall.<br><br>To be globally competitive, students are encouraged to express their ideas effectively and creatively and to think critically. <br><br>An <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Esquisse</span> (French for â€œsketchâ€) is staged three times a year, which recently came in the form of the Sandcastle Contest and the Pumpkin Carving Contest, where the design skills of the students are pitted against each other.<br><br>Architecture students are also required to design and create their own personalized workstations out of indigenous materials. <br><br>Ma. Zharysse Barona, a 4th year architecture student, remarked about her experience, â€œIt was challenging and difficult, but it was fun and satisfying especially when you behold your own creationâ€. <br><br>Starting June 2011, 3rd year students will undergo additional training in building techniques to prepare them for the â€œRural Studioâ€ project.  <br><br>The Rural Studio is an extension program established by the late Samuel Mockbee at Auburn University.  The essence is to select, design, and build a home for indigent families in the Province at no cost to these families.  Students will provide the labor, and the University will enlist donations for the building materials.<br><br>The Department offers Summer Art Workshops such as Basic Drawing, Basic Painting, Photography, Animation, Sculpture, and Pottery Making. These are open to kids five years old and above. <br><br>It also offers ArchiCAD course for students and professionals.<br><br>Graduates of BS Architecture can find themselves in architectural firms, construction companies, or their own private practice as architects. <br><br>Bachelor of Fine Arts graduates can have a career in computer graphics, advertising, animation, art education, and industrial design.    <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Griezl Bation</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Foundation University </span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Dust  returns  to dust, is one of  the dayâ€™s overarching themes. â€œDeath  plucks my ears and  says: Live â€” I am coming,â€ Justice Oliver Wendell  Holmes  wrote  on his 90th  birthday.<br><br>Ashes will be traced tomorrow, in the form of a cross,  on the forehead of President  Benigno  Aquino, on those whoâ€™ll  never be president, thieves in  costly barongs  to  beggars we half  see. In  a society  where  over 4.3 million scrounge  below poverty thresholds, they  blend into the woodwork.<br><br>â€œYour friend died last night, â€ a panhandler  lisped to the wife as we walked by. Periodically, the wife would  hand him some rice, coins, or gaudy T-shirts  we cringed to wear. Chronic hunger shriveled him into a  scrawny man with a gap-toothed smile. â€œWe never learned his name,â€ the wife murmured.<br><br>Tomorrowâ€™s  ashes come from burnt Palm Sunday 2010  fronds. With  oil of the catechumen, ashes  are stirred into a paste. As  priest or lay minister  traces  the cross on foreheads. He  then reaches across the centuries  to echo a shattering  sentence  first heard  in an Eden marred  by disobedience: â€œRemember,  man, that you are dust. And unto dust you shall return.â€<br><br>Wednesdayâ€™s rites  remind us of two friends: a young lieutenant  and an equally-young political activist. They never met. But  their paths  crossed  briefly at the boarding gate for â€œMount Pinatuboâ€, President   Ramon  Magsaysayâ€™s   plane.<br><br>This was midnight of  March 17, 54 years back.  Jesus Rama, younger   brother of journalist  Napoleon  Rama,  came  to Cebuâ€™s  Lahug airport to  see  the President off. Standing in that same crowd  was  Lt  Julian Ares, then  aide-de-camp to Gen Cornelio  Bondad. Both were to fly with the President to Manila.<br><br>As  Magsaysay  strode towards the ramp, he spotted  Rama. â€œJess,â€ he said clasping arms around Rama, â€œCome with me to Manila.â€  Rama, who  had a phobia for flying, pulled back. Friends tut-tutted  Rama, advising him: â€œJust  accommodate the President, Jess.â€ Reluctantly, Rama  climbed aboard.<br><br>â€œAt Mt. Pinatuboâ€™s  door, presidential aide-de-camp Lt. Leopoldo Regis supervised loading,â€ Ares recalls from his Chicago retirement  home. â€œPresident Magsaysay was already aboard.â€<br><br>But at a Club Filipino rally, the President asked Sen. Tomas Cabili and Cebu Cong. Pedro Lopez: â€œJoin me.â€ The planeâ€™s engines  idled until  Cabili and Lopez hurried aboard.<br><br>â€œSorry, sir, we must  leave you behind,â€ Lt. Regis apologetically said to the General.  <br><br>â€œBondadâ€™s  satchel and mine were tossed off the planeâ€. The door slammed  shut. And  the reconfigured C47 took off --  only  to slam into Mt Mannungal  20 minutes later. <br><br>Toiling half way up Mt. Mannungal the next day,  Aresâ€™ search party  met villagers  hefting  a hammock.  In it was  the only  survivor: Nestor Mata of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Philippines Herald</span>.  Aresâ€™  team was also the first to reach the still-smouldering  wreckage and human ashes  just as the sun set.<br><br>â€œPresume not to promise yourself the next morning,â€ Thomas aâ€™ Kempis counseled. And in the morning, consider  that you may not live till nightfall... Many die when they least  think of it... A man is here today. And tomorrow, he is gone. And when he is taken out of sight, he is also quickly out of mind.â€<br><br>Ash Wednesdayâ€™s  counsel is imparted  without discrimination: generals who  creamed off  armed forces funds,  pliable justices and ombudsmen, jueteng overlords,  even former presidents, who ward off trial while bunkered  behind squads of midnight  appointees.<br><br>This sacramental signals  the start of the penitential  season of Lent. Fasting for  renewal is shared by major faiths. Muslims observe Ramadan. Hindus and Buddhists set aside days for fasting. Jews fast on Yom Kippur. Like Catholics, Anglicans designate Lent as a penitential  season.<br><br>By the 8th century, Day of  Ashes rites had become common in the church. But the use of ashes goes way back. â€œI heard of Thee by hearing of the ear. But now, mine eye seeth Thee,â€ says an anguished Job to the Voice from the whirlwind. â€œWherefore, I... repent in dust and ashes.â€ <br><br>Imelda Marcos receives, in all sincerity, ashes on Wednesday. On Thursday, she  scoffs  at the US  Federal Courtâ€™s  decision that found the  Marcos regime â€œliable for torture, summary executions and disappearancesâ€. It  awarded 7,526 victims token $1,000 checks from the ill-gotten loot.<br><br>The class suit â€œturned into a business,â€ Imelda sneered. â€œYou spit on the blood of thousands who died for freedom,â€ snapped <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">  Inquirer</span>â€™s Ma. Ceres Doyo, a martial law victim. â€œYou have no shame.â€ The English translation loses the Tagalog pungency. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sayang</span>...<br><br> Those smeared foreheads mean three things, writes   Jesuit Fr. Danny Huang in an earlier  paper: â€œWriting in the Dustâ€.  We confess. We promise. We hope.<br><br>We live in dark times: from the Maguindanao murders, abortions to massive theft. The ashes acknowledge that in the end, itâ€™s not the fault of  MILF, Abu Sayyaf or Al Qaeda. It is our fault. Cruelty to utter self-preoccupation in our hearts, produce bitter fruits.  We must face the truth of ourselves and  refuse to practice our Filipino expertise in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">palusot</span>.<br><br>With  fasting, almsgiving and prayer, we pledge to move beyond suffocating self-absorption to compassion. We must not  remain paralyzed by  self-pitying powerlessness. <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Ganito na talaga ako. Di ko na kayang magbago,</span> it says. Instead, â€œwe move on, one small faltering, but real step at a time.â€<br><br>Third, we hope.â€œ We know that the world is not changed by the brute force of arms but by the power of those whose spirits are made new.â€ Thatâ€™s what those smudged foreheads  mean.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Josie Antonio, comprise the executive committee of the City Development Council. They were invited supposedly to explain why the City Council had passed a measure appropriating P2.7 million to construct an Environment Training Center despite the absence of a program of work.<br><br>Cordova told the Dumaguete MetroPost during a recess that he was caught unaware that his office had sent out invitations to the Mayor and two councilors to appear during the Councilâ€˜s Question Hour that day and explain the reason for the action of the Council.<br><br>â€œIf it is our intention to be respected as an institution, let us show respect. We cannot make [the chief executive] suffer the indignity of attending a session to explain his actions,â€œ Cordova said.<br><br>Cordova crossed over to Sagarbarriaâ€˜s office to offer the City Councilâ€˜s apology, which Sagarbarria accepted.<br><br>The issue came about after the City Council passed an Ordinance on Feb. 3 to allocate P2,796,571.90 to convert the south side of the second floor of City Hall into an Environment Training Center. The money was to be taken from the savings or unobligated balance, of previous allocations made for public works projects.<br><br>Councilor Joe Ken Arbas, who along with Councilors Antonio Remollo and Manuel Arbon, wanted to invite the Mayor and the other CDC executive committee members to appear in the session, said it was not their intention to undo the Ordinance. He said they merely wanted to be enlightened as to why there are no supporting documents.<br><br>Mayor Sagarbarria, meanwhile, said the CDC asked the City Council to appropriate the amount of P2.7 million for the Environment Training Center not because they already made detailed estimates for the project, but simply because that was the only money available at that time from the Cityâ€˜s savings.<br><br>Sagarbarria said now that the money is allocated, they could make a program of work that will suit the appropriated budget.<br><br>Taking a potshot at the three councilors, Sagarbarria said the problem is they do not know their job [as legislators]. â€œThey [seem to] want to do my job,â€ the Mayor said.<br><br>Following the faux pas, Arbas said the Council will still invite the other members of the CDC Executive Committee for the next session, minus the politicians.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Luisa Suites Inn.<BR><BR>Of the total 689 arrested drug couriers, 431 are females due to the assumption that women will draw lesser suspicion from authorities while 89 are already facing death penalty conviction. <BR><BR>PDEAâ€™s records show that a group known as West African Drug Syndicate is behind the alarming increase of Filipino women arrested as drug couriers or â€œdrug mules.â€<BR><BR>Most of these women were recruited either thru casual acquaintances or online chatrooms where the victims are lured by foreigners  to visit them abroad, pay for their airfares and accommodations as long as they bring a certain package with them which would turn out to contain illegal drugs. <BR><BR>Also susceptible are overstaying OFWs whose working visas are about to expire. â€œThe syndicates with their Filipi co-horts would approach these OFWs and offer them jobs and money as much as $2,000 for every successful delivery and pay for their plane tickets,â€ said Oledan.<BR><BR>The couriers are then instructed to swallow latex balloons or capsules containing either heroine, cocaine or shabu which the courier would flush out from his body thru defecation upon arrival at his destination, a risky practice known as body packing or body stuffing.<BR><BR>â€œThis is very dangerous for the courier as the capsule can burst or leak inside the body and cause drug overdose which can lead to death,â€ warned Oledan. <BR><BR>Aside from drug ingestion, other methods of drug mules are hiding drugs inside suitcases or luggages, inside chutes, strapping them to oneâ€™s body, or placing them inside books, bottles and parcels. <BR><BR>Each year, 50 Filipinos are recruited into the drug mule trade by one recruiter alone. <BR><BR>Majority of the arrested Filipino drug mules claim that they had no knowledge of the illegal drugs they were carrying.<BR><BR>â€œFilipinos are known to be hospitable and will easily accommodate requests to bring packages from other people when they go home or abroad without bothering to find out whatâ€™s inside the package,â€ added Oledan. <BR><BR>Although none of the arrested Filipino drug couriers come from Negros Oriental, Oledan said that the local security forces as well as the community should remain vigilant against drug trafficking.

There is certainly great restlessness all around the world and this restlessness is shaking us to our very core.  The conclusion is crystal clear - - - we are losing control.  We are coming to terms with the most frightening but perhaps, the most liberating truth of all - - - that we are truly powerless and ever in need of a kind of security that is not of this world  - - - a security that only the Lord can give.  Recent global events are way too powerful to ignore.  When you see an entire island ravaged by a catastrophic tsunami; stately buildings crumbling down in seconds; frightened faces of evacuees from war-torn nations; and public officials who have no sense of shame for their insatiable greed, you cannot help but feel beleaguered.  It is a kind of experience that leaves you feeling naked and wholly helpless. <br><br> There are no words for these kinds of moments.  You can only pause in humility and deep reverence before the only One who stands strong and secure.  Now, more than ever before, the Lord is inviting us to listen to his voice - - - to wake up from our slumber - - - and to make peace with him while there is time.  Somehow we all want to say that things will be better, but in our heart of hearts, we know that tougher days are ahead.  We cannot help but feel disheartened but we cannot also help but remain firm and steadfast in the Lord and in his word.  After all, where else can we go and to whom else can we run to? <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Let us pray.</span>  Let us beg God for mercy and help. Let us ask the Lord to awaken our sleepy hearts and give us the courage to embrace our utter dependence on his grace and forgiveness.  By prayer, I mean the restoration of holy fear towards God and the strengthening of our commitment to walk with him.  By prayer, I also mean, deeper fidelity to Godâ€™s agenda as we pursue what is just, merciful and kind - - - not when people are watching, but most importantly, when we are all by ourselves.   <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Let us process.</span>  Let us evaluate our priorities, our pursuits, and our passions.  Let us move away from the madness of it all.  Let us stop. Let us ask ourselves where our lives are truly headed and for what reasons are we living each day.   By process, I mean slowing down - - - giving ourselves time to breathe - - - to feel and to remember that we are not machines but we are people created to live for Godâ€™s ultimate purpose and glory. By process I also mean taking a few steps backward in order to see things from a fresh perspective; to value family and friends whose love for us is priceless; and to overcome our obsession for moments of pleasures that only lead us to a lifetime of defeat.  <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Let us purse.</span>  Let us put up a good fight.  Let us not hand ourselves over to the world on a silver platter.  If we have to fall or fail, let it be with utmost dignity on our part.  God forbid that our hearts harden or lose its fire! God forbid that we stop finding reasons to praise him, to celebrate his goodness and to be in reverent awe of Christ whose love for us is beyond words.   God forbid that we fail to see his awesome and profound beauty in the simplest of things. God forbid that we become cynical, contemptuous or despicable - - - or that we lose the purity of heart that will forever convince us that nothing can ever separate us from the relentless love of God in Christ Jesus.  May we all be as relentless!

In a way, I am struck dumb by it. It is not because the film is bad; it is because it is very good, and perhaps my flailing has every thing to do with a conscious effort to process whatever it is about this documentary that impresses me as a work of genius. It got to me. I <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">think</span> I understand it in a deeply emotional <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">and</span> intellectual level, but it finally comes to me as a treacherous Chinese box: a film of so many layers, that to penetrate one is just gaining entry to another layer that leads to other layers. It playfully winds itself in unexpected ways even as we unravel it. This is the multidimensionality of Christopher Nolanâ€™s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Inception</span> taken to the heart of the art world and given the attitude of a prankster. Why do I say that? Because in some maniacal level, the film also seems to mock me: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">So you pretend to get me, eh?</span> it says. What a pretentious ass you are. In many ways, that feeling is exactly like being a visitor to â€œBarely Legal,â€ Banksyâ€™s landmark exhibition of his street art in 2006, and getting a souvenir that says â€œI Canâ€™t Believe You Morons Actually Buy This Shit.â€<br><br>I love Banksyâ€™s E<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">xit Through the Gift Shop [2010] â€” </span>but the nagging question remains: what if what Iâ€™m buying is just â€œshit,â€ a high concept joke? No matter. Because, divorced from all other post-modern considerations, it is actually a sincere film that 1) documents quite well the street art scene, but also 2) gives a devastating illustration of how we â€” in an effort to be â€œinâ€ or to be part of â€œcoolâ€are easily taken in by so-called artists whose gifts may lie more in hype and personal showboating than in actual artistry. Pop Art has always been about skewering our unthinking allegiance to consumer culture. But in the ironic twist of eventually becoming part of that consuming culture it mocks <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">(galleries! agents! shows! modern art buyers!)</span>, the film shows it is much like seeing a snake eating its own tail.<br><br>Consider, for example, the scenes in this documentary where we get the ambush interviews of people who have just witnessed the unveiling of Mr. BrainWashâ€™s debut exhibit in Los Angeles. In context, we have just seen the mad hamminess of Mr. BrainWash, his â€œartistryâ€ nothing more than mere supervised scanning (by other people in his employ) and re-imaging (also by other people in his employ) of iconic works already out there. His works are derivative and uninspired, with none of the wit or the intelligence of the street artists he wants to emulate. (How many times can you rip off Warhol, put a Marilyn Monroe wig on everybody from Spock to Larry King, and still be considered somebody with something worthwhile to say?) But a careless banner story in the L.A. Weekly has already proclaimed him a new artist of grand reckoning â€”hype that Mr. BrainWash has engineered himself. And so what do we get from the eventual ambush interviews? Of people fawning, just because they have been â€œtoldâ€ to fawn. Most sputter something about the â€œgeniusâ€ they have just seen, with some quite unsure about the artistry of most of the works in exhibition yet stammering on to confused conclusions that these works do â€œsay somethingâ€ about contemporary culture. I realize: we are those people. We do buy shit, especially if itâ€™s wrapped in hype and is labeled â€œcool.â€<br><br>We are these people who see blatant mediocrity jazzed up in some ways in an exhibition (or in a film festival!) â€” and just because it just doesnâ€™t seem to run like the usual, we immediately proclaim it as a work of utter genius. (Alas, this is much the same way people lauded Francis X. Pasionâ€™s terrible <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Sampaguita</span>, a messy soup of a film from the poverty porn factory that sadly belied his success in Jay.)<br><br>Mr. BrainWash â€” <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">nom de guerre</span> of the (eventually) exasperating homunculus in the center of Banksyâ€™s many-layered documentary â€” is either a hoax or a living/breathing symptom of everything that is wrong about pop culture and our unthinking consumption of it. In real life, he is Thierry Guetta, a French transplant to Los Angeles and one-time vintage clothes retailer whose obsession with videotaping every minute of his life has somehow led him to become an unwitting â€œdocumentarianâ€ of street art, just as its popularity and mystique are exploding all over the worldâ€™s metropolitan centers. (Think New York, London, and Paris.) He was on the scene at the right time and the right place, his entry to this world being an accidental footage he captured of his cousin â€” the French street artist Invader â€” at work gluing characters from the computer game â€œSpace Invadersâ€ (made from colorful square tiles) all over the streets of Paris. This chance glimpse eventually leads to other street artists that Mr. Guetta eventually films â€” Seizer, Neck Face, Sweet Toof, Cyclops, Dotmasters, Swoon, Buffmonster, Monsieur AndrÃ©, Zevs, and Shepard Fairey â€” big names in this counter-culture art world that works in the shadows, always on the sly, always courting danger and legal wrangling. What fascinates us about them is that they give us works that, first of all, titillate because they work outside the normal structures of the so-called art world, but also because they are witty surprises in paint or stencil that take our ordinary physical world, and gives it a dimension that unnerves or amuses. Consider BanksyÃ¢â€™s infamous murdered phone booth in a London alley, or Ellis Gallagherâ€™s stenciled sneakers at play with shadows in New York...<br><br>One figure proves elusive, however: Banksy, the English street artist whose notoriety is exceeded only by both the unalloyed provocation of his genius and his preference to keep his identity (and process) hidden from public scrutiny. But a chance encounter eventually lets Banksy take in Mr. Guetta in confidence, allowing even the Frenchman to videotape him at work, citing the ephemeral nature of his art that cries for documentation. Itâ€™s graffiti, after all, and like most graffiti, theyâ€™re eventually effaced. The documentary, we are told, came about because of a challenge: Mr. Guetta has amassed years and years of footage, which he claims he is putting together into a documentary. Now the artists are wondering: when will the film be finished? Mr. Guetta hastily puts together a film he calls <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Life Remote Control</span>, an unwatchable mess that runs for more than an hour, clearly the work of a person who is not in any way a filmmaker. It is at this point, so we are told, that Banksy takes control of the footage, and turns it on Mr. Guetta. The film starts to take another direction as we follow Mr. Guetta try to become a street artist himself, but as somebody who wants to take the short cut and get right to the top â€” culminating in the aforementioned exhibit, his debut Los Angeles show called <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Life is Beautiful</span>. We are finally shown the process of how a small man â€” utterly talentless in every way but imbued with the implacable sense that he is, or can be, a real artist â€” can make it big in the modern art world, given hype and self-promotion.<br><br>That was painful to watch. I cringed, and cringed. It all seemed so familiar. Because how many people do we know who are exactly like Mr. BrainWash? People without an eye for composition, but call themselves photographers just because they have a DSLR or know how to Photoshop? People who have no concept of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">mise-en-scene</span>, but call themselves film directors because they happen to have a camera and a screenplay on standby? People who donâ€™t read, but call themselves poets because they have feelings they want to share and they can rhyme? People who have no idea of artistic space and functionality, but call themselves furniture designers because they can cobble wood into slightly interesting shapes? People who dress up in eccentric clothing, wear their hair in strange ways, and call themselves â€œartistesâ€ â€” but are without the slightest discipline to produce anything?<br><br>And of course, there are the people who lap all that bullshit up.<br><br>This documentary is a great meditation on that, and the artistic process â€” but at the same time, it also plays as a kind of mind game knowing Banksyâ€™s reputation as a prankster. Is this film for real? Is that hooded man even Banksy? In telling the story of Mr. BrainWash, is he giving us a deep look into the world of street art, or is he mocking us the viewers as the ultimate recipient of this joke?

One of the two is a brilliant detective. A police inspector drops by to seek their help. A thief has stolen a letter from an aristocratic woman.  If the thief were to expose the contents of the letter, the woman would be ruined. She knows who stole the letter. The woman asked the police inspector to retrieve the letter. In desperation, the inspector has come to the brilliant detective and his friend.</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The two men gave some suggestions. The inspector has examined every brick in the yard of the man’s apartment.  He has examined every furniture. He has turned each page of every book in the thief’s private library. But the inspector has come away empty-handed. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">A month later, the inspector returns to the apartment of the two friends if they have come up with any new ideas. The detective asks nonchalantly how much of a reward the inspector would offer for the recovery of the letter.  He blurts out the sum of 50,000 francs.  </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">With that offer on the table, the brilliant detective replies to the effect that he would like that amount in a check! He then hands the precious letter to the inspector. </span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">At first, the inspector is speechless, but then he stumbles out the door in what Poe calls, “a perfect agony of joy”. </span><br><br>The letter was where the detective had spied it on a previous visit: right out in plain sight. The thief had marked the letter up a bit, torn the envelope, put a few smudges on it, so that it looked like an ordinary letter to the unobservant eye.  Dupin recognized that the letter looked too worn, too dirty, compared with the other articles in the card rack where the thief had kept the letter. The letter had been there the whole time, but the inspector did not have eyes to see it.<br><br>In our gospel lesson, Jesus leads the three of his disciples up a high mountain. Just from making the climb, they know something is about to happen. And when they were there, Jesus’ face shone like the sun, and his clothes turned dazzling white. Moses and Elijah show up. The presence of Moses and Elijah meant that the law and the prophets were represented.  Even the cloud that surrounded the three startled disciples was a sign of God’s presence.  Here on this mountain, as terrified as they were, the three disciples saw all the evidence they needed that God was working through Jesus. God’s presence could not have been more obvious.<br><br>The impetuous Peter right away suggested that they build three huts for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah.  However, Jesus said, they have to go down the valley as there were people waiting for them.  <br><br>I think for most of us, we would like to experience the presence of God in our lives.  We envy people who tell us they had seen and talked with God. It is our prayer that God will come to us so we could also experience the exhilarating presence of God. Even if this vision of God terrifies us, it would be worth it, just to know that God is there, and what God wants from us.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">         I<br></div><br><br>        This passage tells us that we can experience God on the mountaintop.  I think for many, it is easy to experience the presence of God when we are on top of the mountain — both literally and figuratively.<br><br>I remember of a time when I was still in high school.  We attended a young people’s conference in a remote barrio of Jimenez.  On the last day, we woke up early to climb up a hill where we were to hold our closing worship. When we were on top of the hill watching the sunrise, I felt God was very near.<br><br>Some pastors of Central Mindanao Conference told me that they decided to go into full time pastoral ministry after attending a youth conference, where there was this pastor whose preaching was so moving that they felt God was calling them.<br><br>I hope also that when we come to worship, it can be an experience when we feel God being present in our midst.  <br><br>As we sing our hymns or listen to the choir sing; when we listen to the Word read and preached; or when we say our prayers; or when we partake of the broken bread and drink from the cup, you, too, can hear God’s voice talking to you.<br><br>Or it can also be those times when you hear some good news, like passing the board exams, or celebrating certain mile posts and accomplishments, or being with a friend can be an experience with God.<br><br>Those are the times when we know that God is not dead.  Those are the times when we can say that God transformed us, and we are never the same again. And like Peter, we would want to stay there forever, never to come down to the valleys.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">      II<br></div><br><br>        But you know, there are times when we, too, can feel God’s presence in the valleys.  It may not be as obvious as when we are on the mountaintop.  But I believe that if we have the eyes to see, just like the brilliant detective in Edgar Allan Poe’s story, we, too, can see God.  <br><br>You may ask, “Where is God in the brutality of war in Egypt, Afghanistan, or in some parts of Mindanao? Where is God in the political corruption everywhere we look, that even the military, whom we look up to for protection, is not exempted from?  Where is God when typhoons, earthquakes, landslides, volcanoes erupt, wiping out hundreds of lives overnight?  Where is God with all of the competing religions, each claiming to hold the truth?  Where is God in the everyday dreariness of life when we feel empty? Where is God in our personal grief that never makes it to the headlines? Where is God when a young person kills herself because she sees no more hope?”<br><br>One time I was in the emergency room waiting for the doctor. As I looked at the others in the waiting area, also feeling miserable, doubts and insecurities started creeping in my mind. I sat there cursing the pain, blaming the doctor for not being there right away, and looking for God who seemed so remote.   <br><br>As I look back to that experience and read this passage, I say to myself that God must be present even in the valleys.  In the story, we are told that Jesus was there healing the sick and sharing the Good News. <br><br>We must look for God’s presence in what appears to be something ordinary, or even in those times when we think that God is so far away.  If we cannot understand how God is present in a world full of violence, maybe we can see God in the people of quiet courage who try to make peace in the midst of war, violence, bombs and abductions for money.  <br><br>If we cannot find God in a world with typhoons, landslides, earthquakes, maybe we can see God in the people who reach out in love to those who have lost everything.  <br><br>If we cannot find God in a world where children die of cancer, maybe we can see God in the courage those children often show.  <br><br>If we cannot find God in a world of competing religions, maybe we can see God in those who choose dialogue to find wisdom in other faith traditions.  <br><br>If we cannot see God because of our own individual pain, maybe we can find God in those who care for us and keep our hopes up.  These experiences help us see God’s grace and power shining through the darkness of the world.<br><br>Thus, as we worship and come around the Lord’s Table, I pray that this can be an experience of transfiguration.  I pray that in our caring for one another, we can reveal God more clearly to a world that is searching for God.  <br><br>Poe’s inspector had nearly given up looking for the stolen letter. Most likely, so many have given up hope of finding God even here on our campus.  <br><br>May this church reveal God to those who cannot see God through the fog of their pain.  For those who have known only a distorted view of God as too judgmental, too punitive; may this church reveal a God who loves us in spite of who we are.  For those who think they have no need of God, who think they can get by without God, may this church reveal God as the Shepherd who looks for the lost.  <br><br>Let us reveal enough of God for people to begin their journey of faith.  Let us go out into the world, and be the agents of their transfiguration because we, too, have been transfigured because of God’s presence in our lives.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

This was going to be one of the activities of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Kapunungan sa mga Mass Communicators</span>, our College council, to mark the 45th year of the SU College of Mass Communication.{{more}} <br><br>Making our way up crumbling stone steps, past mausoleums filled with bright plastic flowers, photographs of their dearly departed, and marble tombs polished to shine, we were disheartened at the sight of the weed-covered gates that led us to the grave of Dr. Henry Mack, builder of radio station DYSR, and therefore, one of the founders of Silliman Universityâ€™s media institution.<br><br>Over the years, creeping tendrils had grown over the ground of the American Cemetery, nearly covering every inch of exposed surface. Because no families of the Americans buried there apparently came to visit regularly, it seemed like it had also become the dumping ground of  most of the tattered plastic flowers, broken glass, huge and brittle orange and blue <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">trapal</span>. <br><br>Stepping past the dirty white gates was akin to walking into a miniature jungle, a clash of wilderness amidst neatly-trimmed bougainvillea hedges and gleaming stone. A group of about 10 tombs lay smothered by foliage within the American Cemetery walls, and tall mahogany trees lined the perimeter, casting a shadow of gloom over the lot.<br><br>Rolling up our sleeves, we set out to work on the daunting task before us: cleaning up the American Cemetery grounds, and restoring dignity to the hallowed remains buried there of the American missionaries who helped Silliman University at various various points since it was founded in 1901. <br><br>Armed with a couple of rakes and a solitary grass clipper, we hacked at weeds, and dragged them away to clear the ground. A good many of us were unequipped with proper tools.  Or who would have thought the â€œyard of tombsâ€ had actually grown into a forest with weeds up to our knees?! I myself had brought with me a laughably tiny trowel which proved utterly useless, and had to help by tearing the unruly greenery out by the fistful.<br><br> I am quite certain we would have broken out in tears of frustration were it not for the (perhaps, divine?) intervention of the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">bunlay</span>-wielding men who arrived for reinforcement. For this we thank Prof. Irma Faith, Pal, our teacher and adviser, Silliman alumnus Benjamin Bokingo and SU Masscom alumni Ruben â€œBobotâ€ Bokingo and Alex Pal for their support and generosity. <br><br>Without their farmhandsâ€™ assistance, and at the rate of our clean-up attempt, the weeds would have likely grown faster than we could clear them; and left to rely on the kind strangers stumbling upon our outstretched hands and muffled cries from under the foliage, weâ€™d have to wait to be dug out by people more proficient at wielding gardening shears than we were.<br><br>Progressing much faster with the help of the workers, we had the American Cemetery neat and clean in no time. <br><br>Taking a breather, I glanced around, and was astonished by the remarkable difference. No longer did the space feel cramped and claustrophobic, but light and airy. The tall trees that seemed so ominous at first, now cast a gentle shade over the area. <br><br>We stood by the enormous mound of weeds and garbage we had collected, sweaty and grimy and with itchy calves, and surveyed our handiwork. We listened to Mr. Ben Bokingo talk about Dr. Henry Mack, the man we had come to pay our respects to, and looked around in awe as he pointed out the trees they had planted in his name about five years ago.<br><br>We left the American Cemetery and the grave of Dr. Henry Mack tired to the bone, but with our spirits light. We had just paid homage to one of the most tireless pioneers of communication in Dumaguete, a man who was an institution in himself, and an indefatigable contributor to the College of Mass Communication, in the best way we know how â€” hard work and dedication, following the example he led.<br><br><a style=\"font-style: italic;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/remembering-henry-mack-builder-of-dysr-i11-286.htm\">For pictures, click here</a><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>Perhaps the first public environmental act of Atty. Antonio A. Aposa Jr. was as a UP Law student when he rounded up the warring fraternity members and made them plant <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">balete</span> trees in the Diliman campus. <br><br>Reading about this inspired me to submit a proposal to the FU Administrative Council that the 62nd commencement ceremonials where Oposa is guest speaker and will be bestowed an honorary degree of Doctor of Humanities, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">honoris causa</span>, will have him planting a tree at the FU main campus. <br><br>This was never done before in any commencement exercises, noted my colleagues.   Seems irrelevant to a solemn ceremony, and seemingly-un-academic in nature.<br><br>I asked: “Is there anything visible on campus to evoke memories of all the past illustrious men (no woman, yet) on whom FU has recognized with an honorary degree?” “What beckons the honorees and their children to come back and visit their Alma Mater after they have received their degrees?” “Has anyone among those whom FU had so honored come back to visit the campus?”<br><br>Maybe if we make them plant a tree, they will be curious enough to come back and see how their tree is growing. So let’s start a tradition, with Atty. Oposa, of planting the first tree on campus to record all subsequent persons who are so honored by Foundation University, I suggested.<br><br>As the proponent, I asked around what tree is most appropriate for Oposa to plant. First suggestion was to replicate what he did at UP, plant a balete tree. No, I said, let’s do something different. How about the stately Philippine mahogany to symbolize his achievements? A fire tree was also suggested, which caught my fancy because I recall a declaration that Oposa made in a eulogy he delivered for his colleague and fellow Magsaysay Awardee, nature and sea defender Elpidio “Jojo” de la Victoria, who was murdered on April 12, 2006 allegedly by protectors of illegal fishing syndicates in Bantayan, Cebu: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“If you think you have extinguished the fire of our fervor, you have only fanned the flame of passion.”</span> <br><br>The reference to “fire” and “flame” made me choose the fire tree, and we began to execute the plan.<br><br>FU landscaper Joseph Culagbang had his boys dig the hole on the ground, appropriately located in front of the College of Law & Jurisprudence. The fire tree seedling was selected, and a protective fence was likewise prepared. I also ordered a sign made by the Creative Department signifying that the tree was planted by Oposa and quoting that portion of the eulogy. Everything was ready, a week prior to commencement day. Or so I thought.<br><br>Monday morning, March 14, six days before commencement day, the Administrative Council met for a final briefing. I was assigned to deliver whatever needs to be said in the tree-planting ceremony. March 15, at around 2 in the morning, I woke up with a start, for like out of a dream, a question popped up in my mind: “Mequi, what do you know about fire trees?” <br><br>Jumping out of bed, I grabbed my iPad and typed in the search box: “characteristics of fire tree” and I was horrified to read: <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Fire tree (Morella faya tree) is designated as a noxious weed. Or a plant species that has been designated by state or national agricultural authorities as one that is injurious to agricultural and/or horticultural crops and/or humans and livestock.” </span><br><br>The thought of making Tony Oposa plant a noxious tree alarmed me.<br><br>With the wonder of the internet, I chose to tell the rest of the story through the following emails, and please note the time these were sent:<br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Perry Mequi to Alex Pal, 2:09:01 –I am desperate, and I need your help. I created the scenario for AO to plant a fire tree to symbolize his passion and fervor as a warrior of nature. I just did research on the fire tree and found that it is one of the 100 worst and most noxious plants for many ecological reasons. Please do something to make Tony reveal what is his favorite tree. Otherwise, we will resort to his planting a mango tree, or just replicate what he did in the UP campus, plant a balete tree. May I have this info asap as we have just a few days before commencement day?</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Alex to Antonio Oposa, 5:48:45 – One activity we have included for your arrival on commencement day is the planting of the Tony Oposa tree inside the FU main campus. We thought of a fire tree but Dr. Mequi now says it is supposedly not a good specie. Do you have a preferred tree?</span><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Oposa to Alex, 6:58:56—Thanks. I like that. Ilang ilang would be good. Or a bamboo. Holds a lot of water.</span><br><br>In less than five hours, we got the go signal to proceed to accomplish what I had wanted to do for a man whom I described to Atty. Rudy Fernandez, a classmate of Oposa, thus: “I never had an idol but at my age of 74, I found one in Atty. Oposa.”<br><br>The ilang ilang or perfume tree that Atty. Antonio Oposa plants at the FU campus this March 20, and which we anticipate will grow tall, emitting its special fragrance over our campus for many years yet to come, finds significance in this line from Michael Roudnitska: “A perfume which lasts is carrying the direction of the future.”<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Maybe this year I can go further afield in subject matter- for example, to other places in the Philippines that I’ve seen, even other parts of the world. But, after all, this is a Dumaguete newspaper; so I will always have a Dumaguete audience in mind, even if I’m not writing about local affairs every week.<BR><BR>This  picture, for example. It was taken on the docks In Cebu. I was there waiting to board a fast craft back to Dumaguete. To people here, it would seem like a very ordinary scene; piles of containers, a truck loading at the docks, a hot day, a worker with his head wrapped in white cloth against the dust and the sun. <BR><BR>Of course I knew this when I took the picture. But I also saw how it would look to people from Europe and America- through Western eyes. From that point of view it’s a very sinister picture, even a frightening one.<BR><BR>The man on the truck is the very image of an faceless terrorist, his head wrapped to hide his identity. He looks out through black eye-slits, with murderous intent, at his potential victims. The containers behind him aren’t innocent either. They contain all the horrors of war: high explosives, nerve gas, anti-personnel mines, machine guns, missiles.<BR><BR>Even the truck seems hostile: ‘Not For Hire’, it says.  Soon, loaded with weapons of mass destruction, it will drive off to its appointed target: a bank, a church, an innocent village. Images of screaming faces, smoke, fire, death, will follow- flashed around the world. Another terrorist outrage. <BR><BR>In New York or Berlin, that’s what they’d see in this picture, with a cold feeling in the pit of the stomach. Of course it’s nonsense; but this kind of image, a hooded figure on a truck, has become an icon of evil in the media- and the emotional response is automatic.<BR><BR>Laughing children, serious soldiers, sweet brides- People see in these universal images what they’re taught to see: “innocence”, “protection”, “happiness”. <BR><BR>But this picture- a hooded man on a truck: It’s not a universal image. What it means depends on where you come from. For people here, it’s just a picture of ordinary life.  For people in the West, it’s an image of the worst thing they can imagine.<BR><BR><IMG \"ALIGN=LEFT\" BORDER=\"0\" SRC=\"https://dumaguetemetropost.com/MinorityReport3-20.jpg\"><BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

The jobs are in the agriculture, services and industry sectors.<BR><BR>But if job-hunting fails, our graduates can look around them for employment.

   "body": "<BR><BR>The recent disaster in Japan beginning March 11, 2011 was a confluence of related events, namely earthquake, tsunami, and overheating of the nuclear reactors which could result in meltdown.<BR><BR>The television reporters explained the cause-and-effect relations among these three events.  However, their explanations were sometimes unclear. I will try to clarify these causal relations in this essay for laypersons, as well as draw lessons from this disaster.<BR><BR>It should be stated at the outset that Japan is a developed country, the third largest economy in the world, where technology use is at its peak. So we wonder why the nuclear plant was built at a site near the coastline in northern Japan, where the probability of the occurrence of tsunamis is high.<BR><BR>It could not be because the site was near the sea so salt water was available for cooling purposes. I understand that salt water is not a good medium to cool nuclear reactors, and the Japanese know this for sure.<BR><BR>The reason is probably the absence of geologic faults at the site. Japanese scientists must have known that their country is located on top of the subduction zone (Japan Trench), which is 9000 meters at its deepest point. They must have known that this subduction zone is the point where the oceanic and denser Pacific Plate “subducts” (goes under) the lighter but thicker Eurasian Plate producing heat.<BR><BR>My son Moses, a geologist, explains that when stress at the subduction zone was released, the earthquake occurred and earth material in the zone buckled up, displacing ocean water, and caused the tsunami.<BR><BR>If earth material had not buckled, no tsunami probably occurred. So, not all earthquakes originating in oceans produce tsunamis.  <BR><BR>The Japanese people also know that their country is visited by earthquakes, being part of the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean, and that tsunamis (which is Japanese in origin) often develop when oceanic lithospheric plates “subduct” the lighter continental plates.<BR><BR>The disastrous Aceh (Sumatra) tsunami in December 2004 occurred in the same way.<BR><BR>The Japanese scientists and technologists had prepared very well in ensuring the safety of their nuclear plant. But they apparently forgot to relate the earthquake and the tsunami to the operation of the nuclear reactor, and they stand to pay dearly for this neglect.<BR><BR>We are very sorry that the disastrous event caused the deaths of several thousands of Japanese people, and the destruction of their communities and infrastructure. We can only pray for the victims at this time. I sent an email to my friends that included Filipinos in the Asia Pacific University in Beppo City in southern Japan, and I am glad to know they were spared by the rampaging waters of the tsunami.<BR><BR>What happened in northern Japan can teach us a valuable lesson: to understand the processes of nature as a guide to our decisions and actions.<BR><BR>Our natural setting is no different from that of Japan; we are also an archipelago in the Ring of Fire. We have at least four areas of active subduction that can result in earthquakes and tsunamis.<BR><BR>One tsunami, which killed some 7,000 people, I think in the early 1990s, occurred in the Cotabato Trench. It can be expected that we will have our own share of natural disasters.<BR><BR>In the Philippines, the majority of us do not have respect for natural laws or even our man-made laws, rules, and regulations. As a simple example, take a look at how Filipinos drive vehicles in cities like Metro Manila, how drivers of buses and jeeps discharge their passengers at the wrong places along highways and streets, and how pedestrians behave recklessly on busy streets and lose their lives for failure to cross at designated pedestrian lanes. And traffic enforcers, paid to enforce traffic rules, are not able to do much about these violations; some of them have  even been reported to ask payment for condoning violations. These behaviors are not observed in countries where people are disciplined such as Japan and South Korea.<BR><BR>As somebody in a recent television program stated, we have a damaged culture, akin to what I call a damaged physical environment.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Now, the effects of radiation from the damaged nuclear plants are of utmost concern to the whole world.<BR><BR>Japan is one of the most modern, developed countries, but the enormity of the devastation cannot be overlooked, hence, it needed the assistance of the member-countries of the United Nations. <BR><BR>The Philippines sent its recovery and rescue teams along with medical doctors with experience in trauma medicine.  This is our moral duty, and to recall, Japan usually is the first to respond and help the Philippines after a calamity. The presence of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) projects in our Province is a testament to the generosity of the Japanese people.  <BR><BR>We cannot imagine how the calamity had impacted on the lives of the thousands of Japanese people, along with the Filipinos who lived in the area of Sendai and its environs.<BR><BR>Let us be reminded that the Philippines is within the Ring of Fire or the earthquake-fault line of the Pacific Rim. Many are now asking: “Are we prepared for a big one?”  But most people cannot answer that question. Let us remind our government officials about that question.<BR><BR>On the brighter side, Japan in its rebuilding efforts will need a lot of workers, mostly in the construction and health sector. The Chinese saying says: “The other side of calamity is opportunity!”  The field of study of nuclear science-radiation will be in focus, and there will be advancement in the treatment of the effects of radiation, fall-out, or melt down. After the Japan Disaster 2011, there will be breakthroughs in the study of earthquakes, tsunamis, and nuclear plants. There will be advanced nuclear technology, the whole world will be wiser for it. <BR><BR>With a brave and unified world, this will present job opportunities to the many who are graduating from our schools, colleges, and universities this March.<BR><BR>But more importantly, the earthquake that lasted only a few minutes on a clear afternoon reminds us how fragile life can be. <BR><BR>They say that some Japanese do not believe in God because they are so focused on practical things, and they are abundant in material things. In fact, they are the most prepared nation for earthquakes.<BR><BR>This is the reason that we have faith, when we look up to a Higher Being whom we know as God, and that we submit our fate in the hands of God. This is why we pray everyday, and we try to cherish each moment of life. This is the reason why we believe and pray that we will be spared from the Big One.<BR><BR>    *****<BR>Congratulations to Francis George Yap who is graduating from the SU College of Nursing!<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Resisted making statements or taking questions -- at least in the league where there are a majority of more senior, learned and experienced mayors than myself.<br><br>But I had to break it in the past few days. As a Mayor and as one of the youth, I have to make our voice heard.<br><br>In the national papers, the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) has been accused of being selfish, greedy, and a bully in objecting to the cityhood of 16 municipalities. <br><br>With all due respect, please allow this eight-months new, and yes, young Mayor to set things straight and clear. This not a bully, and is not even in any position to bully such high-positioned officials as the honorable judges of the Supreme Court. To start with, what do mere mayors or the League have over the SC to bully them with? Probably wrong league or wrong branch of the government. Let’s admit facts and realities here; it’s far and beyond our powers and capabilities.<br><br>As public servants who directly answer and deal with their constituency on a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">daily</span> basis, it is incumbent upon every mayor to search and exhort every means possible to find additional funding for projects and programs to better serve our people. As a Mayor myself, we basically feel the same desire, have the same dream, and work with the same dedication to achieve such dreams. <br><br>With that, it is with full understanding that we recognize the efforts, and feel the desire of the 16 municipalities applying to become cities. And with that, we want to make it clear that the League of Cities is not hoarding, holding back, or saving for themselves allotments for cities; we are not being selfish. We are very <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">willing to share, provided</span> that the criteria as provided for in the Local Government Code are met. <br><br>It is vastly erroneous and wrong to try to pin words as “bully” and “greedy” on a League that merely wants the laws to be upheld. The Local Government Code is the bible of every LGU, and as stated in the constitution, is the source of all mandates and powers. It defines how local governments can work to ensure that lives of every single individual is protected and enhanced. <br><br>Is respect for such law that defines and empowers local governments qualifying enough for one to be labelled a bully and greedy? If changes to certain provisions of the LGC are desired, why can’t the amendment of such be done first? Do things right. That’s what we were elected and appointed to do!<br><br>It is disappointing to realize that institutions, or portions of them, entrusted to craft laws are <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">themselves bullies</span> who twist things, and assign words that do not even fit the essence. It is disappointing that institutions entrusted to interpret laws with finality seem to have a problem understanding the law and the word ‘final’.<br><br>It is especially disappointing for a Mayor as myself, who not only represents her City, but her generation as well to witness this inability to protect and respect the law. This is not a fight against cities or municipalities. This is not an issue about IRA. This is a gnawing concern about the rule of law, and the certainty and the adherence to the law.<br><br>Mayor or not, elected official or not, employed or not, male or female, married or not, young or old -- we all wake up each day with hope that today we can pave for a more sustainable future for ourselves, our families, our children, our city, our municipality, province and country. <br><br>We all hope for the same things, dream the same dream, that we can live and let live. To do so, certain things must be adhered to with utmost respect to capacitate oneself, and to enable others to simultaneously achieve the same dream. Without which, individual ability to reach the dream becomes a literal cut throat race. Understanding such, why can’t we respect the same laws that provide and ensure such?<br><br>Being one of the “hope of the motherland”, to quote our national hero, it is horrifying to realize there may be no assurance of a future. We live in a very uncertain world, with all the mounting challenges. What future will we have if we don’t have the certainty of the law? What hope will we have that we have justice if there is no finality on the relied supreme interpretation of the law? What hope is there if the <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">last</span> recourse is not quite the last after all? This is a gripping fear of a very uncertain and unsecured future. <br><br>As Mayor and as a young hopeful person, it is not my fondest desire to leave a legacy of indecisiveness. It is not my desire to muddle things even more, and leave the next generation to fight off on their own. If there is anything I have learned or understood in my not-so-long 30-year existence, it is that by conscience and fear of the Lord, we must make better what we can during our watch.<br><br>It is with every hope that this young Mayor prays in behalf of every single individual, male or female, young or old, in municipalities and cities that the esteemed and honored individuals entrusted to <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">craft and interpret</span> laws do so with utmost reverence, for every child born in this time, and in the yet to come. Not for any other interest or desire, but for what we are elected and appointed for. I pray.  <br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Karen Villanueva</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Mayor, Bais City</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Alan Peter Cayetano and Gov. Roel Degamo have each pledged to sink P1 million for the construction of a two-storey dormitory building within the NORSU Guihulngan Campus.  <BR><BR>Set up barracks-style, the first floor will be for male students while the second floor will accommodate female students with a common mess hall, laundry area and study rooms. “Sen. Cayetano has emphasized that there should be a study area in the dormitory,” said Villanueva. <BR><BR>The dormitory can only house 100 students in a campus with close to 2,000 scholars. “A committee will be formed to screen the students who are interested to stay in the dormitory. We will be prioritizing those who are from far-flung and hinterland areas,” explained Villanueva, who sits as chairman of the the Committee on Education at the Provincial Board.  <BR><BR>Villanueva is hopeful that the dormitory will address the financial woes of parents who have a hard time ensuring that their children finish their college education. “With the free dormitory, it will lessen the expenses faced by parents in sending their children to college,” said the lady board member. <BR><BR>Guihulngan City Mayor Ernesto Reyes have also pledged to provide sand and gravel for the construction of the dormitory and for a dormitory caretaker which will be paid for by the city government while soldiers of the Philippine Army unit based in Guihulngan will serve as the manpower resources during the construction. <BR><BR>Villanueva is targeting the dormitory completion before the start of school in June. However, as of this writing, construction has not yet started pending the arrival of the promised funds from the office of Sen. Cayetano.

Roel Degamo to turn over to them the P10,000 checks as cash aid to the displaced workers from the provincial government.<BR><BR>It took a while for the busy governor to arrive but the OFWs were already used to waiting, just like how they desperately waited to be rescued out of Libya.<BR><BR>For Deborah Barba, nurse from Dumaguete who sought greener pastures in Libya, it was a long, torturous wait. “We were waiting for a long time to be rescued because the chartered planes took so long to arrive,” she said.<BR><BR>That was the second time Deborah and her fellow Filipino friends endured a long wait. Earlier, back in when they were still in Tripolo, they waited while the Philippine government negotiated lengthily – almost two weeks - for ships that would take the displaced Filipino workers out of the area. “I was so desperate to go home already at that point,” she said.<BR><BR>Despite the uncertainty that rocked the country due to civil unrest, some of Deborah’s OFW friends still chose to stay in Libya. “You see, we were given a choice to go home or not. Many chose to stay because they were afraid that there will be no jobs here for them if they come back to the Philippines,” related Deborah.<BR><BR>Heavy equipment operator Ben Contes said he would still go back to Libya where he has worked for nearly 20 years, if given the chance. “I have grown fond of Libya. If given the chance, I’d still go back there, regardless of my age and also because I have three kids and life is hard here in the Philippines,” said the 59-year old whose family lives in Bacong town.<BR><BR>When the governor finally arrived, a hush fell over the room as Gov. Degamo went around to shake the hand of each OFW, patting them on the back and hugging some of them as he extended his sentiments on their plight. “I am deeply saddened by what happened to our OFWs, because you are our modern heroes due to the remittances you send back to the Philippines,” he said as he faced the group of OFWs.<BR><BR>The governor has decided to give each Libya repatriate the amount of P10,000 – the same amount handed by the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration to the displaced workers upon their arrival at the Manila airport – while promising that this is not the last aid the provincial government will extend to them.<BR><BR>As he sat down with the OFWs in his office, the governor asked them not to return to Libya. “Please don’t force yourselves to go back there. We will try to find ways to give you additional aid, and if possible, some livelihood assistance,” said Degamo.<BR><BR>When the governor started handing over the checks, the OFWs were all smiles. 38-year old Joel Latoy from Sibulan town, who returned to the country penniless after one year and two months of work in Libya, rubbed the check in his hands almost as if he was afraid it would disappear. “I was not paid for two months in Libya because of the chaos there,” he said.<BR><BR>Latoy has two kids studying at ABC Kiddie Center and the cash aid will go a long way in making sure there’s food on his family’s table while he plunges into job-seeking status once again. “I will use this, and the money I received from OWWA, to buy our daily needs for now, for the meantime that I don’t have a job yet. This is a big help to my family,” he said, as he thanked President Noynoy Aquino for the government’s efforts to bring them safely out of conflict-ridden Libya and the financial help.<BR><BR>With their cash aids from the provincial government and the OWWA, the OFWs say they now face chance to start over and beging a new chapter in their lives.<BR>The single nurse Barba plans to open a small business in the city, while Latoy will use the money to feed his family as he goes around looking for a job. “I want to work here for now, but once I have saved up enough I’d like to work abroad again,” he said.

   "body": "<html><br><br>    <head><br><br>    </head><br><br>    <body><br><br>        <br><br>In this University Town where people come and go like the swiftly changing tides from Tañon Strait, goodbyes are constant we’ve learned to live with hearts perpetually broken.<br><br>Dumaguete is a City of beautiful transients. There are all these wonderful people from far-flung places with airy names—Dipolog, Iligan, Cagayan de Oro, Marawi, Cebu, Tacloban, Davao, Dap-dap, Malaybalay, Coron, Quezon City, Los Angeles, New York, Madrid. People come, most of them to study; people gradually find themselves falling in love with the acacia trees and the sunrise off the Boulevard; people stay, for years even; and then, because the City is a cocoon, people go. <br><br>Growing up here, that endless cycle of farewells used to bother me acutely, and there came a time when—exhausted from having to say goodbye year in and year out—I simply closed shop, padlocked my heart, and regarded each new wave of people with cautious reach, if I could be bothered at all. But life does not work like that. One meets wonderful people still, and it is a kind of crime not to become part of their lives, and them in yours. <br><br>One such is the essence of bubbliness herself. Her name is May Justine Gata-Colburn, and for a better part of the past few years, she was one of “my girls”—that select group of women, all of them fabulous, who have custody of my heart. There is a reason for that.<br><br>What I know of her story is this: Once upon a time, many years ago, she came from wintry Milwaukee on the way to Siquijor for some break. She passed by Dumaguete, of course, and took what must have been a very long pause—because she went back to the United States, quit her job, packed all her belongings, and took her husband Jonathan and her two children to live here. Why? I asked her once. “It felt like the right thing to do,” she said with that familiar, infectious laugh—a tinkling that borders on some form of flightiness.<br><br>They bought a Mister Donut franchise and brought it to Dumaguete. The first time I met her, it was for an article I had to write for <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">MetroPost</span>. We met in what was then a Mister Donut outpost in what used to be Sted’s fronting Silliman University’s Katipunan Hall. It was for an interview. She fed me sandwiches, and we were both playing out our professional roles: she as savvy entrepreneur, me as food writer. <br><br>That we began like that seems so funny now, a few years and a thousand round of wine-flavored laughter later. God knows how long ago that was—but I’d seen her even before that first encounter. We were both regulars at Chantilly’s then. I would occupy one table to do my academic drudgery, and she would occupy another table interviewing an endless string of people. I remember asking myself, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">What is that woman doing?</span> Later on, I would learn she was interviewing people for staff positions in her donut kingdom.<br><br>I don’t recall exactly how we became fast friends. Great friendships are like that. The origins are always hazy. You only know the intricate chemistry involved—but I bet that around that time, we had shed off those initial roles we played for each other, and began discovering that we were both capable of the craziest things. <br><br>If I try to recall in concentrated form my best memories of Justine, they will almost always involve food. Because we loved to eat—Jonathan is one of the best gourmets this City has seen—and we loved to have elaborately-prepared dinners together, always in the company of Arlene Delloso-Uypitching, Wing del Prado, Moses Joshua Atega, Patrick Chua, Antonio Quiogue, and Jeremy Schmoll (sometimes with Edo and Annabelle Lee-Adriano, and when they are in Dumaguete, the visual artists Paul Pfeiffer and Razceljan Salvarita). <br><br>There are also these: her discovery of a royal bloodline to the Kiram sultanate of Sulu, her devotion to People magazine, our beer-stained gossip sessions in Boston Café and Gabby’s Bistro, lazy stargazing in Mampas, and back massages. May Justine Gata-Colburn gives the best back massages this side of the universe. <br><br>And finally this: she has one of the biggest hearts I know, it fills a room. <br><br>For Arlene, her best memory to top all best memories would be that time she asked Justine to find a missing passport.  She was already in Manila, the passport was in Dumaguete, and the discovery took place only a few hours before her international flight. “We were relaxing in our hotel in Manila,” she said, “when Don casually went through our travel documents, and noticed my mother-in-law’s passport was missing among the lot. I could only think of one person who would not think twice about zooming to our house and combing our files to look for it. And zoom she did. I called Justine who was in the middle of a massage. She immediately got up, pulled over a <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">malong</span>, and with nothing under, flew to the house, grabbed all the passports she could find, zoomed to the airport, and fought with the cargo personnel who refused to take the package since the receiving counter was already closed for the last flight of the day to Manila.  Still, Justine had her way. The passport was not among those she sent, but the whole experience sealed my utmost trust and confidence in her. She’s more than family to me.”<br><br>The rest of us will remember most her laughter. “I chuckle when I think of Justine,” says Razceljan Salvarita, and lawyer Myrish Cadapan-Antonio says: “What I remember most of her is her infectious laugh and very amiable personality. In any conversation, Justine does not fail to make me smile. She is such a kindred spirit and will surely be missed!” <br><br>Antulang Beach Resort’s Annabelle Lee-Adriano remembers this: “At the height of her birthday party, which she had at Antulang, she started talking to me about leaving her two dogs behind—and how that’s going to be one of the hardest things about leaving Dumaguete. Birthday girl is about to cry, and me with her.”<br><br>Restaurateur Gabby del Prado says: “Tita Justine is one cool <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">tita</span>! She’s like your best buddy, and there never is a dull moment when you’re around her. One time, she and Tita Arlene were spying on a famous actor who was staying in Florentina Homes. I helped them all the way for them to meet their idol!  There were a lot of fun times we’ve had together at the Bistro with her family as well, and I’m surely going to miss the bonding we’ve had.” <br><br>His mom, Wing, on the other hand, says: “I will remember most her bling-bling sandals and her girlie bags! She’s our chatterbox <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">saling-pusa</span> when Arlene and I are painting walls over at the Bistro!”<br><br>KRI’s Ritchie Armogenia says: “Justine has always been one of our favorite customers. The Colburns are. They usually let us know when they come in, and we really appreciate that. One favorite memory would have to be that time they went to KRI and started ordering a few items on the menu, and then they ended up ordering almost everything—a chef’s delight!”<br><br>We all have these memories because Justine and her family are leaving Dumaguete and going back to the U.S. Why? I asked her not too long ago. “It’s time,” she said—this time a little sad.<br><br>We are all a little sad, too. And it’s true what I said once before: What’s my favorite thing about Mr. Donut? It’s the Mrs.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Along comes an outsider—an interloper, essentially—whose personality and passion ignite changes in the status quo, leading to tragedy or a shakedown of perfectly preserved pretense. But of course love endures.<br><br>Guadagnino’s hypnotic film, however, shows how cinematic art can be made: through a thorough knowledge of the vocabulary of cinema, the elements keenly manipulated to advance—in visual and narrative terms—this story of a Russian woman married to the patriarch of a rich Milanese family, who finds passion and a dream of escape from the stifling contours of her rigidly ordered life in a young chef, the best friend of her son. We somehow know this film will end in tragedy, but even given that, Guadagnino keeps us guessing with every passing scene, so much so that when the tragic finally strikes, it comes out of nowhere, striking us dumb with its brutality and suddenness. This is a beautifully made film, gorgeously shot, and captures the Italian landscape in a washed out but also paradoxically deeply colorful terrible beauty. It is so nuanced and so sure of its every cinematic intentions, and so loving of its influences that include Michaelangelo Antonioni and Alfred Hitchcock and Sally Potter. The key to its success, aside from Tilda Swinton’s unbelievable performance as Emma, is the way Guadagnino handles his camera: he uses it as a caress, as a stalking presence, as a detached observer of high society life, as a microscope lens, as a swooping roller coaster that underlines what is not said—desire, fear, anger, sadness, joy, pain. It is all about the visual choices that make something a masterpiece of an artist who knows what he is going for: in the delicate but also sudden seduction scene between Antonio and Emma in the mountains, for example, we observe Emma taking in the view with a measure of nonchalance dipped in excitement—and then suddenly, we hear a soft crackling sound from behind her, the camera goes out of focus, and in that blurry vision that approximates desire and giving in, we see their obscure figures kissing hungrily. That cinematographic choice felt right, and underlined some more the consummate artistry that this film is made of. Every detail is not wasted and means something—the ukha soup, the seating plan for every meticulously prepared dinner, the ritual of taking off clothes and jewelry, the daughter’s lesbianism, the pool made of sharply angled marble, the housekeeper’s emotional connection with the family, the book that must remain hidden, the names that can’t be recalled, the fact that she has been named Emma by her husband who tells her, “You don’t exist”—all these disparate things mean something, and contribute to such throbbing organic whole. In the middle of all these is the incandescent performance of Tilda Swinton, a Scottish actress playing a trapped Russian woman living in Milan and speaks perfect Italian with a Russian accent. That technicality alone, equal to the chameleon-like power of Meryl Streep, amazes me. That Ms. Swinton is able to marshall all of that to a subtle and also devastating performance is a thing of beauty. Every muscle in her, as she does her craft, shouts sheer believability. This is such a sensual film, a work of art in every way. Set side-by-side with the merely passable, mediocrity suddenly seems almost criminal.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">  ***<br></div><br><br>        Here is an uproarious and original comedy that stars one of Hollywood’s genuine funnymen (Jim Carrey) and one of cinema’s genuine chameleons (Ewan McGregor). Here is a movie that expands the notion of fact being so much weirder and more fantastic than fiction. Here is a movie that a lot of critics loved. But whatever happened to Glenn Ficarra and John Requa’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">I Love You Philip Morris</span> [2010]? It’s Oscar-bait material, but in this season of awards and top-ten lists, it’s not being mentioned as a contender. Mr. Carrey is glorious here, and Mr. McGregor is something else. Already though, the film has had a checkered history: it meandered its way to theaters for months and months, but finally did not find an audience, given the haphazard way it has been handled by its distributors. (Nobody wanted to pick it up.) You have to ask: what went wrong? The marketing? The belated distribution? Or perhaps even homophobia? Perhaps. This is after all the story of the real-life Steve Russell, a gay man and a relentlessly inventive con man whose run-ins with the law have become quite legendary—all of them a result of pursuing the love of his life, Philip Morris, a sweet-natured and blonde Southern boy he meets in prison, while serving a jail sentence for fraud. In a life rife with lies and shape-shifting (manifested as metaphor through moving clouds, a recurring motif in the film), Russell—an ex-cop and former Bible-swearing family man—has impersonated lawyers and CFOs and doctors and what-have-you’s, and has even faked his own death by AIDS. Underneath all that is a fool for love, the only truth he has come to admit, near the end of the film. This is an extraordinary film of an extraordinary life. It is also relentlessly funny and both Carrey and McGregor deserve accolades for their chemistry and for making us believe that all these lies are the makings of magic. Too bad it is not receiving the kind of attention it deserves.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Despite fund shortage, Mayor Chiquiting is merely obsessed with fulfilling his dream for Dumaguete.  He ventured to the Senate to meet some lawmakers whom he believes would share his dreams to come true. <BR><BR>True enough, Sen. TG Guingona Jr., Sen. Bong Revilla, and Sen. Juan Miguel Zubiri each gave P1 million to the provincial office of the Department of Public Works & Highways to make the construction of the boardwalk possible. <BR><BR>Furthermore, the City’s coffers is now P3 million richer, again coming from Senator Guingona, Sen. Ralph Recto, and Sen. Kiko Pangilinan. <BR><BR>Soon, our boulevard would be more beautiful than ever before, and will continue to attract tourists to help our tourism industry, and which will eventually provide more opportunities to create jobs for our young professionals, skilled workers, and our less fortunate. <BR><BR>Had it not been for Sagarbarria the Mayor, how would Dumaguete be, you think?<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>In the spirit of women’s celebration this month of their achievements throughout history,  I think it is an appropriate time for me to talk about the notion of white supremacy here in the Philippines.  White supremacy is a general belief in the superiority of Europeans over other peoples of the world, and one of the symptoms of it is that we Filipinos equate lighter skin and more European facial features with beauty.  <BR><BR>This adulation of whiteness was instilled in us under the Spanish colonial system.  Lucky are those who possess a natural fair-skinned complexion, compared to those who were born dark skinned, because they get many social advantages.  Personally, I consider this a primitive way of thinking.  But the good news is that it’s simply a perception.  In other words, it only exists in our minds. <BR><BR>Let’s put things into perspective.  Yes, we still carry some negative patterns of behavior that we inherited from back when we were under colonial rule, and I understand that a lot of these patterns, specifically this notion of white supremacy, are terribly difficult to overcome.  But we need to try to overcome this one, because it is inhumane and unchristian, and I don’t really think that we want to be that kind of a people.  <BR><BR>One of the ways to stop this collective misguided perception is to start teaching our kids not to judge people according to the color of their skin.  We may not be able to change our own perception that fair skin is better than dark skin, but the trick is not to spill out this misguided perception verbally.  <BR><BR>All of us often have negative thoughts in our minds, but we usually don’t act on them, for obvious reasons, either because they’re inappropriate, ill-mannered or even illegal.  As a professional clinician, I am very sympathetic to all our tendencies including those that are socially unacceptable, for they are simply part of being human.  Some of our tendencies are learned, and others are innate.  However, as we gain wisdom about life in general, we learn to contain and manage these negative tendencies. We are after all, civilized human beings, and to be civilized, we have to adhere to certain protocols of socially acceptable behavior.<BR><BR>I am inclined to believe that this particular misguided perception is a learned behavior, and is a result of many generations of mental conditioning.  This is why this belief is so deep seated, but it also means that it is possible to change it.  If, in the wiser part of ourselves, we accept the idea that this white supremacist mentality is something that should be changed, we can exercise self-control and avoid expressing it to others, especially our children, instead of giving it free reign because “that’s just the way it is here in the Philippines.” <BR> <BR>Yes, that is the way it is here, but it doesn’t have to go on being that way forever.  We protect our children from many things, and from many ideas.  We should protect them from this one too.  That way, perhaps, one day in the distant future, we will change our society for the better by eliminating this white supremacist mentality and celebrating the colorful diversity of our people.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Adopt Dr. Miciano Road – to transform the residences and business establishments along the Dr. Miciano Road adjacent to the University, into a model community by partnering with the City Task Force Action Group Advocating Rapid Reform (SAGARR) in ensuring the observance of ordinances covering such concerns as (a) boarding and lodging facilities, (b) stray dogs, (c) food sanitation, (d) ISWM, (e) curfew and truancy, (f) vagrancy, (g) smoking, (h), traffic control, (i) cyberspace, (j) billiards and pools, and other related matters.<BR><BR>2. Balik Banica - residents of Purok Santan have reverted back to their old ways of throwing their trash in the vicinity of the River and there is a need to go back to care for the part of the Banica River that the University adopted in 2006. Other schools will also be encouraged to adopt portions of the river.<BR><BR>3. Rice is Life - to sustain the twin mission of the program: (a) promote rice conservation, and (b) to inculcate the spirit of sharing and caring for others in the “share a cup of rice” campaign.<BR><BR>4. Adopt the Rizal Boulevard – to campaign for the issuance of Ordinances that will (a) ban motor vehicles from entering the Blvd on Sundays and holidays from 5;00am-10am so that the area can be utilized for wellness and physical activity as well as tourism-related activities; (b) ban firecrackers and fireworks in the vicinity of the bayfront; and (c) ban billboards in the area because there is a close relationship between tourism and the banning of billboards.<BR><BR>5. “Return the Streets and Roads to the People” - (a) to campaign for the passage of a City Ordinance to ban or minimize/control entry of motor vehicles in the downtown area such Perdices and Real streets; (b) enactment of a Provincial Ordinance providing for walking/pedestrian lanes and bicycle paths within a radius of 10k from Dumaguete to make walking and biking possible to and from the municipalities and barangays in Sibulan (5.5km), Valencia (7.5km), and Bacong (8km). Such ordinances will promote a walking culture in our locality to counteract the health-risks and environmental hazards of being the “motorcycle capital” of the Philippines.<BR><BR>6. Convince Businessman Julio Sy, Jr. to fast track the construction of Dumaguete Business Park, Inc. planned Baywalk that will connect the DBPI to the Rizal Blvd, by suggesting that if the Baywalk will integrate the concept of the Road Revolution (30% pedestrian lane, 30%b bike lane, 30% motor vehicle, and 10% for edible gardening), this could be considered a tax shield, a legal provision in the Local Government Code (RA 6160) which authorizes LGUs to provide tax incentives. The Student Government officers will attempt to convince Mr. Sy that FU CWTS, and those of other schools will adopt the 10% edible garden project of the plan.<BR><BR>7. QUARTER MARATHON WELLNESS WALK - to sustain and support the objective of this program which is to encourage the inclusion in the physical education program of schools and academic institutions in UniTown of a quarter-marathon walk to counteract the growing incidence of obesity among students in school and the fact that more than one-third (34.45%) of Filipinos today are overweight. Obesity is the precursor to lifestyle diseases such as cancer, diabeters, repiratory and heart diseases.<BR><BR>FU political science instructor, Kriss Tubog, adviser of the student government, is mobilizing the participation not only of the FU student government but those of other schools and institutions in undertaking those projects which could best be addressed by concerned local goverment officials if more young people are involved. <br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

It was starting to look  dirty and disheveled, so this boy on the grounds crew was assigned to give it a nice new coat of paint  for public viewing.<BR><BR>There are thousands of statues of  Jose Rizal in the Philippines, which is only fitting for the man considered the Founder of his Country.  These statues appear in public parks, town centers, in front of government buildings and shopping malls.  They are almost always standing figures. Rizal is usually shown standing expressionless, arms at his sides, a serious solemn martyr. <BR><BR>It’s true that he died a martyr, due to the paranoia of the authorities. Although as a writer he was harshly critical of those in power, he was neither a warrior nor a revolutionary. He posed no real threat to the government- and he was also popular public figure.  <BR><BR>Considering this, any reasonable administration would have listened to his accusations, and then appointed him to head an investigating committee and prepare a lengthy report. This process could have kept him quiet and forgotten for several years, if not indefinitely.  <BR><BR>Instead, due to the incredible stupidity of the Spanish Colonial administrators,  he was condemned as a traitor and shot dead at Lunetta park in 1896, thus making him a martyr and assuring their own doom. It was a tragic and bizarre fate for a man who was primarily a doctor, a writer and a scholar. This identity of Rizal as a scholar was in the mind of Vicente Sinco when, as President and founder of Foundation University, he commissioned a statue to be made of him. <BR><BR>Dr. Sinco, a writer and a scholar himself, insisted that, on  a university campus, Rizal should be shown seated, quietly reading a book.  The statue was  completed as Dr. Sinco asked-  and now it remains here as one of the few, if not the only statues of Rizal to show him as he probably saw himself.<BR><BR>And so, here in this picture, Dr. Rizal sits reading, with a fresh coat of paint.

We have just cast off from the Dumaguete port on the AM Ocean Jet service to Cebu.  Actually, “cast off” is far too generous a term for what happened.  You see, there was no bollard present at the corner of the wharf where the vessel had been “secured”.  It was missing!  Gone!

Any unforeseen tide, current, wave or gust of wind could have separated us from the port at any time.  I would not have believed it had my own eyes not have witnessed it!<br><br>How long has this state of affairs persisted?  More importantly, how long will you permit it to continue to exist?  Is it not the responsibility of the Port of Dumaguete to maintain the fixed facilities of the port in a good and safe state of repair?  Would prudence not dictate that it offer a safe and complete berth to any regularly scheduled passenger carrier  using the port?  Indeed, should this not be the case with all vessels secured at the Port?<br><br>And what of the carrier, Ocean Jet?  Should not its paramount concern be for the safety of its fare paying passengers?  Would prudence not dictate that the carrier refuse to accept an unsafe berth?<br><br>This activity takes place in the public eye. Many of the travelers are passengers from abroad.  The Philippines has an excellent international reputation for its sailors and their seamanship.  Is it right for this reputation to be diminished by the unacceptable and unsafe condition of its port facilities?<br><br>I repeated this trip in reverse from Cebu to Dumaguete on 14 March 2011.  To my astonishment, this situation had still not been addressed.  This time I had my camera with me.

One reason why there are too many patients in our government hospital, aside from the fact that we also accept patients from southern Cebu, Siquijor and even in communities in Zamboanga del Norte, is that we also lack doctors in the rural areas.<BR><BR>Aside from decongesting the Provincial Hospital, the patients can also save money by not having to come to Dumaguete for treatment.<BR><BR>The Province of Negros Oriental, back in the early ‘90s, won the Galing Pook Award for setting up primary hospitals in the mountains. This was a first, not only in Negros Oriental but also in the entire country and this has now been replicated by other provinces.<BR><BR>The Mobile Doctors Program is another innovation that will set a a trend in the entire country. Perhaps, this could be our entry for the next Galing Pook award!<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "body": "<BR><BR>A very important issue in programs dealing with the conservation of Philippine marine resources is the question of how fast degraded marine biodiversity can recover. A related question is how this recovery can be speeded up. Our research program at Silliman University on coral reefs and fish beginning in the 1970s throws some light on these questions. Answers to these questions, however limited, are useful in development programs that are now being pursued by government such as the present Integrated Coastal Resources Management Project of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.  <BR><BR>First of all, our coral reef survey in the decade of the 1970s with the University of the Philippines already indicated that in general coral reefs tended to recover very slowly. In the 1980s, studies on specific species of hard corals showed very slow growth rates as measured by how much area of the sea bottom is covered within a period of one year. We found that branching corals tended to grow faster than massive species at a rate of 5-10% and massive corals at hardly 1% per year.  These results seem to be comparable with those reported from other areas of the tropical world. <BR><BR>The conditions supporting these rates of growth are good marine water quality, that is, low nutrients and absence of solid particles in water such as silt. In coastal areas with high concentrations of nutrients from land sources and freshwater input, practically all of the branching species have disappeared, leaving mostly massive species. <BR><BR>Overall, in large areas of coral reefs, the annual growth (or increase in live coral cover) was practically zero in marine waters off western Mindanao. The major factor implicated in these very slow rates was the combination of siltation and sedimentation. It could be that there were minute increases not detected by the methods used in the survey.<BR><BR>In contrast, our study of a Cebu reef that was devastated by a typhoon in the early 1980s showed good growth of about 5-10% of mostly branching corals in one year. This reef had good-quality water free of sediments flowing through Tañon Strait.    <BR><BR>In terms of the recovery of fish in reefs, our long term data (10-20 years) published in several scientific papers show that in fully protected areas (MPAs), biomass of target (food) species of fish can increase annually by about 10%, provided water quality is good (no pollutants) and reef areas are fully protected from fishing. These are the two conditions that must be present in protected areas. Our conclusion in these studies is that fish recovery in terms of species richness, abundance and biomass can be expected in the long term provided MPAs are fully protected and water quality remains good.<BR><BR>For integrated coastal management to be successful, MPAs must be protected and managed by local communities (POs, NGOs, LGUs) through a system of co-management that is agreed upon by these primary stakeholders. Government agencies such as Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Department of Environment, academic institutions etc. should act in a supportive role.<BR><BR>The co-management agreement must be implemented strictly without exception. For this to happen in this country, an overseeing body consisting of people with high integrity and unquestioned commitment to conservation should be created to see to it that MPAs are managed and protected according the rules. Only then can programs like the ICRMP succeed in attaining the goal of conservation and improved incomes of coastal communities.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

Being my first year as full-time faculty, and the first time I felt close to a batch, I finally attended the fete the other night. Nothing fancy and more low-key than I expected such a party to be; plenty of good-natured ribbing and very loud cheering. Good clean fun, and I suppose, after four years of toil and tears, a fine way to cap off their last days of student life.<br><br>For all the joy of that evening, I couldn’t dispel the wisp of sadness. Graduation was a couple of days away, but one of the students I knew well wouldn’t be able to march. He already had all the requirements lined up but for one snag--he failed one of his minor subjects. Would that he had been really and truly delinquent in his classes, but no, he missed the mark by just that much.<br><br>Ateneo de Davao follows a number grade system, not letter grades. 100 is the highest grade you can get, 60 the lowest, and the passing cutoff at 75. In our division, we never give a final grade of 74. “It’s a malicious grade,” a co-teacher told me. Any person of common sense and compassion should be able to see why.<br><br>If you were the teacher of a minor subject, say Philosophy, and you had a graduating student who had been attending your classes fairly regularly but did badly in your exams and ultimately failed to make the cut, would you: a) stick with your numbers, or b) fudge the figures to give a passing grade? Or how about a third option: additional for-credit work?<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">         * * *<br></div><br><br>        When I started teaching again two years ago, I resolved that, if I could help it, I wouldn’t flunk any students. It’s not that I wanted to take it easy, or that I wanted to popular, or I felt any large sense of misplaced compassion. Instead, I wanted my students to have a safety net of sorts and use the time they had to explore within the wide boundaries of the subjects I was teaching. Even if I didn’t tell them about my own resolution, I hoped it would be implicit enough. It helped that the courses I taught had extensive practical components and no dependent subjects down the line.<br><br>Looking back at my own days as a student, I think I would have learned more if I enjoyed what I was studying and had more freedom to follow what I wanted. So as a teacher, I wanted to remove the fear of failure; quite the opposite, I wanted to encourage experimentation. I would be the coach, guide, and troubleshooter.<br><br>To a large degree, I think I’ve been successful (as I’ve already written here before). The motivated students have gone further than I expected them to go. As for my unmotivated students? If the carrot failed, I don’t think a stick would have been much more help.<br><br>Up until this semester, I have only had to break that resolution because some students, perhaps working through issues of their own, just stopped coming to class. Those cases can’t be helped. But next semester, I’m going to adjust my policy to be more stringent and less forgiving, at least as far as the lower years are concerned. <br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\"> * * *<br></div><br><br>        This week has been a bloodbath for many of our third year students.<br><br>The second semester of the junior year is the most difficult for the students of our division. Apart from their other subjects, they have two major commitments: their thesis proposal and their systems project. Both undertakings have to undergo panel defense, and they come within a week of each other. It’s not that they’re impossible -- all the students in one section passed with flying colors and another two sections managed to eke by -- but they require time management and dedication.<br><br>But in one section, only two groups--that’s six students in a class of 28--made the grade for their systems project. Sad, yes, but I can’t say that that outcome was entirely unexpected. Really, when these students don’t show up for consultations with their teacher or their adviser throughout the sem, how else should it have ended?<br><br>Last term, though, the fate was already apparent. I taught this section in their Operating Systems class, and by far this was the worst. Poor academic performance I might have managed, perhaps by adjusting goals, or even excused altogether. No, this section just rubbed me the wrong way in every way possible: slouching and sprawling in their chairs during my lectures, unprepared for their presentations, muddling through Facebook during the labs. Every little gesture, every little look was meant to say: I’m not interested in this course, I’d rather be elsewhere.<br><br>Only a handful of students acted this way, but I’m afraid it colored my perception of the section as a whole. The rest followed as best as they could, but in the face of such accidie from their peers, I thought I could sense listlessness and resignation: if my classmates aren’t even going to try, why should I?<br><br>Yet even with what I saw, I opted to err on the side of compassion and understanding. Everyone passed (except for one who dropped the class because he wanted to prove a point to his parents.)<br><br>In hindsight, the excess of kindness may have been a mistake. I view this more in principle than from any specific case. In letting the undeserving through, I have transferred the burden to the next teacher of the next subject. That teacher might even be me!<br><br>Neither, I think, is it fair to their classmates or to the students themselves. Evaluating these past few semesters, the students whom I should have failed exhibited foremost a lack of interest in the program. As such, their continued presence constitutes a distraction to their classmates. Perhaps they really do want to be booted out because they were put into that course against their will.<br><br>Still, it’s hard for me to put down that failing mark. I don’t know why. Maybe I’m thinking about the parents of these students. So much investment, financially and morally...what a waste, really.<br><br>But sooner or later, the weeks and months of neglect eventually catch up with truants. Even if they squeak by me, the next class or project will be sure to catch them. It may be easy to fool a teacher like me, but the chances are less with a combined panel. However, a crash with the panel is only so much more spectacular and bloody.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">   * * *<br></div><br><br>        If there are teachers like me, lenient to a fault, there are also teachers on the opposite extreme.<br><br>Another student, already two years delayed from graduation, on the verge of that march for the diploma, fell on the iffy edge of a 75 for his final grade in a minor subject. He should have done much better, certainly, and that would have eliminated all doubt. After recomputation, it turns out that the teacher made an error and he should have passed after all.<br><br>The story should have had a happy ending, but the teacher wasn’t quite satisfied. Three days to graduation day, the teacher gave a final exam. One day before the graduation on Saturday, he still had not released the grades as he ought to have.<br><br>When teachers from our division asked him if he could turn in the grades, he said no. “I’m not checking the papers until Wednesday next week.” Nothing could convince him to change his mind.<br><br>My co-teachers made one last attempt. “He’s at the library,” someone said. Two of our most affable fellows headed over to make one last effort. As they neared, they heard him shouting from one floor down. <br><br>“No! N! O! I will NOT submit his grades before Wednesday!” He was screaming at a middle-aged couple. The student’s parents had themselves come to plead their son’s case. Shocked at his vehemence, they could say nothing. My friends decided not to put in an appearance and retreated quietly.<br><br>For his parting shot, the teacher said: “Oh, he’ll pass. But he won’t march this Saturday. That’s in exchange for his passing grade.”<br><br>It makes me pause to think what the parents must have thought of this...person.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">     * * *<br></div><br><br>        In a week marred by a devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and civil war in Libya, incidents like these seem inconsequential by comparison. You fail a subject, you take it again or you switch schools. You don’t march in your toga this year, there’s the next year. The damage isn’t permanent (not unless you count the record on a report card) and you can -- you should! -- bounce back. But that’s a view from someone not at the receiving end of failing mark, and probably small consolation from the person more deeply involved. <br><br>I don’t know if I’ll be able to stolid enough to hold fast to my resolution; all I can do is, I suppose, is try.  But it seems to me that, caught between compassion and strict standards, I would much rather take the err on the side of the former.  Lord knows there’s too much misery in the world already.  I’d rather be the cause of joy than sadness.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

Malaysia and Norway are facilitating prickly parleys with Moro and communist insurgents.<br><br> “Progress (was) unlikely during the (Arroyo) administration,” asserts the study published by the Small Arms Survey and South-South Network in Geneva.  ”Better prospects for peace rest on the capacity of successor administration(s) to engage rebel groups. (Otherwise,) another long decade of not always constructive engagement appears inevitable.”<br><br>Over 4,745 were killed and 1,534 injured in armed clashes across four troubled decades, admittedly incomplete tallies claim.  Most were civilians. Over 1.2 million became refugees.  “Rule of the gun stood in the way of ongoing democratization process, begun with such optimism, at the end of the Marcos dictatorship.” <br><br>Leakages from government arsenals, porous borders, and lax rules make “civilian small arms holdings in the Philippines rank among the 30 largest in the world.” <br><br>In 24 chapters, the study documents realities of many Filipinos staring  into gun barrels of  both  rebels and state. It analyzes both the “ideologically driven and militarily strong to the opportunistic and criminal.”<br><br>Specialists profile <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">lumad</span> armed groups, Jemaah Islamiyah, to civilian armed force geographic units  (Cafgus). They analyze gun buy-backs and children drafted or cajoled for “protracted war.” Included are case studies of private armies in Abra and “ Indonesian and Malaysian jihadi groups.”<br><br>The study focuses on Communist and Moro insurgencies. “The CCP-NPA is the longest-running Maoist insurgency in the world.”  Today’s Moro conflicts are rooted in Spanish- Moro wars in the 16th to the 19th century  -- plus 21st century penury.  Muslims today cluster in the 10 poorest provinces.<br><br>“Expectations are high that conflict will be brought to a close” in this fifth decade of treadmill clashes, write co-authors Diana Rodriguez and Soliman M.

Here are excerpts: <br><br style=\"font-style: italic;\"><span style=\"font-style: italic;\">“Military victory eluded security forces (and rebels) and is unlikely in the future”. Communists  are bogged down  in  strategic defense of it’s ‘protracted people’s war’. They’ve never achieved a “great leap forward” of mass adherents. </span><br><br>“Revolutionary taxation” is occasionally reinforced by attacks on mining, logging and other civilian businesses. This dented support for the NPA..“More damming” is killings of peasant leaders and followers in Masbate and Bondoc peninsula.<br><br>Cordillera’s   People’s Liberation Army and others hired out as ‘private armies’ to  local business and political leaders.  Attacks by so-called rouge units against civilians  raised questions about  Moro Islamic Liberation  Front control over its field commanders. <br><br>Early March, the Associated Press reported Commander Ameril Umbra Kato, who earlier massacred  civilians, threatens to break away from MILF. Militiamen fleeing arrest for involvement in the Maguindanao massacre are with Kato.  So far, they’ve not sabotaged the peace talks.<br><br>“MILF and MNLF forces are “limited to the containable Muslim areas of  central and southwestern Mindanao”.  The demographic balance continues to tilt.  “Mindanao is now only about 20 percent Muslim in terms of population…This is almost the exact reversal of Mindanao’s demography a century ago. <br><br>There are successes like the MILF’s ceasefire, for criminal interdiction.  An Ad Hoc Joint Action Group rescued kidnapped hostages and averted  clashes. The group’s “mandate has expired; (but) the agreement continues to function de facto.<br><br>Demise of the Soviet Union and China’s “it-is-glorious-to-get-rich” reorientation have seen international support for rebels wane.  Internal pogroms and policy fractures sapped strength and triggered clashes with  other communist factions. “Armed wings (Huks and Revolutionary Party) had encounters with the NPA. (These) make the fragmentation on the Communist  front worse than on the Moro front.”<br><br>Past policies on peace were incoherent. These were often shaped by pacification, counter-insurgency and lately, counter-terrorism”, instead of resolving conflict. Peace negotiations were undermined.” <br><br>Like traditional politicians, resource-strapped rebels “trade on the promise of better living standards and other benefits. All need public support and far-sighted leaders.  Over 7,000 MNLF members were reintegrated into the Armed Forces.  But MNLF failed to recreate itself as Nur Misuari and associates replicated self–serving practices of traditional politicians. <br><br>Retaining relevance after peace is more difficult than waging revolution.

   "body": "<BR><BR>Most people today are aware that advanced technology drives the world forward. Information and communication technology (ICT) is the most widely used forms of advanced technology, and usually its benefits and convenience are taken for granted. <BR><BR>In the 21st century, the Information Age has given birth to the “knowledge economy.” Information and knowledge produces economic benefits. In one meaning of the knowledge economy, knowledge is a product; while in another, knowledge is a tool. As a product, knowledge (such as the services offered by call centers) has a price and is ‘consumed.’ As a tool, the initial costs of knowledge is absorbed in the higher value of the products and services that result from the use of such knowledge — for example in research and development, such as in the making of software or in pharmaceuticals.<BR><BR>Information and knowledge is not the same thing. According to management guru Tom Davenport, knowledge is information combined with experience, context, interpretation and reflection. On the other hand, Microsoft founder Bill Gates said, “Most of the ‘knowledge’ on which the knowledge economy is built is actually just information — data, facts and basic business intelligence. Knowledge itself is more profound. It’s the knowledge derived from information that gives you a competitive edge…”<BR><BR>ICT has the power to produce change in human lives and events. Knowledge transforms human potentials. Development is known as both a process and an end; knowledge should be understood in the same way. Tim Berners-Lee, who is the renowned inventor of the World Wide Web, describes knowledge as “more than the sum of its parts.” Concomitant with that awareness of knowledge is accepting the inevitability of change. By harnessing the transformative power of knowledge gained through the use of ICT, we can be empowered by the capacity to control how knowledge and change can bring us to our destiny.<BR><BR>Somehow that comes across as too general — neither here nor there. A more specific way to look at the “transformative power” of ICT is in the context of governance. We all know that any technology also has its pros and cons: when used correctly, technology enables more efficient businesses (including the business of governance), further democratizes education, and of course enhances communications, among others. Thus, ICT advances will hopefully lead to peace and greater human development or improved standards of living, as general outcomes aimed for by government. However, potential outcomes are not all positive — and it would be wishful thinking to believe that ICT’s potential outcomes would always be positive.<BR><BR>Greater efficiency in work through ICT would lead to changes in how much work is done — and this often disrupts many people (‘redundancy,’ then ‘retrenchment’). More communication means that not only good ideas but also bad or flawed ones could go around very quickly. Today’s “high-pressure marketing” methods are eroding people’s privacy and individuality (names, numbers and addresses in humongous databases). Changes in the economy could be beneficial in some places but harmful in others, which tend to widen the gap between the “haves” and the “have-nots.” At the bottomline, it is not just the technology itself but, more importantly, how it is used.<BR><BR>But how many people really know and understand what technology is bringing to the table? Let’s face it — we are easily misled (for example, by the recent spate of alarmist media play-up of the dangers of the Fukushima nuclear plant mishaps, primarily because not too many people are privy to what really goes on in nuclear power plants). Leaders and politicians typically have superior information and tools (‘privileged information’ and ‘the mechanisms and perquisites of power’). Ordinary people (the majority) therefore are placed at a distinct disadvantage. Supposedly, there is a balance between government and the governed — i.e. government takes its cue from the mandate of the people, which is why ours is called a “republic” (which comes from Latin phrase res publica — “of the public or people;” also, commonwealth). However, only by being aware of how things should properly be (as, for instance, the delivery of basic services) that we are able to enforce our inherent moral right to expect government to perform according to expectations. With ICT, we have the best chances of increasing and improving our awareness — as well as our effectiveness in applying social pressure on government, its leaders/politicians, business corporations, and other social institutions. <BR><BR>At any rate, the question is — will ICT’s use be a boon, or a bane?

Like! I would suggest, however, that the underlying disease might be more profound than this. It is called “colonial mentality” (sometimes “mental colony,” to be funny) which has unfortunately woven itself into the fabric of Pinoy culture. I think this is indeed a worthwhile topic for Filipinos to discuss with introspection, and perhaps come up with better understanding and appreciation of what a true Filipino is, or what a true Filipino should be. And to promote the use of Pinoy products and services, which can be more innovative than western ones. One obvious symptom of the disease is manifested in many Pinoys who worship Manila celebrities with pale skin, nose job, and blonde-dyed hair (regardless of their non-talent in acting or singing). It’s depressing to see Pinoys watch in awe as those celebrities brag about their latest trip to the U.S. or Europe, speaking in that obnoxious, quasi-language called “Tag-lish.” Real Pinoys can do better than that, and show the world a unique race that we can all be proud of.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Moses Alcala</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Fil-Am environmental consultant geologist</span><br style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">New Jersey, USA</span><br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The scholarship is presented by Rev.

Noble of class 2008-2009. It was then for a modest amount of Php5,000.<br><br>As a continuing legacy embodied by her son’s spirit of true leadership, Mrs. Calderon-Khan expanded the gift which became a scholarship grant to the basic tuition fee of the incoming CAT Corps Commander, Cadette Lieutenant Colonel Mejorah Roz C. Pangilinan of class 2009 – 2010. <br><br>Rosemarie recalls George’s determined enthusiasm to aspire for the CAT (Citizens Army Training) leadership position. She said, “My son, George, talked to me when he was third year in high school and informed me that he wanted to be Corps Commander. He said, ‘But with Lolo's curfew (6 p.m.) at Calo, I will not be able to make it as Corps Commander and the soccer team.’ So, we transferred to Dumaguete City to the chagrin of Dad. Our first meal for the four of us was a can of sardines with lots of soup and rice. After we were stabilized and recalled that moment, George said, ‘You know mommy, if you cried… I would have cried too.’ For that sacrifice he made it to be Corps Commander and to the soccer team.<br><br><span class=\"GBThreadMessageRow_ReportLink\"></span><br><br>        <div class=\"GBThreadMessageRow_Body\"><br><br>        <div class=\"GBThreadMessageRow_Body_Content\"><br><br>        George died in August 1994.

   "body": "<BR><BR>March 25, 2011 would be remembered as a busy day in the life of the Special Court for Drug Cases as it rendered judgments in 12 cases submitted for resolution.  Four of the cases were promulgated in two joint judgments.{{more}}<BR><BR>On that day, the Court sentenced two drug pushers, Adam Sun and Jojo Ejan, to life terms. They were also fined P500,000 each. The two convicts were caught in separate buy-bust operations some three years ago in  barangay Looc and barangay 2, respectively.<BR><BR>In these cases, the Court ruled that the prosecution was able to establish the essential elements of the offense charged, especially presenting evidence that the transaction actually took place, along with the presentation in court of the illegal substance which constituted the corpus delicti.  The Court found the testimonies of prosecution witness who were eyewitnesses to the transaction to be clear, straightforward and worthy of credence. <BR><BR>Both accused Sun and Ejan tried to wiggle themselves out of their respective cases by claiming that the informant-poseur buyer was not presented in Court.  The court ruled that the non-presentation of the informant-poseur buyer cannot prejudice the prosecution’s theory of the case.  As a rule, it is rare for the prosecutor to present the informant because of the need to hide the latter’s identity and preserve his invaluable service to the police.   <BR><BR>In another case, the Court sentenced four other persons to suffer an indeterminate penalty of twelve (12) years and one (1) day as minimum term to fourteen (14) years as maximum term and to pay a fine of Four Hundred Thousand Pesos (P400,000.00) for drug possession.<BR><BR>Sentenced were Jesus Gadiana, Winben Salmorin Jasper Real and Leo Escartin Janio. <BR><BR>They were all found guilty of illegal possession of dangerous drugs in violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.  All four accused just simply denied the charges against them. <BR><BR>The Court said denial is an inherently weak defense and in the light the evidence presented by the prosecution, such denial would certainly fail. <BR><BR>Comparing the defense versions with that of the prosecution as to what really happened on the dates referred to, the Court found the account of the prosecution witnesses more credible, the Court said.<BR><BR>Aside from the presumption that the arresting officers regularly performed their duties, the Court noted that the prosecution witnesses gave a consistent and straightforward narration of what transpired on the different days in question. <BR><BR>In the case of the fourth suspect, Janio, he jumped bail in the course of the trial and was no longer able to present evidence in his behalf.  The Court noted that flight is an indication of guilt.<BR><BR>In four other cases promulgated on the same day, five (5) persons escaped imprisonment as the Court acquitted them of the charges filed against them based on reasonable doubt. <BR><BR>Acquitted in various cases were Mediolyn Amigo, Felice Jane Quiaoit. Allan Diputado, Marilou Tondo and Romeo Merecido. <BR><BR>In all these cases, the Court found wanting in evidence on the identity and integrity of the seized drugs, which evidence must definitely show that the illegal drug presented in court is the same illegal drug actually recovered from the accused.<BR><BR>The Court noted that serious flaws in the conduct of the post-seizure custody of the dangerous drug allegedly bought or seized from these accused weakened the prosecution’s cause as it cast doubts on the identity of the corpus delicti but also tend to discredit, if not totally negate, the claim of regularity in the conduct of official police operations.<BR><BR>While the common defense raised by the different accused in their different cases was denial, which is inherently weak, the Court said the conviction of the different accused must rest not on the weakness of their respective defenses but on the strength of the prosecution.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

   "body": "<BR>For an accomplished lawyer like Antonio Oposa, the secret to success does not lie in chasing material things. Rather, it is in doing things that make you happy, keeping a simple lifestyle, and having a cause greater than yourself.<BR><BR>Oposa, a recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Awards in 2009, was again honored last March 20 with a Doctor of Humanities degree from Foundation University, where he was also the speaker in its 62nd commencement.<BR><BR>Ever the non-conformist, Oposa gave not the usual commencement address but a series of stories -- complete with entertaining and funny visuals flashed on screen that occasionally brought the house down.<BR><BR>Underlying all his anecdotes were life’s basic lessons: “Examine your life, find your passion, and follow your heart,” he said, “because no matter what it is -– arts, sports, environment, education, etc. – you will wake up excited for the day, and end the day in sleep with a smile on your face.”<BR><BR>On living simply, Oposa said, “You will seek goals that are bigger than material things, bigger than yourself.” In so doing, he said, you will find real meaning in your life.<BR><BR>“Use your gifts, talents, and skills to pursue a greater good.  Any great movement may be born in the minds of a few, but it must be spoken by the mouths of many, and must be carried on the shoulders of all – of every man, woman, and child.”<BR><BR>And the ultimate secret to success, he says, is to give the credit to everyone. “There is no limit to what you can achieve when you do not care who gets the credit.”<BR><BR>And with these secrets, Oposa is out to conquer the enemies of nature.   <BR>       <BR>“Everything that I have done in the past was only a warm up. The main events are about to begin,” he promised.<BR><BR>Oposa talked about his School of the SEA (Sea, Earth, Air) in his beachside property in Bantayan, Cebu which, in partnership with Foundation University and other institutions, will create a new generation of Filipinos who will understand the beauty and bounty of our country, and take care of it better than we have in our generation.<BR><BR>There will also be a Sailing School of the SEA to visit islands in the Visayan sea to teach the young and whoever wants to listen, he said.<BR><BR>The latest project to excite Oposa is his Road Revolution. He wants to reverse the concept of road use, from having a bias for cars to a bias for people.<BR><BR>Only three percent of the people own cars yet, they hog 99 percent of the road. “This should be changed,” Oposa said, outlining his formula of dividing the road into four—30 percent for four-wheeled vehicles, 30 percent for pedestrians, 30 percent for bicycles, and 10 percent for vegetable gardens.<BR><BR>This, he said, will help in fighting the effects of climate change.<BR><BR>“On June 12, we will begin the revolution in Cebu, where children will submit a petition using Sec. 120-127 of the Local Government Code to close down roads of Cebu to motor vehicles,” he said.<BR><BR>June 12, Independence Day, is also the day they will declare Filipino independence from fossil fuels, Oposa said.<BR><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br></body><BR></html><BR>",

That sets the tone for the film: it will be about speech and the hurdles one had to triumph over in order to find the voice that will inform and connect people. At the time the film is set, which is that decade of troubled peacetime before World War II erupted, this newfangled technology—really an extension of the human voice—has become a necessary disruption to the ways that things have always been done. As Prince Albert’s dying father King George V wearily tells him, it was no longer enough to just sit on a horse and look like a monarch to rally a nation; with the microphone, one had to speak to them like you were a guest in the hearts of their homes. Alas for Prince Albert, who is played with convincing nobility <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">and</span> frailty by Colin Firth, that reality is the stuff of personal nightmare: he has a bad stutter.<br><br>In the beginning scenes of Hooper’s film, we view with increasing trepidation a demonstration of that debility: he speaks, in behalf of his father, to a huge crowd gathered for a Commonwealth event at Wembley, and as he begins to deliver the speech to a microphone in front of him, we cringe with pity and mortification. The question becomes: how do you become an effective ruler of a nation if you don’t have a voice that your people can rally around?<br><br>Fast-forward to a scene in Buckingham Palace, after the coronation of Prince Albert, now renamed King George VI, who becomes an unwilling monarch after the abdication of his brother to pursue love in a divorced woman. The family is watching a film newsreel capturing the coronation ceremonies in Westminster Abbey. When that segment ends, the reel segues quickly to a report of Hitler speaking with such animated oratorical power to the German masses. We see a magician at work: Hitler’s forceful words sounds like an opiate, and the crowd responds accordingly. The young Princess Elizabeth turns to her father and asks him: “What’s he saying?” And the king replies: “I don’t know but ... he seems to be saying it rather well.”<br><br>And there you have it, the film in its thematic nutshell: the world will be won by one who has the voice. If evil is eloquent and persuasive, and the only one who can stand in its way keeps tripping over his tongue, can evil triumph? Which is why the drama of the film ultimately leads to the king’s first wartime speech—something ornate and persuasive and lasts 10 minutes for full delivery. He is to deliver it over the radio to the rest of the country, to people hanging on to his words to get a feel, if not comfort, of the challenges to come and the heroism required of them as the dark days of war loom ever closer. It is a formidable task.<br><br>But there is Lionel Logue, an Australian actor who has claims for curing people with speech defects, played with such wit by Geoffrey Rush. The film tells the story of his adventures in elocution with the future king, chronicling the unique methods they use to overcome the central debility of the story. The final speech becomes their most dramatic project, and when it comes, you will... But I won’t divulge anything more. <br><br>One has to see this brilliant film to appreciate this true story, something Mr. Hooper has done great service in the way he has directed it to a film with a heart and a unique musicality, with honors to composer Alexandre Desplat and a fine use of Beethoven’s <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Symphony 7 Allegretto Movement No. 2.</span> Mr. Hooper makes us care for the people whose stories we see here, and Mr. Firth, Mr. Rush, and Ms. Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth extend that by embodying the roles with such clear-eyed empathy. We become fully invested in their dilemmas, and so when we get to the end, their triumph becomes our own as well. I have never cheered this way for a speech before, but cheer I did. You will find yourself cheering for the rest of this wonderful film as well.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">        * * *<br></div><br><br>        Something has to be said about a film where awful people in awful circumstances doing awful things still generate a good deal of compassion and kindness despite what darkness overwhelms. Call that darkness what you will—the winter, the stark poverty, the violence, the drugs that litter this broken landscape. And yet this is as much a story of the good people do for each other in some sly, sometimes belated, way—a glimmer of humanity that remains when much has been effaced. That is what I get from Debra Granik’s painful and beautiful <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Winter’s Bone</span> [2010], the unflinching story of a 17-year-old girl named Ree who lives with two small siblings and an incapacitated mother in the cold, unforgiving poverty of the Ozark Mountains. She may be young, but the gravity of a fifty-year-old lies in undercurrents in her poker face as she goes about taking care of them as much as she can, with some rare help from neighbors who are burdened with problems of their own. But one day, she gets this bad news: her imprisoned father, out on bond, seems to have disappeared and is likely unable to attend his own court hearing. His bond includes the deeds to the house and property, and if he does not show up, Ree and her family will be forced to vacate. “I’ll find him,” Ree tells the sheriff, with a grimness that speaks volumes. This is her story, a plucky girl who begins to ask uncomfortable questions, stirring the dead and the ones who want to keep their silence. She begins her search, a frightful task that includes meeting up with some unsavory characters, and bearing some bruises that are part and parcel of that search. The film centers its entire universe in the performance of Jennifer Lawrence who plays Ree with a quiet conviction that draws you in with such power. This is such a painful film to watch, and yet I stayed riveted all throughout because of her. I’m not sure I can watch this film again, but I know for sure that I am mighty glad to have seen it.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",

The sheriff thought to himself, “That’s not what I meant, but he’s right.”  Then the sheriff asked, “What two days of the week start with the letter ‘T’?” “Today & tomorrow,” replied the applicant.  The sheriff was again surprised over the answer, one that he had never thought of himself.<br><br>“Now, listen carefully, who killed Abraham Lincoln?” asked the sheriff.  The job seeker seemed a little surprised, then thought really hard for a minute and finally admitted, “I don’t know.” The sheriff replied, “Well, why don’t you go home and work on that one for a while?”  The applicant left and wandered over to his friends who were waiting to hear the results of the interview.  He greeted them with a cheery smile, “The job is mine!  The interview went great!  First day on the job and I’m already working on a murder case!”<br><br>In our Gospel reading this morning in Matthew 4 it is Jesus’ first day on the job.  Immediately he is confronted with three major temptations.  <br><br>Matthew tells us of the Spirit leading Jesus into the wilderness where he stayed there and fasted for 40 days and forty nights.  While praying, the devil came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread.”  Jesus answered, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.’”  The devil then took him to the holy city, set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, ‘He will give his angels charge of you,’ and ‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”  Again Jesus resisted by saying, “it is written, ‘you shall not tempt the Lord your God.’’  Finally, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them; and he said to him, “all these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.”  But Jesus said, “Begone, Satan!  For it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve.’”  <br><br>Then Matthew continued to say, “the devil left him and behold the angels came and ministered to him.”  Reflecting on the significance of this story it shows me some truths about life and discipleship.  Let me share with you some of them.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">         I<br></div><br><br>        First, it tells me that as we journey through life, there are temptations on the way.  There was this pastor who said, “Opportunity knocks only once, but temptation bangs on your door for years.”  Jesus who is the Son of God was not exempted from this kind of life.  He too like us went through temptations and difficulties right from the time he started his ministry up to the time when he was crucified.  Time and time again, Jesus was confronted with this basic question: Would he take the crown without the cross?  Would he use power to gain people to God instead of love?  Would he enter into partnership with the devil to get what he wants?<br><br>Temptation is a very real part of our lives wherever we are.  We encounter temptations that will pull us from the values we hold very dear.  We are sometimes tempted to take short cuts, to avoid struggle, to find the easy way at the expense of certain values which we hold on to.  And many times, we think that the only way to handle temptation is to yield to it.<br><br>     I was talking to a group of students just recently.  I asked them how many of them cheated at one time or another.  And all of them raised their hands.  And if you read the news these days, you read government officials accused of cheating.  And the worse is that it is accepted as part of the system.  And they do not feel guilty unless they are caught.<br><br>One time, identical notes were sent to twenty most prominent men in London, saying, “All is discovered.  Escape while you can.”  All twenty abruptly left town.<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">      II<br></div><br><br>        Secondly, reading the story of Jesus in the wilderness, I could just imagine him, without food in the wilderness with temperatures varying from one extreme to the other.  It is a place which some called as “the Devastation.”  One writer describes it as an area of crumbling sand where the ridges run in all directions as if they were warped and twisted.  The rocks are bare and jagged.  It glows and shimmers with heat like some vast furnace.” (Barclay)  However, Jesus went through all these, as he struggled with the kind of ministry God had called him to do.<br><br>There are also times in our lives when we have to go through difficulties and suffering just like what Jesus went through in the wilderness.  When earthquakes, typhoons tsunamis, flooding come our way, we say, “When it rains it pours.”  Sometimes it seems that way - that everything goes wrong all at once.  (Actually, this was an advertising slogan of Morton Salt several years ago.)    <br><br>Forbes magazine printed an interesting little item sometime back.  It said, “Mosquitoes cause us trouble but not as much as they could.  There are about 41,000 mosquitoes for each of us.”  Imagine 41,000 mosquitoes biting you at the same time?  Of course it does not happen, but there are times in our lives when we feel that 41,000 mosquitoes are ganging up on us at once.  Those are moments when it seems that problems, difficulties and temptations in life are too much and there is no end to it.  And we keep on asking God, “why?” “Where is the God who promised to take care of me?”<br><br><br><br>        <div style=\"text-align: center;\">         III<br></div><br><br>        However, we are also told in this story that God sends ministering angels to us as we enter into the wilderness of life.  That is the Good News for the day.  God did not leave Jesus to deal with the trials and temptations alone.  God did not leave him there to wrestle alone the difficulties.  Instead, God sent angels to minister to him.<br><br>In times when we too feel that temptations become overwhelming, in times when we feel that there is no end to our suffering, God sends angels to minister to us.  The One who created us assures us that his grace is greater than our need.  When St. Paul cried out in anguish at the thorn in his flesh, he was answered with a mighty word of hope, “My grace is sufficient for you.”  According to the Interpreter’s Bible Commentary, “God the Creator has blessed us from our birth.  His providence has sustained us on our way.  His help is all about us before we know enough to ask for it.”  According to the Psalmist, “God preserves us from trouble; God surrounds us with glad cries of deliverance.”  Yes, God sends his angels to minister to us as we go through difficulties and temptations in life.  God’s angel may be a friend who is willing to listen to us; or a stranger who comes unexpected to us offering some help; or someone in the church who expresses his or her concern; or someone else whose presence is an inspiration.  It could be members of our family who surround us with their love and care.  God works in different ways. And we are assured that the One who calls us to ministry sends angels who are always there when we need some help.<br><br>A man by the name of Richard Lederer collects funny signs. Some of these are simply the result of people in foreign countries having difficulty translating into English. He says that at the entrance to a hotel swimming pool on the French Riviera there is a sign that reads like this: “Swimming is forbidden in the absence of a saviour.”<br><br>Maybe the person who put up that sign knew English better than we may suppose.  Not only swimming but life itself should not be lived in the absence of a Saviour.<br><br>As we therefore journey through the wilderness of trials and temptations during this season of lent, let us remember that in times when we need some help, God will send his angels to minister to us.<br><br><br><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\"></span><a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://dumaguetemetropost.com/index68.htm\"><span style=\"font-style: italic; color: #1826ff;\">(Back to MetroPost HOME PAGE)</span></a><br><br><br><br><br><br>    </body><br><br></html>",
